"00:01:59,455","00:02:02,445",People are always asking me if I know Tyler Durden.
"00:02:03,533","00:02:04,328",Three minutes.
"00:02:04,412","00:02:06,641",This is it. Ground zero.
"00:02:06,731","00:02:10,244",Would you like to say a few words to mark the occasion?
"00:02:10,329","00:02:13,718","With a gun barrel between your teeth, you speak only in vowels."
"00:02:13,808","00:02:15,798",I can't think of anything.
"00:02:15,886","00:02:19,594",For a second I totally forget about Tyler's whole controlled demolition thing
"00:02:19,684","00:02:21,753",and I wonder how clean that gun is.
"00:02:21,843","00:02:23,833",Getting exciting now.
"00:02:23,922","00:02:26,958","That old thing, how you always hurt the one you love."
"00:02:27,041","00:02:29,031","Well, it works both ways."
"00:02:29,120","00:02:33,235",We have front row seats for this theatre of Mass Destruction.
"00:02:33,317","00:02:35,955",The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem
"00:02:36,036","00:02:39,344",wrapped the foundation columns of a dozen buildings with blastin gelatin.
"00:02:40,074","00:02:43,303","In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges"
"00:02:43,392","00:02:46,621",and a few blocks will be reduced to smouldering rubble.
"00:02:46,710","00:02:49,621","I know this, because Tyler knows this."
"00:02:49,709","00:02:52,938",Two and a half. Think of everything we've accomplished.
"00:02:53,027","00:02:58,178","Suddenly I realise that all of this: the gun, the bombs, the revolution..."
"00:02:58,264","00:03:01,414",has got something to do with a girl named Marla Singer.
"00:03:03,822","00:03:06,095",Bob. Bob had bitch tits.
"00:03:06,180","00:03:10,171",This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.
"00:03:10,258","00:03:13,408","The big moosie slobbering all overme, that was Bob."
"00:03:13,497","00:03:15,565",We're still men.
"00:03:15,655","00:03:17,770","Yes, we're men."
"00:03:17,854","00:03:19,923",Men is what we are.
"00:03:20,013","00:03:23,321","Eight month ago, Bob's testicles were removed. Then hormone therapy."
"00:03:23,411","00:03:27,038",He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high
"00:03:27,129","00:03:29,164",and his body upped the estrogen.
"00:03:29,248","00:03:32,795",- That was where I fit... - They're gonna have to open my pecs again
"00:03:32,886","00:03:35,240",..between those huge sweating tits
"00:03:35,325","00:03:39,396","that hung enormous, the way you'd think of God's as big."
"00:03:39,483","00:03:41,598","OK, you cry now."
"00:03:41,682","00:03:44,115","No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier."
"00:03:45,320","00:03:47,958","For six months, I couldn't sleep."
"00:03:48,039","00:03:50,471",I couldn't sleep.
"00:03:50,557","00:03:52,626","With insomnia, nothing's real."
"00:03:52,716","00:03:54,706",Everything's far away.
"00:03:55,595","00:03:57,868","Everything is a copy, of a copy,"
"00:03:57,953","00:03:59,908",of a copy.
"00:04:02,111","00:04:07,466","When deep space exploration ramps up, it'll be the corporations that name everything:"
"00:04:07,548","00:04:09,538",The IBM Stellar Sphere.
"00:04:09,827","00:04:11,817",The Microsoft Galaxy.
"00:04:11,906","00:04:13,896",Planet Starbucks.
"00:04:14,425","00:04:17,381","Gonna need you out-of-town a little more this week. We've got some ""red-flags"" to cover."
"00:04:17,463","00:04:20,897","It must have been Tuesday. He was wearing his ""cornflower-blue"" tie."
"00:04:20,981","00:04:25,370",You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
"00:04:25,459","00:04:29,848","Make these your primary ""action items"". Here are your flight coupons."
"00:04:29,937","00:04:33,644",He was full of pep. Must've had his grande latte enema.
"00:04:34,734","00:04:39,647","Like so many others, I had become a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct."
"00:04:39,732","00:04:42,006",Yes. I'd like to order
"00:04:42,090","00:04:44,239",the Erika Peccary dust ruffles.
"00:04:44,329","00:04:46,364","- Please hold. - If I saw something clever,"
"00:04:46,448","00:04:50,644","like coffee table in the shape of a yin and yang, I had to have it."
"00:04:51,646","00:04:53,919","The Klipske personal office unit,"
"00:04:54,004","00:04:56,198",The Hovertrekke home exer-bike.
"00:04:56,563","00:04:59,951",Or the Johannshamnh sofa with the Strinne green stripe pattern.
"00:05:00,041","00:05:05,271",Even the Rislampa wire lamps of environmentally-friendly unbleached paper.
"00:05:05,358","00:05:08,076",I would flip through catalogs and wonder
"00:05:08,157","00:05:11,067","""What kind of dining set defines me as a person?"""
"00:05:11,155","00:05:15,749","I had it all. Even the glass dishes with tiny bubbles and imperfections,"
"00:05:15,833","00:05:20,699","proof that they were crafted by the honest, simple, hard-working, indigenous peoples of..."
"00:05:20,790","00:05:23,622",- Please hold. - ..wherever.
"00:05:24,109","00:05:26,144",We used to read pornography.
"00:05:26,228","00:05:28,945",Now it was the Horchow Collection.
"00:05:29,026","00:05:32,255",- No. You can't die from insomnia. - What about narcolepsy?
"00:05:32,344","00:05:34,618","I nod off, I wake up in strange places."
"00:05:34,703","00:05:36,693",I have no idea how I got there.
"00:05:36,782","00:05:40,409",- You need to lighten up. - Can you please just give me something?
"00:05:40,500","00:05:43,968",Red and blue Tuinal lipstick-red seconals.
"00:05:44,378","00:05:47,652","No. You need healthy, natural sleep."
"00:05:48,376","00:05:51,684",Chew some valerian root and get some more exercise.
"00:05:53,653","00:05:55,643","Hey, come on."
"00:05:55,732","00:05:57,722",- I'm in pain. - You wanna see pain?
"00:05:57,811","00:06:00,244","Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights."
"00:06:00,330","00:06:03,286",See the guys with testicular cancer.
"00:06:03,368","00:06:05,358",That's pain.
"00:06:20,599","00:06:23,874",I always wanted three kids... two boys and a girl.
"00:06:23,958","00:06:26,231",Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.
"00:06:27,756","00:06:30,143",We never could agree on anything.
"00:06:30,474","00:06:32,191","Well, I... She..."
"00:06:32,273","00:06:34,661",She had her first child last week.
"00:06:34,752","00:06:36,901",A girl.
"00:06:36,991","00:06:40,106",With... With her... With her new husband.
"00:06:40,909","00:06:42,899",Fuck!
"00:06:44,147","00:06:46,137","Thank God, you know..."
"00:06:46,226","00:06:48,216",I'm glad for her.
"00:06:48,985","00:06:51,816",Because she deserves it...
"00:06:55,501","00:06:59,174","Everyone, let's thank Thomas for sharing himself with us."
"00:06:59,259","00:07:01,249","Thank you, Thomas."
"00:07:01,338","00:07:04,646","I look around this room, and I see a lot of courage."
"00:07:04,736","00:07:06,726",And that gives me strength.
"00:07:06,815","00:07:09,044",We give each other strength.
"00:07:09,134","00:07:11,328",It's time for the one-on-ones.
"00:07:11,893","00:07:16,122",So let's all of us follow Thomas's good example and really open ourselves.
"00:07:16,210","00:07:18,200",Could you find a partner?
"00:07:20,288","00:07:23,324",And this is how I met the big moosie.
"00:07:24,926","00:07:27,996",His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.
"00:07:30,363","00:07:33,035","Knees together, those awkward little steps."
"00:07:38,039","00:07:40,074",- My name is Bob. - Bob?
"00:07:40,718","00:07:42,912",Bob had been a champion body-builder.
"00:07:42,996","00:07:46,510",You know that chest expansion program you see on late night TV?
"00:07:46,595","00:07:48,585",That was his idea.
"00:07:48,674","00:07:50,663",I was a juicer.
"00:07:50,752","00:07:52,787","You know, using steroids?"
"00:07:52,871","00:07:55,259",Diabonol and
"00:07:55,350","00:07:57,579",Wisterol.
"00:07:57,669","00:08:01,421","Oh, they use that on racehorses, for Christsakes."
"00:08:01,907","00:08:03,897",And now I'm bankrupt.
"00:08:04,745","00:08:06,735",I'm divorced.
"00:08:07,464","00:08:09,454",My two grown kids
"00:08:10,302","00:08:12,861",won't even return my phone calls.
"00:08:12,941","00:08:17,807",Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one.
"00:08:19,537","00:08:21,527","Go ahead,... Cornelius."
"00:08:21,616","00:08:23,606",You can cry.
"00:08:38,688","00:08:41,996",And then... something happened. I let go.
"00:08:42,086","00:08:44,076",That's really good.
"00:08:44,165","00:08:46,155",Lost in oblivion.
"00:08:46,244","00:08:48,437",Dark and silent and complete.
"00:08:51,321","00:08:54,868",I found freedom. Losing all hope was freedom.
"00:08:57,238","00:08:59,228",It's OK.
"00:09:01,396","00:09:03,511",Babies don't sleep this well.
"00:09:06,993","00:09:09,460",I became addicted.
"00:09:22,585","00:09:24,575",If I didn't say anything
"00:09:24,664","00:09:27,222",people always assumed the worst.
"00:09:30,940","00:09:33,851",They cried harder... then I cried harder.
"00:09:42,894","00:09:46,885","Now we're going to open the green door, the heart chakra..."
"00:09:46,972","00:09:48,962",I wasn't really dying.
"00:09:49,091","00:09:51,729",I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.
"00:09:52,609","00:09:56,441",I was the warm little centre that the life of this world crowded around.
"00:09:57,287","00:10:00,118",Imagine your pain as a white ball of healing light.
"00:10:00,205","00:10:04,162","It moves over your body, healing you."
"00:10:04,243","00:10:07,597",Now keep this going. Remember to breathe
"00:10:07,681","00:10:11,228",and step forward through the back door of the room.
"00:10:12,039","00:10:14,074",Where does it lead?
"00:10:14,158","00:10:16,193",To your cave.
"00:10:16,277","00:10:18,073",Step forward
"00:10:18,156","00:10:20,271",into your cave.
"00:10:20,355","00:10:22,345",That's right.
"00:10:22,434","00:10:25,742",You're going deeper into your cave.
"00:10:26,432","00:10:28,421",And you're going to find
"00:10:28,510","00:10:30,500",your power animal.
"00:10:32,548","00:10:33,822",Slide.
"00:10:44,462","00:10:46,452",Every evening I died.
"00:10:47,581","00:10:50,139",And every evening I was born again.
"00:10:50,699","00:10:52,689",Resurrected.
"00:10:54,617","00:10:58,688",Bob loved me because he thought my testicles were removed too.
"00:10:58,775","00:11:01,446","Being there, pressed agains these tits,"
"00:11:01,533","00:11:03,523",ready to cry.
"00:11:03,612","00:11:06,171",This was my vacation.
"00:11:08,370","00:11:09,927",And she
"00:11:10,009","00:11:12,568",ruined everything.
"00:11:12,647","00:11:14,637","This is cancer, right?"
"00:11:17,445","00:11:19,560","This chick, Marla Singer,"
"00:11:19,644","00:11:22,203",did not have testicular cancer.
"00:11:22,282","00:11:24,272",She was a liar.
"00:11:24,361","00:11:26,351",She had no diseases at all.
"00:11:26,440","00:11:30,067","I had seen her at ""Free And Clear"", my blood parasites group, Thursdays."
"00:11:30,158","00:11:33,467","Then at Hope, my bimonthly sickle cell circle."
"00:11:33,956","00:11:38,709","And again, at ""Seize The Day"", my tuberculosis, Friday night."
"00:11:39,793","00:11:41,703","Marla,"
"00:11:41,792","00:11:44,180",the big tourist.
"00:11:44,271","00:11:46,261",Her lie reflected my lie.
"00:11:46,790","00:11:48,780","And suddenly, I felt nothing."
"00:11:48,869","00:11:52,337","I couldn't cry. So once again,"
"00:11:52,427","00:11:54,417",I couldn't sleep.
"00:12:04,940","00:12:07,328","Next group, after guided meditation,"
"00:12:07,419","00:12:10,693","after we open our heart chakras, when it's time to hug,"
"00:12:10,777","00:12:13,813","I'm gonna grab that little bitch, Marla Singer, and scream."
"00:12:13,896","00:12:17,728","Marla, you liar! You big tourist, I need this! Now, get out!"
"00:12:19,733","00:12:22,006",I hadn't slept in four days.
"00:12:22,091","00:12:23,887",We'll just let that dry...
"00:12:23,970","00:12:27,279","When you have insomnia, you're never really asleep."
"00:12:27,369","00:12:29,722",And you're never really awake.
"00:12:30,847","00:12:33,235","To begin tonight's communion,"
"00:12:33,326","00:12:35,963",Chloe would like to say a few words.
"00:12:36,084","00:12:38,881","Oh, yeah. Chloe."
"00:12:39,722","00:12:44,475",Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton would look if you made it smile and walk around
"00:12:44,560","00:12:46,550",a party being extra nice to everybody.
"00:12:46,998","00:12:48,988","Well, I'm still here."
"00:12:49,357","00:12:51,392",But I don't know for how long.
"00:12:52,196","00:12:55,186",That's as much certainty as anyone can give me.
"00:12:55,274","00:12:57,150",But I've got some good news.
"00:12:57,233","00:13:00,826",I no longer have any fear of death.
"00:13:04,589","00:13:08,182",But... I am in a pretty lonely place.
"00:13:09,187","00:13:11,177",No one will have sex with me.
"00:13:12,305","00:13:16,501","I'm so close to the end, and all I want is to get laid for the last time."
"00:13:17,103","00:13:20,411","I have pornographic movies in my apartment,"
"00:13:20,501","00:13:24,048","- and lubricants and amyl nitrite. - Thank you, Chloe."
"00:13:24,739","00:13:26,774","Everyone, let's thank Chloe."
"00:13:26,858","00:13:28,893","Thank you, Chloe."
"00:13:31,615","00:13:35,288","Now, let's ready ourselves for guided meditation."
"00:13:36,373","00:13:39,602",You're standing at the entrance of your cave.
"00:13:40,091","00:13:43,399",You step inside your cave and you walk...
"00:13:43,489","00:13:46,480","If I did have a tumour, I'd name it Marla."
"00:13:47,487","00:13:49,397",Marla.
"00:13:49,486","00:13:53,762",The little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if you could stop tonguing it.
"00:13:53,844","00:13:55,834",But you can't.
"00:13:56,722","00:13:59,474",..deeper into your cave as you walk.
"00:13:59,561","00:14:02,949",You feel a healing energy all around you.
"00:14:05,478","00:14:07,468",Now find your power animal.
"00:14:10,235","00:14:12,190",Slide.
"00:14:15,552","00:14:18,827",OK. Let's partner up.
"00:14:18,911","00:14:21,140",Pick someone special to you tonight.
"00:14:27,106","00:14:29,096",Hey.
"00:14:29,465","00:14:31,455",- We need to talk. - Sure.
"00:14:36,062","00:14:38,052",- I'm onto you. - What?
"00:14:38,141","00:14:41,131",Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.
"00:14:41,219","00:14:42,936",Sorry?
"00:14:43,018","00:14:47,806","In the Tibetan philosophy, Sylvia Plath sense of the word, I know we're all dying."
"00:14:47,896","00:14:51,933",- But you're not dying the way Chloe back there is dying. - So?
"00:14:52,493","00:14:54,483",So you're a tourist.
"00:14:54,572","00:14:58,609","I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma, I saw you at tuberculosis."
"00:14:58,690","00:15:01,078",I saw you at testicular cancer!
"00:15:01,169","00:15:02,760",I saw you practising this.
"00:15:02,848","00:15:05,156",- Practising what? - Telling me off.
"00:15:05,247","00:15:08,920","Is it going as well as you hoped,... ""Rupert""?"
"00:15:09,005","00:15:10,722",I'll expose you.
"00:15:10,804","00:15:12,794",Go ahead. I'll expose you.
"00:15:13,522","00:15:16,274",Come together. Let yourselves cry.
"00:15:22,997","00:15:24,987","Oh, God. Why are you doing this?"
"00:15:25,076","00:15:27,748",It's cheaper than a movie and there's free coffee.
"00:15:27,835","00:15:30,472","Look, this is important. OK? These are my groups."
"00:15:30,553","00:15:32,588",I've been coming here for over a year.
"00:15:32,672","00:15:35,743",- Why do you do it? - I don't know.
"00:15:35,831","00:15:39,504","When people think you're dying, they really, really listen to you instead of just..."
"00:15:39,589","00:15:42,465",Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
"00:15:43,707","00:15:45,697",Yeah. Yeah.
"00:15:46,825","00:15:49,577",Share yourself... completely.
"00:15:50,343","00:15:52,333","Look, you don't want to get into this."
"00:15:52,422","00:15:54,412",- It becomes an addiction. - Really?
"00:15:54,501","00:15:58,572","I'm not kidding. I can't cry if there's another faker person, and I need this."
"00:15:58,659","00:16:00,649",You got to find somewhere else to go.
"00:16:00,738","00:16:04,172",Candy-stripe a cancer ward. It's not my problem.
"00:16:07,174","00:16:09,164","No, wait a second. Hold on."
"00:16:09,253","00:16:11,243","We'll split up the week, OK?"
"00:16:11,332","00:16:13,447",You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.
"00:16:13,531","00:16:16,522",You take tuberculosis. My smoking doesn't go over at all.
"00:16:16,610","00:16:19,759",OK. Good. Fine. Testicular cancer should be no contest.
"00:16:19,848","00:16:23,600","Well, technically. I have more of a right to be there than you. You still have your balls."
"00:16:23,686","00:16:25,960",- You're kidding. - I don't know. Am I?
"00:16:26,604","00:16:28,003",No. No.
"00:16:28,084","00:16:30,596",- What do you want? - I'll take the parasites.
"00:16:30,682","00:16:33,354",You can't have both parasites. Take the blood parasites.
"00:16:33,441","00:16:37,591",- I want brain parasites. - I'll take the blood parasites and organic brain dementia.
"00:16:37,679","00:16:40,316",- I want that. - You can't have the whole brain.
"00:16:40,397","00:16:42,785","So far, you have four. I only have two."
"00:16:42,876","00:16:46,628",OK. Take blood parasites. They're yours.
"00:16:46,714","00:16:48,908",Now we both have three...
"00:16:51,511","00:16:54,070",Hey! You left half your clothes.
"00:17:09,902","00:17:11,971","- What, are you selling those? - Yes!"
"00:17:12,061","00:17:14,051",I'm selling some clothes!
"00:17:14,140","00:17:16,130",So! We each have three. That's six.
"00:17:16,219","00:17:18,936",What about the seventh day? I want ascending bowel cancer.
"00:17:19,017","00:17:21,007",The girl had done her homework.
"00:17:21,096","00:17:23,086",No. No. I want bowel cancer.
"00:17:23,735","00:17:25,725",That's your favourite too?
"00:17:25,814","00:17:29,168","- Tried to slip it by me, eh? - Look, we're gonna split it. OK?"
"00:17:29,252","00:17:31,242",Take the first and third Sunday of the month.
"00:17:33,609","00:17:35,406",Deal.
"00:17:37,887","00:17:40,116",Looks like this is goodbye.
"00:17:40,206","00:17:42,241",Let's not make a big thing out of it. OK?
"00:17:42,325","00:17:44,679",How's this for not making a big thing?
"00:17:48,002","00:17:49,753","Hey, Marla!"
"00:17:50,041","00:17:52,110",Marla!
"00:17:52,200","00:17:54,667",Maybe we should exchange numbers.
"00:17:54,758","00:17:56,589",Should we?
"00:17:56,677","00:18:00,588",- We might wanna switch nights. - OK.
"00:18:05,553","00:18:07,986",This is how I met Marla Singer.
"00:18:09,631","00:18:13,702",Marla's philosophy of life was that she might die at any moment.
"00:18:13,789","00:18:15,982","The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't."
"00:18:16,067","00:18:19,944",It doesn't have your name! Who are you? Cornelius? Rupert?
"00:18:20,025","00:18:23,811",Travis? Any of the stupid names you give each night?
"00:18:26,662","00:18:28,652",You wake up at SeaTac.
"00:18:28,741","00:18:31,572",S.F.O. L.A.X.
"00:18:31,659","00:18:33,933",You wake up at O'Hare.
"00:18:34,018","00:18:36,053",Dallas Fort Worth.
"00:18:36,137","00:18:38,013",B.W.I.
"00:18:38,096","00:18:41,723",Pacific. Mountain. Central. Lose an hour. Gain an hour.
"00:18:41,814","00:18:45,521","The check-in for that flight doesn't begin for another two hours, sir."
"00:18:45,612","00:18:48,761","This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time."
"00:18:48,850","00:18:51,727",You wake up at Air Harbor International.
"00:18:53,088","00:18:56,761","If you wake up at a different time, in a different place,"
"00:18:56,846","00:18:59,405",could you wake up as a different person?
"00:18:59,485","00:19:01,475","Everywhere I travel,"
"00:19:01,564","00:19:03,713",tiny life.
"00:19:03,803","00:19:06,235","Single-serving sugar, single-serving cream."
"00:19:06,321","00:19:08,038",Single pat of butter.
"00:19:08,120","00:19:10,838",The microwave Cordon Bleu hobby kit.
"00:19:10,919","00:19:12,795",Shampoo-conditioner combos.
"00:19:12,878","00:19:16,585",Sample-package mouthwash. Tiny bars of soap.
"00:19:17,995","00:19:20,383","The people I meet on each flight,"
"00:19:20,474","00:19:22,509",they're single-serving friends.
"00:19:22,593","00:19:26,140","Between take off and landing, we have our time together."
"00:19:26,231","00:19:28,380",That's all we get.
"00:19:28,470","00:19:30,300",Welcome!
"00:19:32,308","00:19:36,299","On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero."
"00:19:36,386","00:19:39,979",I was a recall coordinator. My job was to apply the formula.
"00:19:40,064","00:19:42,338",Here's where the infant went through the windshield. Three points.
"00:19:42,423","00:19:46,334",A new car built by my company leaves somewhere travelling at 60mph.
"00:19:46,420","00:19:48,410",The rear differential locks up.
"00:19:49,419","00:19:51,886",The teenager's braces are wrapped around the backseat ashtray.
"00:19:51,978","00:19:54,251",Might make a good anti-smoking ad.
"00:19:54,336","00:19:57,691",The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside.
"00:19:57,775","00:19:59,968","Now, should we initiate a recall?"
"00:20:00,053","00:20:02,043",The father must have been huge.
"00:20:02,132","00:20:05,203",See how the fat burnt into the driver's seat with the polyester shirt?
"00:20:05,291","00:20:07,201",Very modern art.
"00:20:07,290","00:20:09,677","Take the number of vehicles in the field, A."
"00:20:09,768","00:20:12,361","Multiply it by the probable rate of failure, B."
"00:20:12,447","00:20:16,074","Multiply the result by the average out-of-court settlement, C."
"00:20:16,165","00:20:18,155",A x B x C
"00:20:18,364","00:20:20,194",equals X.
"00:20:20,283","00:20:22,750","If X is less than the cost of a recall,"
"00:20:22,842","00:20:24,797",we don't do one.
"00:20:24,880","00:20:27,951",Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?
"00:20:28,039","00:20:29,869",You wouldn't believe.
"00:20:31,277","00:20:33,710",Which car company do you work for?
"00:20:33,796","00:20:35,786",A major one.
"00:20:38,194","00:20:41,946","Every time the plane banked too sharply on takeoff or landing,"
"00:20:42,032","00:20:45,181",I prayed for a crash or a mid-air collision.
"00:20:45,830","00:20:47,308",Anything.
"00:20:55,824","00:20:59,372",Life insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip.
"00:21:02,221","00:21:05,370","""If you are seated in an emergency exit row"", yeah..."
"00:21:05,459","00:21:08,814","""and if you would be unable or unwilling to perform the duties"""
"00:21:08,898","00:21:13,173","listed on the safety card, please ask a flight attendant to reseat you."""
"00:21:14,894","00:21:16,849",It's a lot of responsibility.
"00:21:16,933","00:21:19,048",Wanna switch seats?
"00:21:19,132","00:21:22,441",No. I'm not sure I'm the man for that particular job.
"00:21:22,531","00:21:26,726","An exit-door procedure at 30,000ft. Mm-hmm."
"00:21:26,808","00:21:28,798",The illusion of safety.
"00:21:29,047","00:21:31,037",Yeah. I guess so.
"00:21:31,126","00:21:33,923",You know why they put oxygen masks on planes?
"00:21:34,005","00:21:38,359",- So you can breathe. - Oxygen gets you high.
"00:21:39,442","00:21:42,830","In a catastrophic emergency, you take giant panicked breaths."
"00:21:42,920","00:21:45,308","Suddenly you become euphoric, docile."
"00:21:45,399","00:21:47,592",You accept your fate.
"00:21:48,197","00:21:50,152",It's all right here.
"00:21:50,236","00:21:53,272","Emergency water landing, 600mph."
"00:21:53,354","00:21:56,072",Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.
"00:21:56,153","00:21:58,143",That's...
"00:21:59,311","00:22:01,505",That's an interesting theory.
"00:22:03,429","00:22:05,464",- What do you do? - What do you mean?
"00:22:05,548","00:22:07,538",What do you do for a living?
"00:22:07,627","00:22:10,662",Why? So you can pretend like you are interested?
"00:22:13,224","00:22:14,622",OK.
"00:22:14,703","00:22:17,455",You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.
"00:22:20,580","00:22:22,570",We have the exact same briefcase.
"00:22:23,379","00:22:25,289",Soap.
"00:22:25,378","00:22:28,925",- Sorry? - I make and I sell soap.
"00:22:29,016","00:22:31,290",The yardstick of civilisation.
"00:22:31,814","00:22:33,691",And this is how I met...
"00:22:33,773","00:22:35,525",Tyler Durden.
"00:22:35,613","00:22:40,638","Did you know if you mixed equal parts of gasoline and frozen orange juice concentrate,"
"00:22:40,730","00:22:43,561","- No, I did not know that. Is that true? - That's right."
"00:22:43,648","00:22:47,321",One can make all kinds of explosives using simple household items.
"00:22:47,406","00:22:49,760",- Really? - If one were so inclined.
"00:22:54,523","00:22:59,389","Tyler, you are by far the most interesting single-serving friend I have ever met."
"00:23:01,199","00:23:05,156","- Everything on a plane is single-serving... - Oh, I get it. It's very clever."
"00:23:05,237","00:23:06,715",Thank you.
"00:23:06,796","00:23:08,831",How's it working out for you?
"00:23:08,915","00:23:11,553",- What? - Being clever?
"00:23:11,634","00:23:13,908",Great.
"00:23:13,993","00:23:16,869","Keep it up, then. Right up."
"00:23:17,990","00:23:20,059",Now a question of etiquette.
"00:23:20,149","00:23:23,026","As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?"
"00:23:29,784","00:23:32,013",How I came to live with Tyler is...
"00:23:32,103","00:23:36,174",Airlines have this policy about vibrating luggage.
"00:23:43,577","00:23:48,012","- Was it ticking? - Actually, throwers don't worry about ticking"
"00:23:48,095","00:23:51,130","- Sorry, throwers? - Baggage handlers."
"00:23:51,213","00:23:53,362","But when a suitcase vibrates,"
"00:23:53,452","00:23:56,045",the throwers have got to call the police.
"00:23:56,131","00:23:59,485",- My suitcase was vibrating? - Nine times out of ten
"00:23:59,569","00:24:01,559",it's an electric razor.
"00:24:01,648","00:24:03,683",But... every once in a while
"00:24:06,485","00:24:08,475",it's a dildo.
"00:24:09,204","00:24:13,115","Of course, it's company policy never to imply ownership in the event of a dildo."
"00:24:13,202","00:24:16,909","We have to use the indefinite article, a dildo, never"
"00:24:17,000","00:24:18,990",your dildo.
"00:24:19,079","00:24:21,069",I don't own...
"00:24:23,636","00:24:26,627",I had everything in that suitcase. My C.K. shirts.
"00:24:26,715","00:24:29,750",My D.K.N.Y. shoes. My A.X. ties.
"00:24:31,352","00:24:33,581",Never mind.
"00:24:35,390","00:24:37,983",Hey! That's my car!
"00:24:44,066","00:24:45,942",Home was a condo on the 15th floor
"00:24:46,025","00:24:48,935",of a filing cabinet for widows and young professionals.
"00:24:49,023","00:24:51,536",The walls were solid concrete.
"00:24:51,622","00:24:53,612",A foot of concrete is important
"00:24:53,701","00:24:57,772",when your next-door neighbour lets her hearing aid gonad has to watch games show at full volume.
"00:24:57,859","00:25:01,566",Or when a volcanic blast of debris that used to be your furniture and personal effects
"00:25:01,657","00:25:05,534",blows out of your floor-to-ceiling windows and sails flaming into the night.
"00:25:11,731","00:25:13,925",I suppose these things happen.
"00:25:26,244","00:25:28,234",There's... nothing up there.
"00:25:28,323","00:25:31,552",You can't go into the unit. Police orders.
"00:25:39,877","00:25:42,309",Do you have somebody you can call?
"00:25:42,395","00:25:44,430",How embarrassing.
"00:25:44,514","00:25:47,266",A house full of condiments and no food.
"00:25:56,308","00:25:59,935",The police would later tell me that the pilot light might have gone out
"00:26:00,906","00:26:03,737",letting out just a little bit of gas.
"00:26:03,824","00:26:05,973",That gas could have slowly filled the condo.
"00:26:06,063","00:26:09,451","17-handred square feet with high ceilings, for days and days."
"00:26:17,297","00:26:20,924",Then the refrigerator's compressor could have clicked on.
"00:26:21,975","00:26:23,965",Yeah?
"00:26:26,932","00:26:28,922",I can hear you breathing...
"00:26:37,247","00:26:40,999","If you ask me now, I couldn't tell you why I called him."
"00:27:22,463","00:27:24,578",- Hello? - Who's this?
"00:27:26,741","00:27:28,731",- Tyler? - Who is this?
"00:27:30,219","00:27:32,334",We met... We met on the airplane.
"00:27:32,418","00:27:34,567",We had the same suitcase?
"00:27:34,657","00:27:36,647",The clever guy?
"00:27:36,736","00:27:38,965","Oh, yeah. Right."
"00:27:40,894","00:27:43,453",I called a second ago. There was no answer.
"00:27:43,532","00:27:47,523","- I'm at a payphone. - Yeah, I *69'd you. I never pick up my phone."
"00:27:50,209","00:27:52,199",So what's up?
"00:27:52,848","00:27:54,803",Well.
"00:27:54,887","00:27:56,877",You're not gonna believe this.
"00:27:58,924","00:28:01,039","You know, it could be worse."
"00:28:01,123","00:28:04,716",A woman could cut off your penis while you sleep and toss it out of the window of a moving car.
"00:28:05,561","00:28:08,676",There's always that. I don't know.
"00:28:08,759","00:28:11,750","When you buy furniture, you tell yourself, that's it."
"00:28:11,838","00:28:13,828",That's the last sofa I'm gonna need.
"00:28:13,917","00:28:16,588","Whatever else happens, I've got the sofa problem handled."
"00:28:16,675","00:28:19,984",I had it all. I had a stereo that was very decent.
"00:28:20,073","00:28:23,462",A wardrobe that was getting very respectable.
"00:28:23,552","00:28:25,621",I was close to being complete.
"00:28:25,711","00:28:28,143","- Shit, man. Now it's all gone. - All gone."
"00:28:28,229","00:28:30,867",All gone.
"00:28:32,067","00:28:34,022",Do you know what a duvet is?
"00:28:34,106","00:28:36,858",- A comforter. - It's a blanket.
"00:28:36,945","00:28:40,777",Just a blanket. Why do guys like you and I know what a duvet is?
"00:28:40,863","00:28:44,854",Is this essential to our survival in the hunter-gatherer sense of the word?
"00:28:44,941","00:28:46,498",No.
"00:28:46,580","00:28:48,490","What are we, then?"
"00:28:48,579","00:28:51,045",I don't know. Consumers.
"00:28:51,137","00:28:53,127",Right. We're consumers.
"00:28:53,216","00:28:56,366",We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession.
"00:28:56,455","00:29:00,207","Murder, crime, poverty. These things don't concern me."
"00:29:00,293","00:29:03,567","What concerns me are celebrity magazines,"
"00:29:03,651","00:29:05,641","television with 500 channels,"
"00:29:05,730","00:29:08,288",some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine.
"00:29:08,368","00:29:10,358",Viagra. Olestra.
"00:29:10,447","00:29:13,165",- Martha Stewart. - Fuck Martha Stewart.
"00:29:13,246","00:29:16,600","Martha's polishes on the brass of the Titanic. It's all going down, man."
"00:29:16,684","00:29:20,277",So fuck off with your sofa units and Strinne green stripe patterns.
"00:29:20,362","00:29:23,512",I say never be complete.
"00:29:23,600","00:29:25,555",I say stop being perfect.
"00:29:25,639","00:29:27,594",I say let's evolve.
"00:29:27,678","00:29:29,872",Let the chips fall where they may.
"00:29:31,956","00:29:33,946","But that's me, and I could be wrong."
"00:29:34,035","00:29:36,025",Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
"00:29:36,114","00:29:38,502",It's just stuff. Not a tragedy...
"00:29:38,593","00:29:42,186",You did lose a lot of versatile solutions for modern living.
"00:29:42,271","00:29:44,737","Fuck, you're right. I don't smoke."
"00:29:47,988","00:29:51,581","My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so..."
"00:29:53,945","00:29:55,980",What?
"00:29:56,064","00:29:59,054",The things you own end up owning you.
"00:30:02,260","00:30:04,250","Do what you like, man."
"00:30:04,939","00:30:07,293","Oh, it's late."
"00:30:07,378","00:30:09,970","- Hey, thanks for the beer. - Yeah, man."
"00:30:10,056","00:30:12,046",I should find a hotel.
"00:30:12,775","00:30:14,765",What?
"00:30:14,854","00:30:16,411",What?
"00:30:16,493","00:30:18,483",- A hotel? - Yeah.
"00:30:18,572","00:30:21,528","- Just ask, man. - What are you talking about?"
"00:30:21,610","00:30:25,203","Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer and you still can't ask."
"00:30:26,168","00:30:27,725",What?
"00:30:27,807","00:30:30,366",You called me because you needed a place to stay.
"00:30:30,446","00:30:33,720","- Oh, hey. No, no, no. - Yes, you did. So just ask."
"00:30:33,804","00:30:36,271","Cut the foreplay and just ask, man."
"00:30:38,002","00:30:40,151",Would... Would that be a problem?
"00:30:40,241","00:30:42,231",Is it a problem for you to ask?
"00:30:43,199","00:30:45,348",- Can I stay at your place? - Yeah.
"00:30:46,677","00:30:48,667",Thanks.
"00:30:52,634","00:30:55,511","- I want you to do me a favour. - Yeah, sure."
"00:30:55,593","00:30:57,900",I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
"00:30:57,991","00:30:59,867",What?
"00:30:59,950","00:31:03,623",I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
"00:31:03,708","00:31:06,505",Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.
"00:31:06,707","00:31:08,936",Tyler was a night person.
"00:31:09,026","00:31:11,175","While the rest of us were sleeping, he worked."
"00:31:11,265","00:31:14,300",He had one part-time job as a projectionist.
"00:31:14,383","00:31:17,259",A movie doesn't come all on one big reel. It comes on a few.
"00:31:17,341","00:31:20,889",So someone has to be there to switch the projectors at the exact moment
"00:31:20,979","00:31:24,095",that one reel ends and the next one begins.
"00:31:24,178","00:31:27,930",If you look for it you can see little dots coming into the upper right hand corner of the screen.
"00:31:28,016","00:31:30,608","In the industry, we call them cigarette burns."
"00:31:30,694","00:31:32,684",That's the cue for a changeover.
"00:31:32,773","00:31:37,322","He flips the projectors, movie keeps right on going and nobody in the audience has any idea."
"00:31:37,411","00:31:39,560",Why would anyone want this shitjob?
"00:31:39,650","00:31:42,685",Because it affords him other interesting opportunities.
"00:31:42,768","00:31:46,156",Like splicing single frames of pornography into family films.
"00:31:46,246","00:31:51,034","So when the snooty cat and the courageous dog, with the celebrity voices,"
"00:31:51,124","00:31:55,161",that's when you'll catch a flash of Tyler's contribution in the film.
"00:32:01,758","00:32:04,271",Nobody knows that they saw it but they did.
"00:32:04,357","00:32:06,790","Nice, big cock."
"00:32:11,393","00:32:14,065",Even a hummingbird couldn't catch Tyler at work.
"00:32:19,149","00:32:23,982",Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet waiter at the luxurious Pressman hotel.
"00:32:28,464","00:32:32,341",He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
"00:32:32,422","00:32:34,616",Do not watch. I cannot go when you watch.
"00:32:34,701","00:32:38,931","Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque, he farted on meringues,"
"00:32:39,019","00:32:41,452",and as for the cream of mushroom soup... well...
"00:32:41,538","00:32:43,493","Go ahead, tell 'em."
"00:32:43,577","00:32:45,487",You get the idea.
"00:32:45,695","00:32:48,766","- Well, what do you want me to do? You just want me to hit you?"
"00:32:48,854","00:32:52,083",- Why? - I don't know. Never been in a fight. You?
"00:32:52,172","00:32:56,004","- No. But that's a good thing. -  No, it is not! How much can you know about yourself"
"00:32:56,090","00:32:58,319",I don't wanna die without any scars.
"00:32:58,409","00:33:02,525","- Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve. - Oh, God. This is crazy."
"00:33:02,607","00:33:04,801",So go crazy! Let it rip.
"00:33:04,885","00:33:07,444",- I don't know about this. - I don't either.
"00:33:07,524","00:33:10,481",Who gives a shit? No one's watching. What do you care?
"00:33:10,563","00:33:12,916",This is crazy. You want me to hit you?!
"00:33:13,001","00:33:14,991",That's right.
"00:33:15,080","00:33:18,151","- Where? Like, in the face? - Surprise me."
"00:33:20,237","00:33:22,227",This is so fucking stupid.
"00:33:32,671","00:33:34,740",Motherfucker!
"00:33:34,830","00:33:36,820",He hit me in the ear!
"00:33:36,909","00:33:39,979","- Well, Jesus, I'm sorry. - Ow, Christ!"
"00:33:40,067","00:33:42,057","- Why the ear, man? - I fucked it up."
"00:33:42,146","00:33:43,783","No, that was perfect."
"00:33:56,139","00:33:58,174","No, it's all right."
"00:33:58,977","00:34:00,967",It really hurts.
"00:34:01,416","00:34:03,406",Right.
"00:34:03,735","00:34:05,850",Hit me again.
"00:34:05,934","00:34:07,969","No, you hit me. Come on!"
"00:34:24,204","00:34:26,592",We should do this again sometime.
"00:34:38,877","00:34:40,992",- Where's your car? - What car?
"00:34:51,070","00:34:53,344",I don't know how Tyler found that house
"00:34:53,429","00:34:55,578",but he said he'd been there for a year.
"00:34:55,668","00:34:58,419",It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.
"00:34:58,506","00:35:00,814",Most of the windows were boarded up.
"00:35:00,905","00:35:06,023","There was no lock on the front door from where the police, or whoever, kicked it in."
"00:35:06,102","00:35:08,092",The stairs were ready to collapse.
"00:35:08,181","00:35:10,614",I didn't know if he owned it or he was squatting.
"00:35:10,700","00:35:13,088",Neither would have surprised me.
"00:35:13,938","00:35:15,928",Yep. That's you.
"00:35:16,017","00:35:18,484",That's me. That's the toilet. Good?
"00:35:18,576","00:35:20,566","Yeah, thanks."
"00:35:20,655","00:35:22,485",What a shit hole.
"00:35:22,574","00:35:24,450",Nothing worked.
"00:35:27,931","00:35:31,717",Turning on one light meant another light in the house went out.
"00:35:31,809","00:35:35,402",There were no neighbours. Just some warehouses and a papermill.
"00:35:35,487","00:35:39,319","That fart smell of steam, the hamster cage smell of wood chips."
"00:35:41,004","00:35:43,278",What have we here?
"00:35:57,476","00:35:59,511","- Hey, guys. - Hey."
"00:36:10,029","00:36:12,986","Every time it rained, we had to kill the power."
"00:36:13,827","00:36:17,057","By the end of the first month, I didn't miss TV."
"00:36:18,065","00:36:21,260","I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator."
"00:36:33,137","00:36:35,127",Can I be next?
"00:36:39,374","00:36:41,364","All right, man."
"00:36:41,453","00:36:43,363",Lose the tie.
"00:36:47,210","00:36:51,406","At night, Tyler and I were alone for half a mile in every direction."
"00:36:56,645","00:37:00,397",Rain trickled down through the plaster and the light fixtures.
"00:37:00,483","00:37:03,201",Everything wooden swelled and shrunk.
"00:37:03,282","00:37:06,352",Everywhere were rusted nails to snagy our elbow on.
"00:37:06,440","00:37:08,907",The previous occupant had been a bit of shut-in.
"00:37:08,999","00:37:10,989","Hey, man. What are you reading?"
"00:37:11,078","00:37:15,273",Listen to this. It's an article written by an organ in the first person.
"00:37:15,355","00:37:17,993","""I am Jack's medulla oblongata. Without me,"
"00:37:18,074","00:37:21,382","Jack could not regulate his heart rate, blood pressure or breathing."""
"00:37:21,472","00:37:23,462",There's a whole series of these.
"00:37:23,551","00:37:25,541","""I Am Jill's Nipples."""
"00:37:27,469","00:37:31,301","- ""I Am Jack's Colon."" - ""I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack."""
"00:37:34,425","00:37:38,052","After fighting, everything else in life got the volume turned down."
"00:37:38,143","00:37:41,612",What?
"00:37:41,702","00:37:45,090",You could deal with anything. - Have you finished those reports?
"00:37:49,577","00:37:52,044","If you could fight anyone, who would you fight?"
"00:37:52,136","00:37:54,126","I'd fight my boss, probably."
"00:37:54,215","00:37:56,250",Really?
"00:37:56,334","00:37:59,529","- Yeah, why? Who would you fight? - I'd fight my dad."
"00:37:59,612","00:38:01,602",I don't know my dad.
"00:38:01,691","00:38:03,521","I mean, I know him, but..."
"00:38:03,610","00:38:05,884",He left when I was like six years old.
"00:38:05,969","00:38:08,845",Married this other woman and had some other kids.
"00:38:08,927","00:38:10,917",He did this every six years.
"00:38:11,006","00:38:14,963",- He goes to a new city and starts a new family. - Fucker's setting up franchises!
"00:38:15,764","00:38:17,754",My dad never went to college.
"00:38:17,843","00:38:21,595",- So it was real important that I go. - That sounds familiar.
"00:38:21,681","00:38:25,957","So I graduate. Call him up long-distance and say, ""Dad, now what?"""
"00:38:26,039","00:38:27,949","- He says, ""Get a job."" - Same here."
"00:38:28,038","00:38:30,596",Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.
"00:38:30,676","00:38:32,586","""Dad, now what?"""
"00:38:32,675","00:38:34,710","He says, ""I don't know. Get married."""
"00:38:34,794","00:38:38,102",I can't get married.
"00:38:38,832","00:38:40,822",I'm a 30-year-old boy.
"00:38:40,911","00:38:43,299",We're a generation of men raised by women.
"00:38:43,390","00:38:47,460",I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.
"00:38:53,224","00:38:56,295","Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet."
"00:38:57,142","00:39:00,451","But every Saturday night, we were finding something out."
"00:39:01,620","00:39:04,928",We were finding out more and more that we were not alone.
"00:39:08,696","00:39:13,165","It used to be that when I came home angry or depressed, I'd just clean my condo."
"00:39:13,254","00:39:15,244",Polish my Scandinavian furniture.
"00:39:15,333","00:39:20,165",I should have been looking for a new condo or I should have been
"00:39:20,250","00:39:23,877",I should have been upset about my nice neat flaming little shit.
"00:39:23,968","00:39:25,798",But I wasn't.
"00:39:25,887","00:39:29,401",The basic premise of cyber netting any office is make things more efficient.
"00:39:29,486","00:39:32,203",Monday mornings all I could do was to think about next week.
"00:39:32,284","00:39:35,195",Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?
"00:39:35,283","00:39:36,351",Absolutely.
"00:39:36,442","00:39:39,557","Efficiency is priority No.1, people."
"00:39:39,680","00:39:42,352",Because waste is a thief.
"00:39:42,439","00:39:45,429","I showed this already to my man here. You liked it, didn't you?"
"00:39:48,955","00:39:52,708",You can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick.
"00:39:53,713","00:39:55,862",It was right in everyone's face.
"00:39:55,952","00:39:58,021",Tyler and I just made it visible.
"00:39:58,111","00:40:00,418",It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.
"00:40:00,509","00:40:02,499",Tyler and I just gave it a name.
"00:40:13,263","00:40:15,253","Come on people, you've gotta go home!"
"00:40:36,571","00:40:38,765",Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.
"00:40:58,839","00:41:02,386","Every week, Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided."
"00:41:02,477","00:41:04,467",Gentlemen!
"00:41:05,196","00:41:07,186",Welcome to Fight Club.
"00:41:09,234","00:41:11,303",The first rule of Fight Club is
"00:41:11,393","00:41:13,666",you do not talk about Fight Club.
"00:41:13,751","00:41:16,218",The second rule of Fight Club is
"00:41:16,630","00:41:19,938",you do not talk about Fight Club!
"00:41:20,028","00:41:22,222",Third rule of Fight Club.
"00:41:22,307","00:41:24,979","Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,"
"00:41:25,065","00:41:27,703",the fight is over. Fourth rule.
"00:41:27,784","00:41:30,013",Only two guys to a fight.
"00:41:30,103","00:41:31,899",Fifth rule.
"00:41:31,982","00:41:34,541","One fight at a time, fellas."
"00:41:34,621","00:41:37,008",Sixth rule. No shirts. No shoes.
"00:41:37,099","00:41:40,851",Seventh rule. Fights will go on as long as they have to.
"00:41:42,616","00:41:45,083",And the eighth and final rule.
"00:41:46,175","00:41:49,245",If this is your first night at Fight Club
"00:41:49,333","00:41:51,323",you have to fight.
"00:41:55,210","00:41:57,200","This kid from work, Ricky,"
"00:41:57,289","00:42:01,599",couldn't remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black.
"00:42:01,686","00:42:03,994",But Ricky was a god for ten minutes
"00:42:04,085","00:42:07,281",when he trounced the maitre d' of the local food court.
"00:42:09,083","00:42:14,200","Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat, hard, packing sounds over the yelling."
"00:42:17,798","00:42:20,709",Or the wet choke when someone caught their breath and sprayed...
"00:42:20,797","00:42:22,752",Stop!
"00:42:22,835","00:42:25,587",You weren't alive anywhere like you were there.
"00:42:25,674","00:42:30,268",But Fight Club only exists in the hours between when Fight Club starts and ends.
"00:42:30,791","00:42:33,702","Even if I could tell someone they had a good fight,"
"00:42:33,790","00:42:35,984",I wouldn't be talking to the same man.
"00:42:36,069","00:42:39,264",Who you were in Fight Club is not who you were in the rest of the world.
"00:42:39,347","00:42:44,179",A guy came to Fight Club for the first time. His ass was a wad of cookie dough.
"00:42:44,264","00:42:46,982","After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood."
"00:42:47,783","00:42:50,853","If you could fight any celebrity, who would you fight?"
"00:42:50,941","00:42:53,931",- Alive or dead? - Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?
"00:42:54,819","00:42:57,809",Hemingway. You?
"00:42:58,417","00:43:01,452",Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.
"00:43:02,455","00:43:05,525",We all started seeing things differently.
"00:43:06,733","00:43:09,962","Everywhere we went, we were sizing things up."
"00:43:13,169","00:43:16,160","I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,"
"00:43:16,248","00:43:20,159",trying to look like how Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.
"00:43:20,246","00:43:22,281",Is that what a man looks like?
"00:43:23,164","00:43:25,882","Oh, self-improvement is masturbation."
"00:43:25,963","00:43:27,953","Now, self-destruction..."
"00:43:28,042","00:43:29,952",Excuse me.
"00:44:03,143","00:44:06,214",Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.
"00:44:06,302","00:44:08,292",It wasn't about words.
"00:44:10,140","00:44:13,494",The hysterical shouting was in tongues
"00:44:13,578","00:44:15,454",like at a Pentecostal Church.
"00:44:19,815","00:44:21,805",- Is that it? - Stop!
"00:44:21,894","00:44:24,645","When the fight was over, nothing was solved."
"00:44:24,732","00:44:26,562",But nothing mattered.
"00:44:26,651","00:44:29,323",Cool.
"00:44:29,410","00:44:32,081","Afterwards, we all felt saved."
"00:44:32,968","00:44:35,162","Hey, man. How about next week?"
"00:44:35,247","00:44:37,237",How about next month?!
"00:44:37,326","00:44:39,316","Irvine, you're in the middle."
"00:44:39,404","00:44:41,359","New guy, you too."
"00:44:43,043","00:44:45,112","Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me."
"00:44:45,201","00:44:47,191",He fell down some stairs.
"00:44:47,840","00:44:49,830",I fell down some stairs.
"00:44:51,598","00:44:56,067",Fight Club became the reason to cut your hair short or trim your fingernails.
"00:44:56,156","00:44:58,544",OK. Any historical figure.
"00:44:58,634","00:45:00,431",I'd fight Gandhi.
"00:45:01,033","00:45:02,784",Good answer.
"00:45:02,872","00:45:05,021",- How about you? - Lincoln.
"00:45:05,111","00:45:07,578",Lincoln?
"00:45:07,670","00:45:11,138","Big guy, big reach. Skinny guys fight till they're burger."
"00:45:11,988","00:45:13,978",Fuck!
"00:45:15,106","00:45:17,699","Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart."
"00:45:26,420","00:45:27,738",Hello?
"00:45:27,819","00:45:30,127",Where have you been the last eight weeks?
"00:45:30,218","00:45:31,445",Marla?
"00:45:34,296","00:45:37,331",- How did you find me? - You left that forwarding number.
"00:45:37,414","00:45:40,291",I haven't seen you at any support groups.
"00:45:40,373","00:45:43,443",We split'em up. That was the idea. Remember?
"00:45:43,531","00:45:46,249","Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours."
"00:45:46,330","00:45:49,684",- How do you know? - I cheated.
"00:45:49,768","00:45:51,519",I found a new one.
"00:45:52,047","00:45:54,241",- Really? - It's for men only.
"00:45:54,326","00:45:55,838",Like the testicle thing?
"00:45:59,443","00:46:01,398","Look, this is a bad time."
"00:46:01,482","00:46:03,836",I've been going to Debtor's Anonymous.
"00:46:03,921","00:46:07,309",- You want to see some really fucked up people? - I'm just on my way out.
"00:46:07,399","00:46:09,673",Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.
"00:46:09,758","00:46:11,951",I took what was left of a bottle.
"00:46:12,036","00:46:14,026",It might have been too much.
"00:46:14,115","00:46:17,583",Just picture watching Marla Singer throwing herself around her crummy apartment.
"00:46:17,713","00:46:22,023",This isn't a for-real-suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for-help thing.
"00:46:22,111","00:46:24,908","This could go on for hours. - So you're staying in tonight, then?"
"00:46:24,990","00:46:27,707","Do you wanna wait, and hear me describe death?"
"00:46:27,788","00:46:32,098",Do you wanna listen and see if my spirit can use a phone?
"00:46:34,265","00:46:36,823",Have you ever heard a death rattle before?
"00:47:02,010","00:47:06,638",Tyler's door was closed. I'd been living here for two months and Tyler's door was never closed.
"00:47:11,445","00:47:14,402",You won't believe this dream I had last night.
"00:47:14,484","00:47:17,633",I can hardly believe anything about last night.
"00:47:27,037","00:47:28,913",What are you doing here?
"00:47:31,515","00:47:33,505",What?
"00:47:33,594","00:47:35,948",This is my house. What are you doing in my house?
"00:47:38,232","00:47:40,142",Fuck you!
"00:47:54,183","00:47:57,379","Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends! I'm telling you!"
"00:47:57,462","00:47:59,372","Limber, though."
"00:47:59,461","00:48:01,371",Silly coos.
"00:48:02,419","00:48:05,012","So, I come in last night. Phone's off the hook."
"00:48:05,098","00:48:07,088",Guess who's on the other end?
"00:48:07,177","00:48:09,291",I already knew the story before he told it to me.
"00:48:11,494","00:48:14,928",Have you ever heard a death rattle before?
"00:48:15,012","00:48:17,730",Do you think it'll live up to its name?
"00:48:17,811","00:48:21,245",Or will it just be a death hairball?
"00:48:24,527","00:48:28,359",Prepare to evacuate soul.
"00:48:28,445","00:48:30,003","Ten,"
"00:48:30,085","00:48:32,756","nine,... eight..."
"00:48:32,843","00:48:34,992","How could Tyler, of all people,"
"00:48:35,082","00:48:38,789",think it was a bad thing that Marla Singer was about to die?
"00:48:38,880","00:48:40,437","Five,"
"00:48:40,519","00:48:42,076",four...
"00:48:42,798","00:48:44,788",Hang on.
"00:48:49,994","00:48:52,223",You got here fast.
"00:48:53,712","00:48:55,702",Did I call you?
"00:49:05,986","00:49:08,976",The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic.
"00:49:12,063","00:49:14,371","Oh, don't worry. It's not a threat to you."
"00:49:17,060","00:49:18,856","Oh, fuck!"
"00:49:18,939","00:49:20,929",Somebody called the cops.
"00:49:32,372","00:49:35,726","- Hey, where's 513? - End of the hall."
"00:49:36,490","00:49:40,197","The girl who lives there used to be a charming, lovely girl."
"00:49:40,288","00:49:42,357",She has lost faith in herself.
"00:49:42,447","00:49:45,165","- Miss Singer, let us help you! - She's a monster!"
"00:49:45,246","00:49:49,202",- You have every reason to live. - She's infectious human waste!
"00:49:49,283","00:49:52,911",- Miss Singer! - Good luck trying to save her!
"00:49:57,519","00:49:59,634","If I fall asleep,"
"00:49:59,718","00:50:01,867",I'm done for.
"00:50:03,756","00:50:05,871",You're gonna have to keep me up
"00:50:05,955","00:50:07,945",all night.
"00:50:08,034","00:50:10,263",Un-fucking-believable.
"00:50:10,352","00:50:12,421",He was obviously able to handle it.
"00:50:12,511","00:50:16,059","- You know what I mean, you fucked her. - No, I didn't."
"00:50:16,149","00:50:18,139",- Never? - No.
"00:50:19,068","00:50:21,058","You're not into her, are you?"
"00:50:21,147","00:50:23,137","No! God, not at all."
"00:50:23,226","00:50:25,738",I am Jack's raging bile duct.
"00:50:25,824","00:50:27,700",Are you sure? You can tell me.
"00:50:27,783","00:50:29,579","Believe me, I'm sure."
"00:50:29,662","00:50:32,812",- Put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brains.
"00:50:32,901","00:50:35,538",She's a predator posing as a house pet. Stay away from that one.
"00:50:37,418","00:50:40,932","The shit that came out of this woman's mouth, I had never heard!"
"00:50:41,017","00:50:42,608",My God.
"00:50:42,696","00:50:45,925",I haven't been fucked like that since grade school.
"00:50:46,014","00:50:48,368",How could Tyler not go for that?
"00:50:48,453","00:50:51,841","The night before last, he was splicing sex organs into ""Cinderella""."
"00:50:51,931","00:50:54,602","Marla doesn't need a lover, just a fucking case worker."
"00:50:54,689","00:50:57,202",She needs a wash. And she's in love with sport-fucking.
"00:50:57,288","00:51:00,040",She invaded my support groups and now she'd invaded my home.
"00:51:00,127","00:51:02,117","Hey, hey. Sit down."
"00:51:06,044","00:51:09,318","Now, listen. I can't have you talking to her about me."
"00:51:09,402","00:51:11,153",Why would I...
"00:51:11,241","00:51:16,392","Say anything about me or what goes on in this house to her or anybody,... we're done."
"00:51:16,478","00:51:19,037",- Now promise me. - OK.
"00:51:19,117","00:51:21,152","- Yeah, I promise. - Promise?"
"00:51:21,236","00:51:24,465","- I just said, I promise! What... - That's three times you promised."
"00:51:25,913","00:51:29,745","If only I had wasted a couple of minutes and gone to watch Marla Singer die,"
"00:51:29,831","00:51:31,821",none of this would have happened.
"00:51:36,548","00:51:39,344","Harder, yes! Oh, harder, harder!"
"00:51:45,663","00:51:48,051",I could have moved to another room.
"00:51:49,141","00:51:52,814",On the third floor where I might not have heard them.
"00:51:52,899","00:51:54,889",But I didn't.
"00:52:18,086","00:52:22,043",- What are you doing? - Just going to bed.
"00:52:22,124","00:52:24,114",Wanna finish her off?
"00:52:26,882","00:52:30,316","- No. No, thank you. - I've found a cigarette."
"00:52:30,400","00:52:33,595",- Who were you talking to? - Shut up.
"00:52:33,678","00:52:36,827",I became the calm little centre of the world.
"00:52:37,436","00:52:39,426",I was the Zen master.
"00:52:44,352","00:52:46,262",I wrote little haiku poems.
"00:52:46,871","00:52:49,100",I e-mailed them to everyone.
"00:52:49,190","00:52:51,225",Is that your blood?
"00:52:52,828","00:52:54,818","Some of it, yeah."
"00:52:54,907","00:52:57,466",You can't smoke in here.
"00:52:57,546","00:52:59,536",Take the rest of the day off.
"00:52:59,625","00:53:02,057",Come back Monday with some clean clothes.
"00:53:02,143","00:53:04,133",Get yourself together.
"00:53:04,502","00:53:06,776",I got right in everyone's hostile little face.
"00:53:06,861","00:53:09,249","""Yes, these are my bruises from fighting."""
"00:53:09,339","00:53:11,329","""Yes, I'm comfortable with that."""
"00:53:11,418","00:53:13,214","""I am enlightened."""
"00:53:15,056","00:53:20,003","You give up the condo life, give up all your flaming worldly possessions,"
"00:53:20,094","00:53:23,050","go live in a delapidated house in the toxic waste part of town,"
"00:53:23,132","00:53:26,839",and you have to come home to this.
"00:53:37,045","00:53:40,319",- Hello. - This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.
"00:53:40,403","00:53:44,440",We have some new information about the incident at your former condo.
"00:53:44,521","00:53:45,749",Yes.
"00:53:45,840","00:53:50,548","I don't know if you're aware, but it seems that someone sprayed freon into your front door lock."
"00:53:50,638","00:53:53,197",Then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
"00:53:53,277","00:53:55,187","No, I wasn't aware of that at all."
"00:53:55,276","00:53:57,186",I am Jack's cold sweat.
"00:53:57,275","00:53:59,468",Does this sound strange to you?
"00:53:59,553","00:54:02,271","Yes, sir, strange. Very strange."
"00:54:02,352","00:54:04,307",- The dynamite... - Dynamite?
"00:54:04,391","00:54:07,381",left a residue of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.
"00:54:07,469","00:54:10,778","- Do you know what this means? - No, what does it mean?"
"00:54:10,867","00:54:12,698",It means it was homemade.
"00:54:12,786","00:54:16,857","I'm sorry. This is just coming as quite a shock to me, sir."
"00:54:16,944","00:54:22,255",Whoever set this dynamite could have blown out your pilot light days before the actual explosion.
"00:54:22,342","00:54:25,298",- The gas was just a detonator. - Who could've done such a thing?
"00:54:25,380","00:54:27,370",- I'll ask the questions. - Tell him.
"00:54:27,499","00:54:31,695",Tell him the liberator who destroyed my property realigned my perception.
"00:54:31,777","00:54:33,767",Excuse me. Are you there?
"00:54:33,856","00:54:36,652",I am listening. It's little hard to know what to make of all this.
"00:54:36,734","00:54:41,010",Have you recently made enemies with anyone who might have access to homemade dynamite?
"00:54:41,092","00:54:43,286","- Enemies? - I reject the basic assumptions of civilization,"
"00:54:43,371","00:54:45,361",especially the importance of material possessions.
"00:54:45,450","00:54:48,201","- Son, this is serious. - Yes, I know it's serious."
"00:54:48,288","00:54:50,755","- I mean that. - Yes, it's very serious."
"00:54:50,847","00:54:53,564","Look, nobody takes this more seriously than me."
"00:54:53,645","00:54:56,283",That condo was my life. OK?
"00:54:56,364","00:54:59,752",I loved every stick of furniture in that place.
"00:54:59,842","00:55:02,753",That was not just a bunch of stuff that got destroyed.
"00:55:02,840","00:55:05,592",- It was me! I'd like to thank the Academy.
"00:55:05,679","00:55:09,556",- Is this not a good time for you? - Just tell him you fucking did it!
"00:55:09,637","00:55:13,344",Tell him you blew it all up! That's what he wants to hear.
"00:55:13,435","00:55:18,109",- Are you still there? - Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?
"00:55:18,192","00:55:22,024","No, no. I may need to talk to you a little futher, so how about you just"
"00:55:22,110","00:55:24,384",- OK? - OK.
"00:55:26,988","00:55:31,423","Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room."
"00:55:31,506","00:55:34,462",My parents pulled this exact same act for years.
"00:55:34,544","00:55:38,137",The condom is the glass slipper of our generation.
"00:55:38,222","00:55:41,019",You slip one on when you meet a stranger.
"00:55:41,101","00:55:43,091",You... dance all night.
"00:55:43,180","00:55:45,169",Then you throw it away.
"00:55:45,378","00:55:47,937","The condom, I mean. Not the stranger."
"00:55:49,376","00:55:50,809",What?
"00:55:55,453","00:55:58,125",I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.
"00:55:58,212","00:56:00,008",It was worth every penny.
"00:56:00,091","00:56:02,081",It's a brides maid's dress.
"00:56:03,009","00:56:06,080",Someone loved it intensely
"00:56:06,168","00:56:08,123",for one day.
"00:56:08,206","00:56:10,196",Then tossed it.
"00:56:12,005","00:56:13,994",Like a Christmas tree.
"00:56:14,083","00:56:16,118",So special.
"00:56:16,202","00:56:17,601",Then
"00:56:17,682","00:56:19,399",bam!
"00:56:19,481","00:56:21,471",It's on the side of the road.
"00:56:21,999","00:56:24,034",Tinsel still clinging to it.
"00:56:25,997","00:56:27,987",Like a sex crime victim.
"00:56:28,076","00:56:30,066",Underwear inside out.
"00:56:30,715","00:56:34,388","- Bound with electrical tape. - Well then, it suits you."
"00:56:34,473","00:56:37,065",You can borrow it sometime.
"00:56:43,788","00:56:45,778",Get rid of her.
"00:56:46,547","00:56:49,343",- What? Why can't you get rid of her? - Don't mention me.
"00:56:49,425","00:56:53,416","I am six years old again, passing messages between parents."
"00:56:55,342","00:56:58,810","- I really think it's time you got out of here. - Don't worry, I'm leaving."
"00:56:58,900","00:57:03,335",- Not that we don't love your visits. - You are such a nutcase. I can't even begin to keep up.
"00:57:05,417","00:57:08,168",Gotta get off
"00:57:08,255","00:57:09,483",Thanks. Bye.
"00:57:09,575","00:57:15,283",Gotta get off of this merry-go-round
"00:57:16,011","00:57:19,684","Gonna get, need to get..."
"00:57:19,769","00:57:21,724",Gotta get...
"00:57:23,847","00:57:25,199",You kids!
"00:57:27,125","00:57:29,513",Why do you still waste time with her?
"00:57:29,604","00:57:31,798",I'll say this about Marla.
"00:57:31,883","00:57:34,077",At least she's trying to hit bottom.
"00:57:34,162","00:57:35,435",And I'm not?
"00:57:35,521","00:57:38,239",Sticking feathers up your butt do not make you a chicken.
"00:57:38,320","00:57:40,310",What are we doing tonight?
"00:57:40,958","00:57:43,107",Tonight... we make soap.
"00:57:44,037","00:57:45,105",Really?
"00:57:45,196","00:57:47,948","To make soap, first we render fat."
"00:58:06,025","00:58:08,174",The salt balance has to be just right
"00:58:08,264","00:58:10,697","so the best fat for making soap, comes from humans."
"00:58:11,462","00:58:14,419","- Wait, what is this place? - A liposuction clinic."
"00:58:22,177","00:58:24,132",Pay dirt!
"00:58:24,216","00:58:27,889","Richest, creamiest fat in the world. Fat of the land!"
"00:58:33,251","00:58:36,685","No! Don't pull it, don't pull it!"
"00:58:41,087","00:58:43,281","- Oh, God! - Give me another one."
"00:58:49,163","00:58:52,471","As the fat renders, the tallows float to the surface."
"00:58:52,561","00:58:54,551",Like in Boy Scouts.
"00:58:54,640","00:58:58,267",- It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout. - Keep stirring.
"00:59:00,517","00:59:03,905","Once the tallow hardens, you skim off a layer of glycerin."
"00:59:03,995","00:59:06,303","If you were to add nitric acid, you got nitroglycerin."
"00:59:06,394","00:59:10,067","If you were to add sodium nitrate and dash of sawdust, you got dynamite."
"00:59:10,152","00:59:13,825","Yeah, with enough soap, we could blow just about anything."
"00:59:13,910","00:59:15,900",Tyler was full of useful information.
"00:59:15,989","00:59:19,775","Now, ancient people found their clothes got cleaner if they washed"
"00:59:19,867","00:59:21,857",- You know why? - No.
"00:59:24,544","00:59:28,172",Human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river.
"00:59:28,263","00:59:31,333",Bodies burnt. Water speeded through the wood ashes to create lye.
"00:59:31,421","00:59:33,729",This is lye. The crucial ingredient.
"00:59:33,820","00:59:38,413","Once it mixed with the melted fat of bodies, a white soapy discharge crept into the river."
"00:59:38,497","00:59:40,487","May I see your hand, please?"
"00:59:45,653","00:59:48,769",What is this?
"00:59:48,852","00:59:51,319",This is a chemical burn.
"00:59:51,410","00:59:54,765",It will hurt more than you've ever been burned and you will have a scar.
"00:59:54,849","00:59:57,407","If guided meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this."
"00:59:58,167","01:00:00,805","- Stay with the pain. Don't shut this out. - Oh, God!"
"01:00:01,565","01:00:05,841","The first soap was made from ashes of heroes, like the first monkey shot into space."
"01:00:05,923","01:00:08,799","Without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothing."
"01:00:08,881","01:00:11,678","I tried not to think of the word ""searing"" of ""flesh""."
"01:00:11,760","01:00:14,795","Stop it! This is your pain, this is your burning hand."
"01:00:14,878","01:00:17,437",I'm going to my cave. I'm going to my cave to find my power animal.
"01:00:17,517","01:00:21,394",No! Don't deal with this the way those dead people do! Come on!
"01:00:21,475","01:00:25,307",- I get the point! - No! You're feeling is premature enlightenment.
"01:00:27,991","01:00:31,902","It's the greatest moment of your life, man, and you're off somewhere missing!"
"01:00:31,989","01:00:33,422",I am not!
"01:00:33,509","01:00:36,385",Shut up! Our fathers were our models for God.
"01:00:36,467","01:00:39,502","If our fathers bailed, what does that tell you about God?"
"01:00:40,465","01:00:45,490",Listen to me. You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you.
"01:00:45,582","01:00:49,493","He never wanted you. In all probability, He hates you."
"01:00:49,580","01:00:53,014",This is not the worst thing that can happen. We don't need Him!
"01:00:53,098","01:00:55,930","- We don't, I agree! - Fuck damnation, man, fuck redemption."
"01:00:56,017","01:00:58,405",We are God's unwanted children? So be it!
"01:00:58,496","01:01:02,805","- I'm getting water! - Listen, you can run water over your hand"
"01:01:03,893","01:01:07,281",- Or you can use vinegar to neutralise the burn. - Please let me out!
"01:01:07,371","01:01:09,361","First, you have to give up."
"01:01:09,450","01:01:12,043","First, you have to know, not fear,"
"01:01:12,129","01:01:15,005","know that some day, you're gonna die."
"01:01:15,087","01:01:17,202",You don't know how this feels!
"01:01:21,004","01:01:25,120",It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.
"01:01:27,041","01:01:29,031",OK.
"01:01:41,753","01:01:43,708",Congratulations.
"01:01:43,792","01:01:46,589",You're one step closer to hitting the bottom.
"01:01:49,509","01:01:52,420",Tyler sold his soap to department stores at $20 a bar.
"01:01:52,508","01:01:54,418",God knows what they charged.
"01:01:54,507","01:01:57,577","- This is the best soap. - Why, thank you, Susan."
"01:01:57,665","01:01:59,655",It was beautiful.
"01:01:59,744","01:02:03,451",We were selling rich women their own fat asses back to them.
"01:02:04,421","01:02:06,411",He was wearing his yellow tie.
"01:02:06,500","01:02:08,694",I didn't even wear a tie to work anymore.
"01:02:08,779","01:02:12,247","""The first rule of Fight Club is you don't talk about Fight Club."""
"01:02:12,337","01:02:15,725",I'm half-asleep again. I must've left the original in the copy machine.
"01:02:15,815","01:02:18,203","""The second rule of Fight Club..."" Is this yours?"
"01:02:20,013","01:02:23,401",Pretend you're me. Make a managerial decision.
"01:02:23,491","01:02:25,845",You find this. What would you do?
"01:02:30,288","01:02:32,198","Well, I gotta tell you,"
"01:02:32,287","01:02:35,800","I'd be very, very careful who you talk to about that."
"01:02:35,885","01:02:39,034",Because the person who wrote that is dangerous.
"01:02:39,123","01:02:43,433","And this button-down, Oxford-cloth psycho might just snap"
"01:02:43,521","01:02:46,273",and then stalk from office to office
"01:02:46,360","01:02:51,192","with an Armalite AR10 carbine gas-powered semiautomatic weapon,"
"01:02:51,277","01:02:55,553",pumping round after round into colleagues and co-workers.
"01:02:56,194","01:02:59,424",This might be someone you've known for years.
"01:02:59,513","01:03:02,503","Someone very, very close to you."
"01:03:02,591","01:03:05,820",Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.
"01:03:06,789","01:03:08,779",And I used to be such a nice guy.
"01:03:08,868","01:03:12,063",Or maybe you shouldn't bring me every little piece of trash you happen to pick up.
"01:03:15,744","01:03:19,257",- Compliance and Liability. - My tit's gonna rot off.
"01:03:20,142","01:03:22,609",Will you excuse me? I need to take this.
"01:03:28,618","01:03:32,131",- What are you talking about? - I need you to check if there's a lump in my breast.
"01:03:32,216","01:03:36,002",- Go to hospital. - I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
"01:03:36,933","01:03:39,048","I don't know about this, Marla."
"01:03:39,132","01:03:40,769",Please.
"01:03:40,851","01:03:44,683",She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutral in her book.
"01:03:46,648","01:03:50,525",That's nice. Taking food to Mrs Haniver and Mrs Raines.
"01:03:50,606","01:03:52,596","Where are they, exactly?"
"01:03:52,685","01:03:56,642","Tragically, they're dead. I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?"
"01:03:56,723","01:03:58,713","- No, no. - I got one for you."
"01:03:58,802","01:04:00,792",Thanks for the thought.
"01:04:02,120","01:04:04,314",What happened to your hand?
"01:04:04,399","01:04:06,468","Oh, nothing."
"01:04:06,558","01:04:08,548",Right there?
"01:04:09,556","01:04:12,115",- Feel anything? - No.
"01:04:12,235","01:04:14,145","Well, make sure."
"01:04:14,234","01:04:16,189","OK, I'm pretty sure."
"01:04:16,273","01:04:18,183",You feel nothing?
"01:04:18,272","01:04:20,466","No, nothing."
"01:04:21,950","01:04:24,667","Well, that's a relief. Thank you."
"01:04:26,188","01:04:29,258",- No problem. - I wish I could return the favour.
"01:04:29,346","01:04:31,336","Well, there's not a lot breast cancer in the men of my family."
"01:04:31,425","01:04:34,779",- I could check your prostate. - I think I'm OK.
"01:04:34,863","01:04:36,853","Well, thanks, anyway."
"01:04:41,660","01:04:43,888","- Are we done? - Yeah, we're done."
"01:04:43,978","01:04:46,093",See you... around.
"01:05:02,513","01:05:04,503",Cornelius?
"01:05:04,592","01:05:06,866",Cornelius!
"01:05:06,950","01:05:09,543",It's me! Bob!
"01:05:09,629","01:05:11,027","Hey, Bob."
"01:05:14,427","01:05:17,303","- We all thought you were dead. - No, no. Still here."
"01:05:17,385","01:05:21,262","- How are you, Bob? - Better than I've ever been in my whole life."
"01:05:21,343","01:05:24,697","- Really? Still remaining men together? - No, no."
"01:05:24,781","01:05:28,408","- I got something so much better now. - Really, what is it?"
"01:05:29,019","01:05:30,815",Well...
"01:05:30,898","01:05:34,969","The first rule is, I'm not supposed to talk about it."
"01:05:35,096","01:05:37,086",And the second rule is
"01:05:37,175","01:05:39,369",I'm not supposed to talk about it.
"01:05:39,454","01:05:42,762","- And the third rule is... - Bob, Bob. I'm a member."
"01:05:42,852","01:05:44,842","Look at my face, Bob."
"01:05:47,170","01:05:49,398",That's fucking... fucking great.
"01:05:49,488","01:05:53,036",- I've never seen you there. - I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.
"01:05:53,126","01:05:56,674",- I go Saturday. - Congratulations.
"01:05:57,084","01:05:59,313","Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?"
"01:05:59,403","01:06:01,962",Have you heard about the guy who invented this thing?
"01:06:02,042","01:06:04,838","- Yeah, actually... - I hear all kinds of things."
"01:06:04,920","01:06:08,389","Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution"
"01:06:08,479","01:06:11,708",and he sleeps only one hour a night.
"01:06:11,797","01:06:13,912",He's a great man.
"01:06:15,355","01:06:17,549",Do you know about Tyler Durden?
"01:06:41,501","01:06:43,491","I didn't hurt you, did I?"
"01:06:43,580","01:06:45,570","Actually, you did."
"01:06:45,659","01:06:47,649",Thank you for this.
"01:06:47,898","01:06:50,172","Thank you, thank you, thank you."
"01:06:50,257","01:06:52,247",Fight Club.
"01:06:52,336","01:06:54,371",This was mine and Tyler's gift.
"01:06:54,455","01:06:54,495",Our gift to the world.
"01:06:54,495","01:06:56,450",Our gift to the world.
"01:06:56,534","01:06:59,729","I look around, I look around, I see a lot of new faces."
"01:07:01,291","01:07:03,406",Shut up!
"01:07:03,490","01:07:08,163",Which means a lot of people have been breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.
"01:07:16,123","01:07:20,034",I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived.
"01:07:20,121","01:07:22,111",I see all this potential.
"01:07:22,200","01:07:24,190",And I see it squandered.
"01:07:25,159","01:07:28,149","Goddamn it, an entire generation pumping gas."
"01:07:28,677","01:07:30,667",Waiting tables.
"01:07:30,756","01:07:32,746",Slaves with white collars.
"01:07:35,113","01:07:38,070","Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes,"
"01:07:38,152","01:07:41,301",working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need.
"01:07:45,028","01:07:47,382",We're the middle children of history.
"01:07:47,467","01:07:49,457",No purpose or place.
"01:07:49,626","01:07:51,616",We have no Great War.
"01:07:51,945","01:07:53,935",No Great Depression.
"01:07:55,623","01:07:57,897",Our great war is a spiritual war.
"01:07:58,301","01:08:01,531",Our great depression is our lives.
"01:08:04,258","01:08:07,215",We've all been raised on television to believe
"01:08:07,297","01:08:10,810",that one day we'd be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars.
"01:08:10,895","01:08:12,885",But we won't.
"01:08:12,974","01:08:15,328",We're slowly learning that fact.
"01:08:15,413","01:08:17,766","And we're very, very pissed off."
"01:08:17,851","01:08:19,408",Yeah!
"01:08:22,209","01:08:26,485","First rule of Fight Club is, you do not talk..."
"01:08:31,724","01:08:32,951",Who are you?
"01:08:33,763","01:08:36,276",- Who am I? - Yeah.
"01:08:37,121","01:08:39,839",There's a sign on the front that says Lou's Tavern.
"01:08:40,879","01:08:44,586",I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?
"01:08:44,677","01:08:46,667",Tyler Durden.
"01:08:49,675","01:08:52,983",Who told you motherfuckers that you could use my place?
"01:08:53,073","01:08:55,347",We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
"01:08:55,432","01:08:57,898",Irvine? Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
"01:08:57,990","01:09:00,059",He don't own this place. I do.
"01:09:02,148","01:09:05,457",- How much money's he getting for this? - There is no money.
"01:09:05,546","01:09:08,218",- Really? - Free to all.
"01:09:08,305","01:09:10,056","It is, actually."
"01:09:10,144","01:09:12,498","Look, stupid fuck!"
"01:09:12,583","01:09:15,016",- I want everybody out of here right now. - Hey!
"01:09:15,102","01:09:17,250",You should join our club.
"01:09:17,620","01:09:19,530",Did you hear what I just said?
"01:09:19,619","01:09:21,609",You and your friend.
"01:09:23,457","01:09:25,447",You hear me now?
"01:09:27,575","01:09:29,565","No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou."
"01:09:35,451","01:09:37,361",Still not getting it.
"01:09:38,369","01:09:40,438","OK, OK, I got it."
"01:09:40,528","01:09:42,882","I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it."
"01:09:43,887","01:09:45,683",Back! All of you!
"01:09:47,325","01:09:49,315",Everybody back!
"01:09:56,480","01:09:58,549","Ah, Lou!"
"01:09:58,639","01:10:02,152","Come on, man! We really like this place."
"01:10:10,833","01:10:13,629","- That's right, Lou. Get it out. - Shut the fuck up."
"01:10:13,751","01:10:15,468","Oh, yeah!"
"01:10:20,228","01:10:22,218",Is that fucking funny?
"01:10:31,422","01:10:33,889","Fucking guy is a loony, I'm telling you."
"01:10:34,700","01:10:36,337",Unbelievable.
"01:10:40,377","01:10:43,209","- You don't know where I've been, Lou. - Oh, my God!"
"01:10:43,296","01:10:46,047",You don't know where I've been!
"01:10:49,013","01:10:51,969","Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!"
"01:10:52,051","01:10:54,405",Fucking use the basement! Christ!
"01:10:54,490","01:10:57,241","I want your word, Lou! I want your word!"
"01:10:57,328","01:10:59,238",On my mother's eyes.
"01:11:08,003","01:11:09,993","Thanks, Lou."
"01:11:11,281","01:11:13,271","You too, big guy."
"01:11:17,078","01:11:19,068",We'll see you next week.
"01:11:33,949","01:11:37,384","This week, each one of you has a homework assignment."
"01:11:37,468","01:11:42,095",You're gonna go out. You're gonna start a fight with a total stranger.
"01:11:45,223","01:11:47,292",You're gonna start a fight
"01:11:47,382","01:11:49,372",and you're gonna lose.
"01:11:51,140","01:11:51,180","Excellent choice, sir."
"01:11:51,180","01:11:53,135","Excellent choice, sir."
"01:11:55,618","01:11:58,767","Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!"
"01:11:59,136","01:12:01,695","Now, this is not as easy as it sounds."
"01:12:04,294","01:12:06,170",Son of a bitch!
"01:12:06,253","01:12:10,801","Most people, normal people, do just about anything to avoid a fight."
"01:12:11,690","01:12:13,680",Excuse me!
"01:12:13,769","01:12:17,316",You sprayed me with your hose. That's not necessary...
"01:12:17,407","01:12:19,237",Jay! Go call 911!
"01:12:21,884","01:12:23,839",Put the hose down.
"01:12:23,923","01:12:25,913",Stop it! Stop it!
"01:12:27,521","01:12:29,318",Sorry.
"01:12:44,193","01:12:46,547",We need to talk.
"01:12:48,710","01:12:50,700",OK.
"01:12:50,789","01:12:52,779",Where to begin?
"01:12:52,868","01:12:54,983",With your constant absenteeism?
"01:12:55,067","01:12:57,500",With your unpresentable appearance?
"01:12:57,586","01:12:59,541",You're up for review.
"01:12:59,625","01:13:02,695",I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.
"01:13:02,783","01:13:04,613",- What? - Let's pretend.
"01:13:04,702","01:13:07,454","You're the Department of Transportation, OK?"
"01:13:07,541","01:13:11,054",Someone informs you that this company
"01:13:11,139","01:13:15,050","installs front-seat mounting brackets that naver pass collision tests,"
"01:13:15,137","01:13:18,411","brake linings that fail after a thousand miles,"
"01:13:18,495","01:13:22,725",and fuel injectors that explode and burn people alive.
"01:13:22,813","01:13:24,609",What then?
"01:13:24,692","01:13:26,886",Are you threatening me?
"01:13:26,971","01:13:29,642",- No... - Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!
"01:13:29,729","01:13:33,959",I have a better solution. You keep me on the payroll as an outside consultant.
"01:13:34,047","01:13:36,037","In exchange for my salary,"
"01:13:36,126","01:13:39,799",my job will be never to tell people these things that I know.
"01:13:39,884","01:13:44,000",I don't even have to come into the office. I can do this job from home.
"01:13:45,241","01:13:49,198","Who... Who the fuck do you think you are, you crazy little shit?"
"01:13:54,236","01:13:57,625",- Security! I am Jack's smirking revenge.
"01:14:06,230","01:14:08,265",What the hell are you doing?
"01:14:17,065","01:14:19,055",That hurt.
"01:14:20,463","01:14:22,453",Why would you do that?
"01:14:23,061","01:14:25,938","Oh, my God! No! Please stop!"
"01:14:34,935","01:14:36,925",What are you doing?
"01:14:37,974","01:14:39,964","Oh, God, no! Please! No!"
"01:14:40,053","01:14:43,964","For some reason, I thought of my first fight, with Tyler."
"01:14:44,051","01:14:45,608",No!
"01:15:08,998","01:15:13,307","Under and behind and inside everything this man took for granted,"
"01:15:13,395","01:15:16,704",something horrible had been growing.
"01:15:16,794","01:15:17,828",Look.
"01:15:17,913","01:15:22,427","Give me the paychecks, like I asked, and you won't ever see me again."
"01:15:22,511","01:15:25,182","And right then, at our most excellent moment together..."
"01:15:28,108","01:15:30,779",Thank God! Please don't hit me again.
"01:15:30,866","01:15:32,856","Telephone, computer,"
"01:15:32,945","01:15:37,892","fax machine, 52 weekly paychecks and 48 airline flight coupons."
"01:15:37,983","01:15:40,290",We now had corporate sponsorship.
"01:15:40,381","01:15:45,294",This is how Tyler and I were able to have Fight Club every night of the week.
"01:15:47,857","01:15:51,292",Now nobody was the centre of Fight Club except the two men fighting.
"01:15:51,376","01:15:54,730","The leader walked through the crowd, out in the darkness."
"01:15:56,413","01:16:00,723",Tyler was now involved in class-action a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel
"01:16:00,811","01:16:03,005",over the urine content of their soup.
"01:16:07,967","01:16:10,843",I am Jack's wasted life.
"01:16:18,242","01:16:20,232","Thank you, sir."
"01:16:21,680","01:16:24,556",Tyler dreamed up new homework assignments.
"01:16:24,638","01:16:27,071",He handed them out in sealed envelopes.
"01:17:04,617","01:17:08,131","- There's a Fight Club up in Delaware City. - Yeah, I heard."
"01:17:09,855","01:17:11,970",There's one in Penns Grove too.
"01:17:12,054","01:17:14,202",- Leave it. - Bob even found one up in New Castle.
"01:17:14,292","01:17:17,249","- Did you start that one? - No, I thought you did."
"01:17:17,331","01:17:19,719",No.
"01:18:06,425","01:18:06,465","- Stop for a second. - Hey, what are we doing?"
"01:18:06,465","01:18:08,659","- Stop for a second. - Hey, what are we doing?"
"01:18:08,744","01:18:10,699",- Turn around. - What are we doing?
"01:18:10,783","01:18:13,091",- Homework assignment. - What kind of homework assignment?
"01:18:13,182","01:18:15,137",Human sacrifice.
"01:18:15,221","01:18:18,416",- Is that a gun? Please tell me it's not a gun. - It's a gun.
"01:18:18,499","01:18:20,728",- What are you doing? - Meet me in the back.
"01:18:20,818","01:18:23,092",- Don't fuck around! - Meet me in the back.
"01:18:23,177","01:18:24,894","On a long enough time line,"
"01:18:24,976","01:18:27,727",the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.
"01:18:28,694","01:18:30,684",What are you doing? Come on!
"01:18:30,773","01:18:34,047",Hands behind the back. Give me your wallet.
"01:18:35,730","01:18:38,879","Raymond K Hessel. 1320 SE Banning, Apartment A."
"01:18:39,648","01:18:42,718","- Small, cramped basement apartment, Raymond? - How did you know?"
"01:18:42,806","01:18:45,319",Because they give shitty apartments letters instead of numbers.
"01:18:45,405","01:18:48,396",Raymond! You're going to die.
"01:18:48,483","01:18:49,882",No!
"01:18:49,963","01:18:53,954",Is that your mom and dad? Mom and dad are gonna have
"01:18:54,041","01:18:56,189","to pick up your dental records, do you wanna know why?"
"01:18:56,279","01:18:59,714","- Because there won't be nothing left of your face. - Oh, come on!"
"01:18:59,798","01:19:03,550","An expired community college student ID. What did you study, Raymond?"
"01:19:03,636","01:19:06,546",- S... S... Stuff. - Stuff?
"01:19:06,634","01:19:08,624",Were the midterms hard?
"01:19:09,712","01:19:12,179","- I asked you what you studied! - Biology, mostly."
"01:19:12,271","01:19:15,625",- Why? - I don't know.
"01:19:15,709","01:19:18,586","What did you wanna be, Raymond K Hessel?!"
"01:19:19,947","01:19:23,733","The question, Raymond, was what did you want to be?"
"01:19:25,344","01:19:27,334","Answer him, Raymond, Jesus!"
"01:19:27,423","01:19:29,731",- Veterinarian. Veterinarian. - Animals.
"01:19:29,822","01:19:32,654","- Yeah. Animals and stuff. - Stuff. Yeah, I got that."
"01:19:32,740","01:19:35,207",- That means you have to get more schooling. - Too much school.
"01:19:35,299","01:19:37,653","- Would you rather be dead? - No, please..."
"01:19:37,738","01:19:42,014","You'd rather die here, on your knees, in the back of a convenience store?"
"01:19:42,096","01:19:43,653","Please, no."
"01:19:47,573","01:19:49,563",I'm keeping your licence.
"01:19:50,771","01:19:53,648",Gonna check in on you. I know where you live.
"01:19:53,730","01:19:56,606","If you are not on your way to becoming a veterinarian in six weeks,"
"01:19:56,688","01:19:58,678",you will be dead.
"01:20:00,486","01:20:02,476",Now run on home.
"01:20:07,043","01:20:09,033","Run, Forrest, run!"
"01:20:10,601","01:20:12,591",I feel ill.
"01:20:13,359","01:20:15,349",Imagine how he feels.
"01:20:15,438","01:20:17,428","Come on, this isn't funny!"
"01:20:17,517","01:20:19,825",That wasn't funny! What the fuck was the point of that?!
"01:20:19,916","01:20:23,873",Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K Hessel's life.
"01:20:23,954","01:20:28,150",His breakfast will taste better than any meal you and I have ever tasted.
"01:20:29,511","01:20:31,501",You had to give it to him.
"01:20:31,590","01:20:33,864",- Come on. - He had a plan.
"01:20:33,949","01:20:37,223",And it started to make sense in a Tyler-sort of way.
"01:20:37,307","01:20:39,137",No fear. No distractions.
"01:20:39,226","01:20:42,421",The ability to let that which does not matter
"01:20:42,504","01:20:44,414",truly slide.
"01:20:57,257","01:20:59,292",You are not your job.
"01:21:01,135","01:21:04,364",You're not how much money you have in the bank.
"01:21:06,012","01:21:08,002",You're not the car you drive.
"01:21:08,531","01:21:11,248",You're not the contents of your wallet.
"01:21:11,329","01:21:13,523",You're not your fucking khakis.
"01:21:16,247","01:21:19,794","You are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world."
"01:21:28,280","01:21:30,395",I'll be out of your way in a sec.
"01:21:31,159","01:21:33,149",You don't have to go.
"01:21:34,597","01:21:36,587",Whatever.
"01:21:37,676","01:21:40,632","No, I mean... It's OK."
"01:21:49,789","01:21:51,779",Are you still going to groups?
"01:21:52,468","01:21:54,458",Yeah.
"01:21:55,866","01:21:57,856",Chloe's dead.
"01:21:58,345","01:22:00,255","Wow, Chloe."
"01:22:00,344","01:22:02,174",When did that happen?
"01:22:02,703","01:22:04,499",Do you care?
"01:22:04,582","01:22:07,811",I don't know. I haven't thought about it in a while.
"01:22:08,060","01:22:10,050","Yeah, well..."
"01:22:10,139","01:22:12,413",It was the smart move on her part.
"01:22:13,737","01:22:15,692",Listen...
"01:22:16,895","01:22:19,169",What are you getting out of all this?
"01:22:19,854","01:22:21,844",What?
"01:22:21,973","01:22:24,201","I mean, all this. Why do you keep..."
"01:22:24,931","01:22:26,921",Is this making you happy?
"01:22:28,449","01:22:30,439","Yeah, well, sometimes."
"01:22:32,087","01:22:34,122",I don't know. I don't understand.
"01:22:34,206","01:22:37,640",Why does a weaker person need to latch on a strong person?
"01:22:37,724","01:22:39,714",What is... What is that?
"01:22:39,803","01:22:41,872",What do you get out of it?
"01:22:43,321","01:22:45,311",No... That's not the same thing at all.
"01:22:45,400","01:22:47,390",It's totally different with us.
"01:22:47,479","01:22:49,469",Us?
"01:22:49,558","01:22:51,388",What do you mean by us?
"01:22:51,477","01:22:55,184",- I'm sorry. Do you hear this? - Hear what?
"01:22:55,275","01:22:57,230","- All that noise. Hold on. - No, wait!"
"01:22:57,314","01:22:59,907",Don't change the subject! I want to talk about this.
"01:22:59,993","01:23:02,664","- You're not talking about me, are you? - No."
"01:23:02,751","01:23:06,060",- What? - That day you came over my house to play doctor.
"01:23:06,150","01:23:09,265",- What are you talking about? - Nothing. Nothing.
"01:23:09,348","01:23:11,338","- I don't think so. - Come on, what do you want?"
"01:23:11,427","01:23:13,735",- Look at me. - No. What?
"01:23:14,465","01:23:17,183",- What is that?! - It's nothing. Don't worry.
"01:23:17,264","01:23:19,572",My God. Who did this?
"01:23:19,663","01:23:21,653",- A person. - Guy or girl?
"01:23:21,741","01:23:24,413",- Why do you care if it's a guy o girl? - Why do you care if I ask?
"01:23:24,500","01:23:26,967",- This is none of your business. Leave me alone. - You're afraid to say.
"01:23:27,059","01:23:28,969",- I am not afraid to say. Let me go! - No! Talk to me!
"01:23:29,058","01:23:30,172",Let go of me!
"01:23:30,257","01:23:32,850",- This conversation - This conversation
"01:23:32,936","01:23:35,323",- is over. - is over.
"01:23:36,134","01:23:39,124","I just can't win with you, can I?"
"01:23:48,048","01:23:50,436","Hey, this is getting a little old!"
"01:23:51,006","01:23:53,235",What is... What is all this?
"01:23:53,325","01:23:55,315",What do you think?
"01:23:56,244","01:23:58,278","Hey, why do we need bunk beds?"
"01:23:58,362","01:24:00,159",Hey!
"01:24:06,678","01:24:08,429",Too young.
"01:24:08,517","01:24:10,074",Sorry.
"01:24:10,156","01:24:12,146",What's all that?
"01:24:12,235","01:24:15,067","If the applicant is young, tell him he's too young."
"01:24:15,154","01:24:17,666","- Old, too old. Fat, too fat. - Applicant?"
"01:24:17,752","01:24:20,982","If the applicant waits at the door three days without food, shelter or encouragement,"
"01:24:21,071","01:24:23,061",then he may enter and begin his training.
"01:24:23,150","01:24:24,901",Training for what?
"01:24:30,266","01:24:32,256",You think this is a game?
"01:24:32,345","01:24:34,903","You're too young to train here, end of story."
"01:24:34,983","01:24:37,621",Quit wasting our time. Get the fuck out of here.
"01:24:41,380","01:24:43,370","Bad news, friend."
"01:24:43,619","01:24:45,609",It's not gonna happen.
"01:24:45,698","01:24:47,892",Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.
"01:24:47,977","01:24:49,807",It's not the end of the world.
"01:24:49,896","01:24:52,011",Just... go away.
"01:24:52,854","01:24:54,809",Go.
"01:24:54,893","01:24:58,406",You're trespassing and I will have to call the police.
"01:25:01,370","01:25:03,360",Don't you look at me!
"01:25:03,449","01:25:06,564",You think you're ever getting in this house? You're never getting in this fucking house!
"01:25:06,647","01:25:09,876",Never. Now get the fuck off my porch! Get off my porch!
"01:25:09,965","01:25:13,353","Sooner or later, we all became what Tyler wanted us to be."
"01:25:13,443","01:25:16,161",I'm gonna go inside and I'm gonna get a shovel.
"01:25:23,398","01:25:25,513","- Got two black shirts? - Yes, sir."
"01:25:25,597","01:25:27,746","- Two pair of black pants? - Yes, sir."
"01:25:27,836","01:25:30,667","- One pair black boots? Two pair of black socks? - Yes, sir."
"01:25:30,754","01:25:32,744","- One black jacket. - Yes, sir."
"01:25:32,833","01:25:35,710","- $300 personal burial money? - Yes, sir."
"01:25:37,791","01:25:39,781",All right.
"01:25:49,185","01:25:51,175","You're too old, fat man."
"01:25:51,264","01:25:54,299",Your tits are too big. Get the fuck off my porch.
"01:26:01,778","01:26:03,768",Bob! Bob!
"01:26:19,089","01:26:21,648",Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.
"01:26:22,368","01:26:23,800",Space monkey.
"01:26:23,887","01:26:27,241",Ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good.
"01:26:33,602","01:26:36,160","You are too fucking old, fatty!"
"01:26:36,240","01:26:39,311",And you... You're too fucking
"01:26:39,399","01:26:40,956",blond!
"01:26:41,038","01:26:43,267","Get out of here, the both of you!"
"01:26:43,357","01:26:45,347",And so it went.
"01:26:45,516","01:26:47,551","Listen up, maggots."
"01:26:47,634","01:26:49,624",You are not special.
"01:26:49,953","01:26:53,103",You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.
"01:26:53,192","01:26:57,387",You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else.
"01:26:57,469","01:26:59,504",Tyler built himself an army.
"01:26:59,708","01:27:03,221","We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world."
"01:27:03,306","01:27:06,775",We are all part of the same compost heap.
"01:27:07,784","01:27:10,899",Why was Tyler Durden building an army?
"01:27:10,982","01:27:12,972",To what purpose?
"01:27:13,061","01:27:15,369",For what greater good?
"01:27:18,578","01:27:20,568",In Tyler we trusted.
"01:27:25,655","01:27:28,247","(man) When he was like, ""You are not your job"","
"01:27:28,333","01:27:30,323","I was like, ""Yeah!"""
"01:27:32,131","01:27:34,121","Hey, what's all this?"
"01:27:34,210","01:27:36,200",Hey!
"01:27:37,648","01:27:39,240",OK!
"01:27:39,328","01:27:41,601",- What's going on? - We're celebrating.
"01:27:41,686","01:27:44,074",- What are we celebrating? - Go in.
"01:27:47,923","01:27:49,992",- Hey. - Let me get that for you.
"01:27:54,400","01:27:57,196","The same great taste, Pepsi. Generation next."
"01:27:59,437","01:28:01,586",Ssh!
"01:28:01,676","01:28:05,303",Investigators are around on the scene. Hold on. The Police Commissioner Jacobs has arrived.
"01:28:05,394","01:28:08,226","Commissioner, could you please tell us what you think has happened here?"
"01:28:08,313","01:28:12,383",We believe this is one of many recent acts of vandalism around the city
"01:28:12,470","01:28:15,461",somehow related to underground boxing clubs.
"01:28:15,549","01:28:19,586",We will be coordinating a rigorous investigation.
"01:28:20,466","01:28:24,662",That was Police Commissioner Jacobs who just arrived on the scene here
"01:28:24,744","01:28:28,815",- of a four-alarm fire that broke out abount an hour ago... - She's hot.
"01:28:28,902","01:28:30,653",Back to you in the studio.
"01:28:30,741","01:28:33,015",- Yeah! - Yeah!
"01:28:33,939","01:28:36,372",- Holy shit! - Yeah!
"01:28:43,374","01:28:45,329",What the fuck did you guys do?
"01:28:45,413","01:28:49,324",Arson investigators are on the premises...
"01:28:52,929","01:28:57,318","Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions, sir."
"01:29:03,284","01:29:05,672",The victory in the war against crime
"01:29:05,763","01:29:07,753",will not come overnight.
"01:29:07,842","01:29:12,196","It will take dedication and commitment and, most of all, cooperation."
"01:29:12,279","01:29:16,987",Streets are safer now. There is hope in the inner city. However...
"01:29:17,077","01:29:18,987",I gotta take a piss.
"01:29:19,076","01:29:21,713",These are the first steps in a long journey.
"01:29:21,794","01:29:24,307",That is why we have created Project Hope.
"01:29:24,393","01:29:26,383",Bob.
"01:29:29,350","01:29:32,022",Project Hope will be a joint effort
"01:29:32,109","01:29:34,747",between the police and community leaders.
"01:29:34,828","01:29:38,818",It will be a powerful new weapon in the war against crime.
"01:30:22,363","01:30:26,354","- Wrap it around the top of his hacky-sack, Bob. - Yeah, his balls are ice cold."
"01:30:28,280","01:30:31,475",Hi. You're gonna call off your rigorous investigation.
"01:30:31,558","01:30:34,753",You're gonna publicly state there is no underground group or
"01:30:34,836","01:30:37,065",these guys are gonna take your balls.
"01:30:37,915","01:30:41,542",They'll send one to the New York Times and one to the LA Times. Press release style.
"01:30:41,633","01:30:43,304",Look.
"01:30:43,392","01:30:46,348",The people you are after are the people you depend on.
"01:30:46,430","01:30:49,865",We cook your meals. We haul your trash. We connect your calls.
"01:30:49,949","01:30:53,542",We drive your ambulances. We guard you while you sleep.
"01:30:57,784","01:31:00,456",Do not fuck with us.
"01:31:07,579","01:31:09,614",Ball check!
"01:31:23,371","01:31:25,361","Bob, you're this way."
"01:31:26,410","01:31:28,638",Let's go.
"01:31:28,728","01:31:31,799",I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.
"01:31:32,846","01:31:34,836",Hey!
"01:31:48,718","01:31:49,945",Yeah!
"01:32:21,341","01:32:24,013",I felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every panda
"01:32:24,100","01:32:27,807",that wouldn't screw to save its species.
"01:32:29,857","01:32:32,528",I wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers
"01:32:32,615","01:32:35,367",and smother all those French beaches I'd never see.
"01:32:38,492","01:32:40,880",I wanted to breathe smoke.
"01:32:57,522","01:32:59,557","Where did you go, psycho boy?"
"01:33:01,240","01:33:04,037",I felt like destroying something beautiful.
"01:33:07,397","01:33:09,387",Get him to a fucking hospital.
"01:33:09,476","01:33:11,466",Yeah.
"01:33:21,790","01:33:24,746","Don't worry, Mr. Durden. Airport parking. Long term."
"01:33:26,187","01:33:28,177","After you, Mr. Durden."
"01:33:29,106","01:33:31,096",After you.
"01:33:48,136","01:33:50,603","- Something on your mind, dear? - No."
"01:33:50,695","01:33:53,810","Yeah, why wasn't I told about Project Mayhem?"
"01:33:53,893","01:33:56,769",The first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not ask questions.
"01:33:56,851","01:33:59,125",- What are you talking about? - Why didn't you include me in the beginning?
"01:33:59,210","01:34:04,202",Fight Club was the beginning. Now it's out of the basements and it's called Project Mayhem.
"01:34:04,288","01:34:08,483",You and I started Fight Club together. Do you remember that?
"01:34:08,565","01:34:12,636",- Is this about you and me? - Yeah. I thought we were doing this together?
"01:34:12,723","01:34:16,031",You are missing the point. This does not belong to us. We are not special.
"01:34:16,121","01:34:18,429",Fuck that. You should have told me.
"01:34:19,240","01:34:21,150","Hey, Tyler!"
"01:34:22,918","01:34:25,306","- Goddamn it, Tyler! - What do you want?!"
"01:34:25,397","01:34:27,750",A statement of purpose? Should I e-mail you?
"01:34:27,835","01:34:30,394",- Oh... look... - You decide your level of involvement!
"01:34:30,474","01:34:33,033",I will! I wanna know certain things first!
"01:34:33,113","01:34:35,625",- The first rule of Project Mayhem... - Shut up!
"01:34:37,310","01:34:40,903",- I wanna know what you're thinking. - Fuck what you know!  You need to forget about
"01:34:40,988","01:34:44,297","Forget about what you think you know about life, about friendship,"
"01:34:44,387","01:34:46,377",and especially about you and me.
"01:34:47,505","01:34:49,574",What is that supposed to mean?
"01:34:52,822","01:34:54,891",What are you doing?
"01:34:55,781","01:34:58,373","Guys, what do you wish you'd done before you died?"
"01:34:58,459","01:35:01,211",- Paint a self-portrait. - Build a house.
"01:35:01,298","01:35:03,572",- And you? - I don't know. Nothing.
"01:35:03,657","01:35:05,964",- Get in the right lane. - You have to know! You have to know
"01:35:06,055","01:35:08,966","If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?"
"01:35:09,054","01:35:12,567",I don't know! I wouldn't feel anything good about my life. Is that what you
"01:35:12,652","01:35:14,846",- Fine. Come on! - Not good enough.
"01:35:14,931","01:35:17,285",Stop fucking around! Tyler!
"01:35:18,489","01:35:20,638",Jesus Christ!
"01:35:21,367","01:35:23,357",Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck you!
"01:35:23,446","01:35:25,436",Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!
"01:35:25,525","01:35:28,084",I am sick of all your shit!
"01:35:28,164","01:35:29,994","OK, man."
"01:35:31,722","01:35:34,155","- Quit screwing around, take the wheel! - Look at you!"
"01:35:34,241","01:35:36,878",- Take the wheel! - Look at you! You're fucking pathetic!
"01:35:36,959","01:35:41,872",- Why? Why? What are you talking about? - Why do you think I blew up your condo?
"01:35:42,476","01:35:43,955",What?
"01:35:44,036","01:35:47,788",Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat. It's not a goddamned seminar.
"01:35:47,874","01:35:51,421",Stop trying to control everything and just let go!
"01:35:53,071","01:35:54,867",Let go!
"01:35:54,950","01:35:56,940",All right. Fine.
"01:35:57,789","01:35:59,619",Fine.
"01:36:55,558","01:36:57,946",I'd never been in a car accident.
"01:36:58,037","01:37:01,312",This must have been what all those people felt like
"01:37:01,395","01:37:04,466",before I filed them as statistics in my reports.
"01:37:04,554","01:37:06,544",Goddamn!
"01:37:09,911","01:37:12,946",We've just had a near-life experience!
"01:37:16,628","01:37:18,538","In the world I see,"
"01:37:18,627","01:37:22,334",you're stalking elk through the damp canyon forests
"01:37:22,425","01:37:25,301",around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.
"01:37:27,222","01:37:31,418",You'll wear leather clothes that will last you the rest of your life.
"01:37:31,500","01:37:35,855",You'll climb the wrist-thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower.
"01:37:35,938","01:37:40,326","And when you look down, you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,"
"01:37:40,415","01:37:43,803",laying strips of venison in the empty car pool lane
"01:37:43,893","01:37:46,087",of some abandoned superhighway.
"01:37:58,966","01:38:01,114","Feel better, champ."
"01:38:17,756","01:38:19,473",And then...
"01:38:19,555","01:38:21,033",Tyler?
"01:38:21,114","01:38:23,104",...Tyler was gone.
"01:38:30,189","01:38:32,144",Was I asleep?
"01:38:33,188","01:38:35,143",Had I slept?
"01:38:35,227","01:38:38,137","You are not a beautiful, unique snowflake. You understand me?"
"01:38:38,225","01:38:40,579",The house had become a living thing.
"01:38:40,664","01:38:45,099",Wet inside from so many people sweating and breathing.
"01:38:45,581","01:38:48,048","So many people moving, the house moved."
"01:38:50,819","01:38:52,809",Planet Tyler.
"01:38:52,898","01:38:54,887",I had to hug the walls.
"01:38:54,976","01:38:57,967",Trapped inside this clockwork of space monkeys.
"01:38:58,055","01:39:01,682",You shouldn't be smoking in here! You know how much ether we have
"01:39:01,773","01:39:04,161",Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.
"01:39:06,331","01:39:08,320",Hang on a second.
"01:39:26,440","01:39:29,033","It's under control, sir."
"01:39:31,398","01:39:33,149",Where's Tyler?
"01:39:33,237","01:39:36,113","Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem is you do not..."
"01:39:36,195","01:39:38,071",Right... OK.
"01:39:40,393","01:39:42,383",I'm all alone.
"01:39:42,552","01:39:46,065",My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.
"01:39:46,150","01:39:48,299",I am Jack's broken heart.
"01:39:52,347","01:39:55,974",What comes next in Project Mayhem only Tyler knows.
"01:39:56,864","01:39:59,935",The second rule is you do not ask questions.
"01:40:02,621","01:40:05,214",Get the fuck away from me! Get the fuck away!
"01:40:05,580","01:40:07,570",Who are all these people?
"01:40:12,616","01:40:14,810",Paper Street Soap Company.
"01:40:16,294","01:40:18,284",Can I come in?
"01:40:21,292","01:40:23,282",He's not here.
"01:40:23,370","01:40:25,485",What?
"01:40:26,489","01:40:29,923",Tyler isn't here.
"01:40:30,007","01:40:31,997",Tyler went away.
"01:40:32,406","01:40:34,396",Tyler's gone.
"01:40:50,716","01:40:52,353",Get some help!
"01:41:03,070","01:41:07,743",Two gunshot wounds coming through! Make some fucking room!
"01:41:07,827","01:41:10,135",What happened? What happened?
"01:41:10,226","01:41:12,978",We were on assignment. We were supposed to kill two birds with one stone.
"01:41:14,224","01:41:16,214",Destroy a piece of corporate art...
"01:41:16,303","01:41:18,691",Operation Latte Thunder. Go!
"01:41:19,381","01:41:22,417",..and trash a franchise coffee bar.
"01:41:28,577","01:41:30,805","We had it all worked out, sir."
"01:41:38,651","01:41:41,801",- It went smooth until... - Police! Freeze!
"01:41:41,890","01:41:44,527",- What? - They shot Bob.
"01:41:45,968","01:41:48,275",- They shot him in the head. - Fucking pigs!
"01:41:53,444","01:41:55,399","Oh, God!"
"01:41:55,483","01:41:58,598",- Those motherfuckers! - You morons.
"01:41:58,681","01:42:02,638",You're running around in ski masks trying to blow things up?
"01:42:02,719","01:42:05,278",What did you think was gonna happen?!
"01:42:06,997","01:42:11,146","OK, quick! We gotta get rid of the evidence. We gotta get rid of this body!"
"01:42:11,234","01:42:13,986",- Bury him. - What?
"01:42:14,073","01:42:16,222",Take him to the garden and bury him.
"01:42:16,312","01:42:19,063","- Come on, people, let's go! - Get the fuck off!"
"01:42:19,150","01:42:22,266",Get away from him! What are you talking about?
"01:42:22,349","01:42:24,815",This isn't fucking piece of evidence. This is a person.
"01:42:24,907","01:42:27,978",He's a friend of mine and you're not gonna bury him in the fucking garden!
"01:42:28,066","01:42:30,942","He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir."
"01:42:31,024","01:42:32,979","- This is Bob. - Sir, in..."
"01:42:33,063","01:42:35,053","In Project Mayhem, we have no names."
"01:42:35,142","01:42:37,052","Now, you listen to me."
"01:42:37,141","01:42:41,496","This is a man and he has a name, and it's Robert Paulsen, OK?"
"01:42:41,579","01:42:43,409",- Robert Paulsen. - He's a man
"01:42:43,498","01:42:46,215",and he's dead now because of us. All right? Do you understand that?
"01:42:46,856","01:42:49,050",I understand.
"01:42:51,214","01:42:54,409","In death, a member of Project Mayhem"
"01:42:54,492","01:42:56,482",has a name.
"01:42:56,611","01:42:59,407",His name is Robert Paulsen.
"01:42:59,849","01:43:01,839",His name is Robert Paulsen.
"01:43:02,608","01:43:05,166",His name... is Robert Paulsen.
"01:43:05,246","01:43:08,919",His name is Robert Paulsen.
"01:43:09,004","01:43:11,961","Come on, guys. Please. Stop it."
"01:43:12,043","01:43:14,510",His name is Robert Paulsen.
"01:43:14,601","01:43:17,558",Shut up! This is all over with!
"01:43:20,678","01:43:23,066",Get the fuck out of here.
"01:43:50,623","01:43:54,853","- Tyler? - No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit."
"01:43:54,941","01:43:56,453",I need to see you in the office...
"01:44:00,777","01:44:04,654","I went to all the cities on Tyler's used ticket stubs, barhopping."
"01:44:04,735","01:44:09,284","I didn't know how or why, but I could look at 50 different bars, and somehow I just knew."
"01:44:09,373","01:44:13,762",I'm looking for Tyler Durden. It's very important that I talk to him.
"01:44:13,851","01:44:15,442","I wish I could help you,"
"01:44:15,530","01:44:17,724",sir.
"01:44:22,806","01:44:24,796","Every city I went to,"
"01:44:25,804","01:44:28,112",as soon as I set foot off the plane
"01:44:28,683","01:44:30,877",I knew a Fight Club was close.
"01:44:30,962","01:44:32,553",Hey! Hey!
"01:44:33,600","01:44:35,113",Taxi!
"01:44:35,200","01:44:37,190",Look at my face. I'm a member.
"01:44:37,279","01:44:39,711","Now, I just need to know if you've seen Tyler."
"01:44:39,797","01:44:43,344","I'm not exposed to bespeak any such information to you,"
"01:44:43,435","01:44:47,949","nor would I even if I had said information you want, at this juncture... be able."
"01:44:48,593","01:44:52,140",- You're a moron. - I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
"01:44:53,430","01:44:58,263",Tyler had been busy... setting up franchises all over the country.
"01:45:00,906","01:45:05,182",Was I asleep? Had I slept?
"01:45:05,264","01:45:07,413","Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?"
"01:45:08,742","01:45:11,699",- We've just heard the stories. - What kind of stories?
"01:45:11,781","01:45:15,851",- Like nobody knows what he looks like. - He has facial reconstructive surgery every three years.
"01:45:15,938","01:45:18,849",That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
"01:45:18,937","01:45:22,848",- Is it true about Fight Club in Miami? - Is Mr. Durden building an army?
"01:45:22,935","01:45:25,811",I was living in a state of perpetual deja vu.
"01:45:26,613","01:45:28,603","Everywhere I went,"
"01:45:28,692","01:45:30,568",I felt I'd already been there.
"01:45:30,651","01:45:33,447",It was like following an invisible man.
"01:45:34,489","01:45:36,479","The smell of dried blood,"
"01:45:36,568","01:45:39,956","dirty, bare footprints circling each other."
"01:45:40,766","01:45:43,836","That aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken."
"01:45:43,924","01:45:47,312",The feel of a floor still warm from a fight the night before.
"01:45:48,162","01:45:50,958",I was always just one step behind Tyler.
"01:45:53,759","01:45:56,749",His name is Robert Paulsen...
"01:46:01,195","01:46:03,185","Welcome back, sir."
"01:46:04,113","01:46:06,103",How have you been?
"01:46:06,192","01:46:08,261",Do you know me?
"01:46:08,351","01:46:10,659","Is this a test, sir?"
"01:46:10,750","01:46:12,546",No. This is not a test.
"01:46:12,629","01:46:14,744",You were in here last Thursday.
"01:46:15,308","01:46:17,501",Thursday?
"01:46:17,586","01:46:21,372","You were standing exactly where you are now, asking how good security is."
"01:46:22,024","01:46:24,014","It's tight as a drum, sir."
"01:46:26,582","01:46:28,651",Who do you think I am?
"01:46:28,741","01:46:31,173",Are you sure this isn't a test?
"01:46:31,259","01:46:33,089","No, this is not a test."
"01:46:33,178","01:46:35,168",You're Mr. Durden.
"01:46:36,457","01:46:39,015",You're the one who gave me this.
"01:46:39,095","01:46:43,132",Please return your seat backs to their full upright and locked position.
"01:46:54,087","01:46:56,077","- Yeah? - Marla, it's me."
"01:46:56,166","01:46:58,042",- Have we ever done it? - Done what?
"01:46:58,125","01:46:59,444",Have we ever had sex?
"01:46:59,525","01:47:01,594",What kind of stupid question is that?
"01:47:01,683","01:47:03,957","Is it stupid because the answer is ""yes"" or because the answer is ""no""?"
"01:47:04,042","01:47:06,509","- Is this a trick? - No, Marla. I need to know..."
"01:47:06,601","01:47:10,308",You wanna know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
"01:47:10,399","01:47:13,673",- We did make love? - Is that what you're calling it?
"01:47:13,757","01:47:16,475","Just answer the question, Marla, please! Did we do it or not?!"
"01:47:16,556","01:47:19,352","You fuck me, then snub me. You love me, you hate me."
"01:47:19,434","01:47:22,186","You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole."
"01:47:22,273","01:47:24,831","Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?"
"01:47:24,911","01:47:26,901",We have just lost cabin pressure.
"01:47:26,990","01:47:28,423",What did you just say?
"01:47:28,510","01:47:30,738",- What is wrong with you? - What did you just called me? Say my name!
"01:47:30,828","01:47:34,341",Tyler Durden! Tyler Durden! You fucking freak! What's going on?
"01:47:34,426","01:47:36,416","- I'm coming over! - No, wait, Marla! I'm not there!"
"01:47:36,505","01:47:39,177",You broke your promise.
"01:47:39,264","01:47:41,140","Jesus, Tyler."
"01:47:41,223","01:47:44,531",- You fucking talked to her about me. - What the fuck is going on here?
"01:47:44,621","01:47:47,929",I asked you for one thing. One simple thing.
"01:47:48,019","01:47:50,248",Why do people think that I'm you?
"01:47:50,778","01:47:52,768",Answer me!
"01:47:55,056","01:47:56,807",Sit.
"01:47:59,493","01:48:02,086",Answer me. Why do people think I'm you?
"01:48:02,172","01:48:04,241",I think you know.
"01:48:04,371","01:48:06,838","- No, I don't. - Yes, you do."
"01:48:06,930","01:48:09,567",Why would anyone possibly confuse you with me?
"01:48:09,648","01:48:12,320",I... I don't know.
"01:48:16,884","01:48:19,636",- You got it. - No.
"01:48:19,723","01:48:21,758",- Do not fuck with us! - Say it.
"01:48:23,081","01:48:25,036",Because...
"01:48:26,319","01:48:27,434",Say it!
"01:48:29,038","01:48:30,993",Because we're the same person.
"01:48:31,077","01:48:33,112",That's right.
"01:48:33,196","01:48:35,265","We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap."
"01:48:35,355","01:48:38,902",- I don't understand this. - You were looking for a way to change your life.
"01:48:38,993","01:48:40,983",You could not do this on your own.
"01:48:41,072","01:48:43,062","All the ways you wish you could be,"
"01:48:43,151","01:48:44,947",that's me.
"01:48:45,030","01:48:48,065","I look like you wanna look, I fuck like you wanna fuck."
"01:48:48,148","01:48:50,377","I am smart, capable and, most importantly,"
"01:48:50,467","01:48:53,105",I'm free in all the ways that you are not.
"01:48:53,186","01:48:54,140","Oh, no."
"01:48:54,225","01:48:57,022",- Tyler's not here. Tyler went away. - What?
"01:48:57,103","01:48:59,332",This isn't possible. This is crazy.
"01:48:59,422","01:49:01,377",People do it every day.
"01:49:01,461","01:49:04,849",They talk to themselves. They see themselves as they'd like to be.
"01:49:04,939","01:49:08,055","They don't have the courage you have, to just run with it."
"01:49:11,696","01:49:14,925","Naturally you still wrestling with it, so sometimes you're still you."
"01:49:15,014","01:49:19,528","- We should do this again sometime. - Other times, you imagine yourself watching me."
"01:49:19,612","01:49:22,000","If this is your first night at fight club, you have to fight."
"01:49:22,090","01:49:26,286","Little by little, you're just letting yourself become"
"01:49:27,088","01:49:28,918",Tyler Durden.
"01:49:29,007","01:49:31,679",You are not your job or how much money you have in the bank!
"01:49:31,765","01:49:34,073",- No. You have a house. - Rented in your name.
"01:49:34,164","01:49:37,632","- You have jobs, you have a whole life. - You have night jobs, because you can't sleep."
"01:49:37,722","01:49:39,439",Or you stay up and make soap.
"01:49:39,521","01:49:44,274","- You're fucking Marla, Tyler. - Technically, you are fucking Marla."
"01:49:45,918","01:49:47,873","Oh, my God."
"01:49:48,837","01:49:50,827",Now you see our dilemma.
"01:49:50,916","01:49:53,109",She knows too much.
"01:49:53,194","01:49:58,107",I think we're gonna have to talk about how this might compromise our goals.
"01:49:58,192","01:50:00,227",What... What are you saying?
"01:50:01,150","01:50:05,221","This is bullshit. This is bullshit, I'm not listening to this!"
"01:50:05,308","01:50:07,867",- You are insane! - No. You're insane.
"01:50:07,947","01:50:10,584",We simply do not have time for this crap.
"01:50:11,985","01:50:14,099",It's called a changeover.
"01:50:14,183","01:50:16,173",The movie goes on
"01:50:16,262","01:50:19,253",and nobody in the audience has any idea.
"01:50:31,694","01:50:35,207",- Sir! Are you checking out? - Yeah. Bill me.
"01:50:35,292","01:50:37,600","I need you to initiate this list of phone calls, please."
"01:50:41,849","01:50:45,726","- When were these made? - It says right there, sir."
"01:50:51,324","01:50:55,281",Had I been going to bed earlier every night? Have I been sleeping later?
"01:50:55,362","01:51:00,036",Have I been Tyler longer and longer?
"01:51:02,438","01:51:04,746",Is anybody here?
"01:51:07,316","01:51:09,306",Deja vu all over again.
"01:51:10,914","01:51:13,302","With enough soap, we could blow just about anything."
"01:51:15,552","01:51:17,541","Oh, my God."
"01:51:21,269","01:51:23,542",- 1888. - Who am I calling?
"01:51:23,947","01:51:27,460",1888 Franklin. This is maintenance. Hello?
"01:51:28,585","01:51:30,142",Hello?
"01:51:30,224","01:51:32,214",1888 Franklin Street?
"01:51:32,303","01:51:34,293",Yes. Can I help you?
"01:51:36,661","01:51:39,127","- Hello? - Yeah, yeah."
"01:51:39,219","01:51:41,652",I need to talk to your supervisor right away.
"01:51:41,738","01:51:43,728","- Speaking. - OK, listen to me."
"01:51:43,817","01:51:46,852",I think something really terrible is about to happen in your building.
"01:51:46,935","01:51:48,925","It's under control, sir."
"01:51:49,374","01:51:52,762","- Excuse me? - Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid."
"01:51:56,850","01:51:58,123",2160.
"01:52:05,446","01:52:07,833","Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!"
"01:52:09,483","01:52:12,155",Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!
"01:52:12,242","01:52:16,233",Your whacked-out bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom!
"01:52:16,320","01:52:18,958",They were burning their fingertips with lye. The stink was unbelievable.
"01:52:19,039","01:52:22,825","Look... listen. It'll take a tremendous act of faith on your part,"
"01:52:22,917","01:52:26,703",- Here comes an avalanche of bullshit. - A little more faith than that.
"01:52:29,793","01:52:32,260","No, listen. I don't want to hear anything you have to say."
"01:52:32,352","01:52:34,387",You have every right to be...
"01:52:34,950","01:52:36,746","I'll just have a coffee, thanks."
"01:52:36,829","01:52:39,661","Sir. Anything you order is free of charge, sir."
"01:52:39,748","01:52:41,703",Why is it free of charge?
"01:52:41,787","01:52:43,742",- Don't ask. - Whatever.
"01:52:43,826","01:52:49,102","I'll have the clam chowder, the fried chicken and a baked potato with"
"01:52:49,183","01:52:51,173","Clean food, please."
"01:52:51,262","01:52:54,172","In that case, sir, may I advise against the lady eating the clam chowder."
"01:52:54,260","01:52:56,250",No clam chowder. Thank you.
"01:52:57,658","01:52:59,807",You got about 30 seconds.
"01:53:02,376","01:53:04,809","I know I've been acting very, very strange, OK?"
"01:53:04,895","01:53:08,169",- I know it' been like there's two sides to me... - Two sides?
"01:53:08,253","01:53:13,085","- You're Dr Jekyll and Mr Jackass. - I deserve that, but I've come to"
"01:53:13,170","01:53:17,081",- What? - The full extent of our relationship
"01:53:17,168","01:53:19,442","to me up until now, for reasons I'm no going into."
"01:53:19,527","01:53:21,994",- But the important thing is that I know I haven't been treating you so well.
"01:53:22,086","01:53:24,678","No, no. Fifteen seconds! Fifteen seconds, please!"
"01:53:24,764","01:53:26,958","Fifteen seconds, please, don't open your mouth."
"01:53:27,043","01:53:29,033",I'm trying to tell that you I'm sorry.
"01:53:29,122","01:53:33,238","Because what I've come to realize is that I really like you, Marla."
"01:53:33,320","01:53:35,355",You do?
"01:53:35,439","01:53:37,235",I really do.
"01:53:37,318","01:53:41,468",I care about you and I don't want anything bad to happen to you because of me.
"01:53:41,556","01:53:44,193","Marla, your life is in danger."
"01:53:44,274","01:53:46,104",What?
"01:53:46,193","01:53:49,740",You need to leave town for a while. Get out of any major city.
"01:53:49,831","01:53:52,503",- Go camping or something... - You're an insane person.
"01:53:52,590","01:53:55,898",- No. I've involved you in something terrible that's about to happen. You are not safe...
"01:53:55,988","01:53:58,421",- You're not safe. - Shut up!
"01:54:00,146","01:54:04,422","- Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried. - I know you did."
"01:54:04,504","01:54:07,414","There are things about you I like. You're smart, you're funny."
"01:54:07,502","01:54:09,378",You're spectacular in bed.
"01:54:09,461","01:54:10,813",But
"01:54:10,900","01:54:12,890",you're intolerable.
"01:54:12,979","01:54:15,367",You have very serious emotional problems.
"01:54:15,458","01:54:19,244",Deep-seated problems for which you should seek professional help.
"01:54:19,336","01:54:23,122","- I know, and I'm sorry. - You're sorry, I'm sorry. Everyone's sorry. But..."
"01:54:24,253","01:54:26,243",...I can't do this any more.
"01:54:26,332","01:54:28,322",I can't.
"01:54:28,411","01:54:30,401",And I won't.
"01:54:30,490","01:54:32,445",I'm gone.
"01:54:32,529","01:54:35,088","You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!"
"01:54:37,806","01:54:40,365","- Marla, you don't understand! - Leave me alone!"
"01:54:40,445","01:54:42,878","- Marla, I am trying to protect you! - Let go!"
"01:54:42,964","01:54:45,840","- I don't ever want to see you again! - That's fine, if that's what it takes."
"01:54:45,922","01:54:47,912","Hold on, wait right here!"
"01:54:51,679","01:54:54,112",Hold it right there! Shut up!
"01:54:54,198","01:54:56,233",Take this money and get on this bus.
"01:54:56,317","01:54:58,386","I promise I will never bother you again, if that's what you want."
"01:54:58,476","01:54:59,874",Shut up!
"01:54:59,955","01:55:03,025",Please get on the bus. Please get on the bus.
"01:55:04,153","01:55:06,143",Why are you doing this?
"01:55:06,232","01:55:10,143","They think you are some kind of a threat. I can't explain it now, just trust me!"
"01:55:10,230","01:55:14,425","- If I see where you're going, you won't be safe. - I'm not paying this back, I consider it ""asshole tax""."
"01:55:14,507","01:55:18,703","- Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities, for at least a couple of days, OK?"
"01:55:20,184","01:55:22,902",You're the worst thing that ever happened to me.
"01:55:37,295","01:55:39,854",Hello. I need you to arrest me.
"01:55:39,934","01:55:42,572",I am the leader of a terrorist organisation
"01:55:42,653","01:55:47,405",responsible for numerous acts of vandalism and assault all over this city.
"01:55:47,490","01:55:51,197","In the metropolitan area, we had probably a couple hundred members."
"01:55:51,288","01:55:54,961",Chapters have sprung up in five or six other major cities already.
"01:55:55,086","01:55:57,997",This is a tightly-regimented organisation
"01:55:58,085","01:56:03,475",with many cells capable of operating completely independent of central leadership.
"01:56:03,562","01:56:07,269","Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street."
"01:56:07,360","01:56:09,190",That's our headquarters.
"01:56:09,279","01:56:11,746","In the back, buried in the garden,"
"01:56:11,838","01:56:14,748",you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.
"01:56:14,836","01:56:18,031","In the basement, you're gonna find some bathtubs"
"01:56:18,114","01:56:23,232",that have been used very recently to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.
"01:56:23,312","01:56:25,267",I believe the plan is to blow up
"01:56:25,351","01:56:28,307",the headquarters of these credit card companies
"01:56:28,389","01:56:30,379",and the TRW building.
"01:56:31,307","01:56:34,503",Why these buildings? Why credit card companies?
"01:56:34,586","01:56:38,054","If you erase the debt record, then we all go back to zero."
"01:56:38,863","01:56:40,853",You'll create total chaos.
"01:56:42,382","01:56:45,497",Keep him talking. I need to make a phone call.
"01:56:55,615","01:56:57,764",I really admire what you're doing.
"01:56:58,213","01:57:00,203",What?
"01:57:00,292","01:57:02,247",You're a brave man to order this.
"01:57:02,331","01:57:04,048","You're a genius, sir."
"01:57:04,130","01:57:08,679","You said if anyone ever interferes with Project Mayhem, even you,"
"01:57:08,768","01:57:10,997",we gotta get his balls.
"01:57:12,366","01:57:15,401","- It's useless to fight. - It's really a powerful gesture, Mr. Durden."
"01:57:15,484","01:57:18,395","- It'll set quite an example. - You're making a big mistake, fellas!"
"01:57:18,483","01:57:21,200",- You said you'd say that. - I'm not Tyler Durden!
"01:57:21,281","01:57:24,989",- You told us you'd say that too. - All right. I am Tyler Durden.
"01:57:25,079","01:57:27,672",Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct order.
"01:57:27,758","01:57:31,749",- We're aborting this mission right now. - You said you would definitely say that.
"01:57:37,633","01:57:41,021",Are you fucking out of your minds? You're police officers!
"01:57:41,831","01:57:43,821",Is somebody timing this?
"01:57:43,990","01:57:46,821",Keep your mouth shut.
"01:57:46,908","01:57:48,898",Shit!
"01:57:51,426","01:57:54,097",Some of this information checks out.
"01:57:54,184","01:57:57,334",- Let's go over to that house on Paper Street. - Be right there.
"01:57:58,022","01:57:59,739","Hey, wait!"
"01:58:00,381","01:58:02,814","- I got him. - Sir, we have to do this."
"01:58:02,900","01:58:05,288",- Stop fighting! - Where's the rubber band?
"01:58:05,379","01:58:07,766",Get away from me! Drop that fucking knife! Drop it!
"01:58:11,176","01:58:14,450",Back up. Face down on the floor both you right now!
"01:58:15,653","01:58:17,608",Get down on the floor!
"01:58:22,170","01:58:24,921",The first person that comes out of this fucking door
"01:58:25,008","01:58:26,884",gets... gets a lead salad! Understand?
"01:58:50,235","01:58:52,702",Get away! Stay away!
"01:59:05,107","01:59:07,097",I ran.
"01:59:07,626","01:59:11,617",I ran until my muscles burned and my veins pumped battery acid.
"01:59:14,143","01:59:16,133",Then I ran some more.
"01:59:55,121","01:59:57,350",What the fuck are you doing?
"01:59:57,440","02:00:00,272","Running around in your underpants? Man, you look like a crazy person!"
"02:00:00,359","02:00:03,349",No. I'm onto you. I know what's going on here.
"02:00:03,437","02:00:08,145","Come on, then. I got us some great place to watch from. It'll be like pay-per-view."
"02:00:54,131","02:00:56,689","- Oh, Christ. - Now what are you doing?"
"02:00:56,769","02:00:59,999",- I'm stopping this. - Why?
"02:01:00,088","02:01:03,317","- The greatest thing you've ever done, man. - I can't let this happen."
"02:01:03,406","02:01:06,521",There are 10 other bombs in 10 other buildings.
"02:01:06,604","02:01:08,833",Goddamn it! Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
"02:01:08,923","02:01:10,833",The buildings are empty.
"02:01:10,922","02:01:13,640",Security and maintenance are all our people. We're not killing
"02:01:13,721","02:01:16,392",Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.
"02:01:16,479","02:01:19,709","You wanna make an omelette, you gotta break some eggs."
"02:01:19,797","02:01:23,232",No. I'm not listening to you. You're not even there.
"02:01:29,033","02:01:33,228",I wouldn't do that. Unless you knew which wires were what.
"02:01:33,310","02:01:34,948","If you know, then I know."
"02:01:40,347","02:01:44,497","Or - maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent the whole day thinking about the wrong ones."
"02:01:52,700","02:01:53,735",You think?
"02:01:55,659","02:01:57,649","Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one."
"02:01:58,497","02:02:01,374",Pull anyone but the green one.
"02:02:05,894","02:02:08,406",I asked you not to do that!
"02:02:10,171","02:02:11,684",Fuck!
"02:02:12,570","02:02:14,605","Tyler, get away from the van."
"02:02:16,728","02:02:19,957","Tyler, I'm not kidding! Get away from the van!"
"02:02:20,046","02:02:21,364",Goddamn it!
"02:02:27,442","02:02:28,761",OK.
"02:02:28,842","02:02:32,071",You are now firing a gun at your imaginary friend
"02:02:32,160","02:02:34,627",near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!
"02:02:36,757","02:02:38,429","Cool it, Tyler! Tyler!"
"02:02:51,110","02:02:53,100",Come on!
"02:02:53,189","02:02:55,144",Don't go!
"02:03:31,169","02:03:32,318",What?!
"02:04:15,386","02:04:15,546",Three minutes.
"02:04:15,546","02:04:17,376",Three minutes.
"02:04:17,465","02:04:19,659",This is it.
"02:04:19,744","02:04:21,699",The beginning.
"02:04:21,783","02:04:23,659",Ground zero.
"02:04:23,742","02:04:25,936",I think this is about where we came in.
"02:04:26,021","02:04:28,374",Would you like to say a few words to mark the occasion?
"02:04:28,459","02:04:31,370",I'm sorry?
"02:04:31,458","02:04:33,448",I still can't think of anything.
"02:04:35,416","02:04:37,406",Flashback humour.
"02:04:42,292","02:04:44,247",It's getting exciting now.
"02:04:45,730","02:04:47,448",Two and a half.
"02:04:47,530","02:04:49,996","Think of everything we've accomplished, man."
"02:04:50,088","02:04:54,682","Out these windows, we will view the collapse of financial history."
"02:04:54,766","02:04:58,313",One step closer to economic equilibrium.
"02:05:11,357","02:05:13,631",Why is she here?
"02:05:13,716","02:05:15,546",Tying up loose ends.
"02:05:15,635","02:05:18,591","Put me down, you baldheaded fuck!"
"02:05:18,673","02:05:21,664","- I'm begging you, please don't do this. - I'm not doing this."
"02:05:21,752","02:05:25,060",- We are doing this. This is what we want. - No.
"02:05:25,150","02:05:29,664",- I don't want this. - Right. Except you is meaningless now.
"02:05:29,748","02:05:33,580",- We have to forget about you. - You're a voice in my head.
"02:05:33,666","02:05:35,655",You're a voice in mine!
"02:05:35,744","02:05:38,462","-  You're a fucking hallucination, why can't I get rid of you?"
"02:05:38,543","02:05:40,533",No. I don't. I really don't any more.
"02:05:40,622","02:05:44,738",You created me. I didn't create some loser alter ego to make myself feel better.
"02:05:44,820","02:05:48,606",- Take some responsibility! - I do. I am responsible for all of it
"02:05:48,738","02:05:50,375",and I accept that.
"02:05:50,457","02:05:54,334","So, please, I'm begging you, please call this off."
"02:05:56,254","02:05:58,369",Have I ever let us down?
"02:05:59,732","02:06:01,961",How far have you come because of me?!
"02:06:07,608","02:06:09,598",I will bring us through this.
"02:06:09,687","02:06:13,314","As always, I will carry you kicking and screaming"
"02:06:13,405","02:06:15,713",and in the end you will thank me.
"02:06:16,203","02:06:18,591",Tyler. Tyler.
"02:06:18,682","02:06:22,070",I'm grateful to you. For everything that you've done for me.
"02:06:22,160","02:06:24,719",But this is too much. I don't want this.
"02:06:24,799","02:06:29,870",What do you want? Wanna go back to the shit job?
"02:06:29,956","02:06:31,946",Fuck you! I won't do it.
"02:06:32,755","02:06:36,428","- This can't be happening. - It's already done, so shut up!"
"02:06:36,513","02:06:38,070","Sixty seconds, can you see alright?"
"02:06:38,592","02:06:40,582",No.
"02:06:42,390","02:06:45,061",I can figure this out. I can figure this out. This is not for real.
"02:06:45,148","02:06:48,662","You're not real, that gun... That gun isn't even in your hand."
"02:06:50,106","02:06:52,096",The gun's in my hand.
"02:06:56,902","02:06:59,256","Hey, good for you. It doesn't change a thing."
"02:07:07,777","02:07:10,335",Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?
"02:07:10,415","02:07:12,405","Not my head, Tyler."
"02:07:12,974","02:07:14,929",Our head.
"02:07:16,372","02:07:18,362",Interesting.
"02:07:21,250","02:07:23,808","Where are you going with this, IKEA-boy?"
"02:07:30,005","02:07:32,882",Hey. It's you and me.
"02:07:35,482","02:07:37,472",Friends?
"02:07:38,281","02:07:40,271","Tyler,"
"02:07:43,558","02:07:45,832",I want you to really listen to me.
"02:07:45,917","02:07:48,271",OK.
"02:07:48,356","02:07:50,345",My eyes are open.
"02:08:08,305","02:08:10,260",What's that smell?
"02:08:29,054","02:08:31,931","- Where is everybody? - Oh, no. What's going on?"
"02:08:32,573","02:08:34,085",Mr. Durden!
"02:08:35,131","02:08:36,882","Oh, my God!"
"02:08:42,048","02:08:45,118","Are you... Are you all right, sir?"
"02:08:45,206","02:08:48,992","- Oh, yeah, I'm OK. - You look terrible, sir. What happened?"
"02:08:49,084","02:08:52,916","- Nothing, it's no problem. - No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding."
"02:08:53,002","02:08:55,640",- You look really awful. You need mediacl assistance.
"02:08:55,760","02:08:59,195","Look, I'm fine... Everything's fine."
"02:09:01,398","02:09:03,546",Stop it!
"02:09:03,636","02:09:06,627",- Let her go. - Christ Almighty!
"02:09:06,715","02:09:08,432",You!
"02:09:08,514","02:09:10,504","Hi, Marla."
"02:09:10,993","02:09:15,620",- Leave her with me. Get your stuff. Meet me downstairs.
"02:09:15,710","02:09:17,700","Yes, I'm sure."
"02:09:18,749","02:09:22,705",You fucker! What kind of sick fucking game are you playing at?!
"02:09:22,786","02:09:25,379","Putting me on a fucking... Oh, my God, your face!"
"02:09:25,465","02:09:26,897","Yeah, I know."
"02:09:31,462","02:09:33,292",What happened?
"02:09:33,381","02:09:35,416",- Don't ask. - You're shot.
"02:09:35,500","02:09:37,490","- Yes, I'm shot. - Oh, my God."
"02:09:38,378","02:09:41,289",- I can't believe he's standing. - One tough motherfucker.
"02:09:44,935","02:09:46,731",Who did this?
"02:09:46,814","02:09:49,202","I did, actually."
"02:09:49,293","02:09:51,283",Find some gauze.
"02:09:52,571","02:09:54,526",You shot yourself?
"02:09:54,610","02:09:57,169","Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me."
"02:09:57,249","02:09:59,397",I'm really OK.
"02:09:59,487","02:10:03,273",Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine.
"02:10:15,559","02:10:19,311",You met me at a very strange time in my life.
