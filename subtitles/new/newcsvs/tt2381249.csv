tt2381249,"00:01:11,138","00:01:12,598",Benji.
tt2381249,"00:01:12,850","00:01:14,800","Benji, do you copy?"
tt2381249,"00:01:15,294","00:01:16,909",Benji.
tt2381249,"00:01:17,314","00:01:19,341",Oh. Shit.
tt2381249,"00:01:19,366","00:01:20,808",Where's Ethan?
tt2381249,"00:01:20,833","00:01:22,488",Uh. I can't talk right now.
tt2381249,"00:01:22,513","00:01:24,919",The package is on the plane.
tt2381249,"00:01:24,944","00:01:26,514","Yeah, I know."
tt2381249,"00:01:26,539","00:01:30,442","We're currently formulate a plan B although technically, it's a plan C."
tt2381249,"00:01:30,467","00:01:31,840",This isn't going very well.
tt2381249,"00:01:31,880","00:01:34,165","I am aware of that, Brandt. You're not helping."
tt2381249,"00:01:34,189","00:01:35,299",Where's Ethan?
tt2381249,"00:01:35,324","00:01:36,777",I don't know. We're on radio silence.
tt2381249,"00:01:36,802","00:01:39,548","That plane cannot takeoff, with the package on it."
tt2381249,"00:01:39,573","00:01:41,672",- You understand? - We're working on it.
tt2381249,"00:01:41,704","00:01:43,779",Luther?  What the hell are you doing there?
tt2381249,"00:01:43,804","00:01:45,569",You are supposed to be on an assignment in Malaysia.
tt2381249,"00:01:45,594","00:01:48,621","I'm in Malaysia, I've been here 2 days. Benji needed my help."
tt2381249,"00:01:48,676","00:01:52,160","I didn't need help. I just- I needed assistance, it's a different thing."
tt2381249,"00:01:52,185","00:01:54,504",The package is still on that plane.
tt2381249,"00:01:55,875","00:01:57,663",We understand the package is on the plane.
tt2381249,"00:01:57,688","00:02:00,140",- We're trying to cripple it remotely. - You can do that.
tt2381249,"00:02:00,165","00:02:02,931",We can if the pilot left the satellite uplink switch on.
tt2381249,"00:02:02,956","00:02:05,305",- Which he has. - And how do you access the uplink?
tt2381249,"00:02:05,330","00:02:08,855",- It involves hacking a Russian satellite. - I can't authorise that.
tt2381249,"00:02:08,878","00:02:10,697",Which is why I didn't ask permission.
tt2381249,"00:02:10,722","00:02:13,178",We are under investigation for misconduct.
tt2381249,"00:02:13,203","00:02:16,599",The package is on-board. What do you want me to do?
tt2381249,"00:02:24,549","00:02:26,436",Uh. Luther.
tt2381249,"00:02:26,461","00:02:29,111","I'm reading a heat bloom, Benji. The engines are starting."
tt2381249,"00:02:29,136","00:02:30,695",Yeah. I'm aware of that.
tt2381249,"00:02:30,720","00:02:34,233",But I can't do anything until I'm connected to the satellite.
tt2381249,"00:02:34,522","00:02:37,401","Benji, you are connected. - Okay, Great."
tt2381249,"00:02:38,050","00:02:40,804",The package is still on that plane.
tt2381249,"00:02:40,829","00:02:42,710",Shut down the fuel pump.
tt2381249,"00:02:42,735","00:02:44,561",Uh. Mechanical are lockdown.
tt2381249,"00:02:44,625","00:02:47,746","- What about the electrical system? - Oh, that might work."
tt2381249,"00:02:47,771","00:02:48,556",No. No.
tt2381249,"00:02:48,581","00:02:50,440","- Hydraulics. - Okay, standby."
tt2381249,"00:02:50,465","00:02:52,450","No, they're encrypted."
tt2381249,"00:02:53,929","00:02:55,002","Benji, the plane."
tt2381249,"00:02:55,027","00:02:56,740",Yes! The package is on the plane!
tt2381249,"00:02:56,765","00:02:58,625",We get it!
tt2381249,"00:03:00,158","00:03:02,167",Can you open the door?
tt2381249,"00:03:02,192","00:03:04,535",- Ethan? Where are you? - I'm by the plane.
tt2381249,"00:03:04,560","00:03:06,472","Benji, can you open the door?"
tt2381249,"00:03:06,497","00:03:09,226",Uh. Can I open the door? Uh. Maybe.
tt2381249,"00:03:09,251","00:03:11,763",Open the door when I tell you.
tt2381249,"00:03:25,760","00:03:27,572",I'm on the plane. Open the door.
tt2381249,"00:03:27,597","00:03:28,737",How did you get in the plane?
tt2381249,"00:03:28,762","00:03:31,506","Not in the plane, I'm on the plane!"
tt2381249,"00:03:31,531","00:03:33,798",Open the door!
tt2381249,"00:03:37,891","00:03:40,359",Benji. Open the door!
tt2381249,"00:03:40,384","00:03:42,915","Yeah-yeah-yeah... Okay, okay."
tt2381249,"00:03:47,185","00:03:50,690","- Benji, open that door right now! - Yeah, I am trying."
tt2381249,"00:04:04,457","00:04:07,260","- Come on, Benji. - Benji, open that door!"
tt2381249,"00:04:07,285","00:04:09,673",Come on. Come on. Come on.
tt2381249,"00:04:15,172","00:04:18,287","Come on. Yes, got it."
tt2381249,"00:04:22,657","00:04:24,510",That's the wrong door!
tt2381249,"00:04:24,535","00:04:26,796","Benji, not that door. The other door."
tt2381249,"00:04:26,821","00:04:28,619","The other door. Right. Yes, the other door."
tt2381249,"00:04:28,644","00:04:31,852","Okay, yes, yes.  Sorry, sorry. My bad, my bad."
tt2381249,"00:04:36,888","00:04:38,548",Check it out.
tt2381249,"00:04:38,744","00:04:40,767","Alright. Look, I'm gonna open the para-door."
tt2381249,"00:04:40,792","00:04:42,617",How's that?
tt2381249,"00:05:11,206","00:05:13,221",Hey. Hey.
tt2381249,"00:05:59,003","00:06:01,604",LONDON ENGLAND
tt2381249,"00:06:28,247","00:06:30,063",We're about to close.
tt2381249,"00:06:30,088","00:06:31,933",I won't be long.
tt2381249,"00:06:31,958","00:06:34,613",You looking for anything in particular.
tt2381249,"00:06:35,242","00:06:37,770",Something rare.
tt2381249,"00:06:41,102","00:06:43,063",Let me guess.
tt2381249,"00:06:44,308","00:06:46,028",Classical.
tt2381249,"00:06:46,053","00:06:47,053",Jazz.
tt2381249,"00:06:47,078","00:06:49,195",- Sax. - Coltrain.
tt2381249,"00:06:49,220","00:06:51,391",- Piano. - Monk.
tt2381249,"00:06:51,416","00:06:53,962",Shadow Wilson on the bass.
tt2381249,"00:06:53,987","00:06:56,748",Shadow Wilson played drums.
tt2381249,"00:06:57,192","00:06:59,840",Know why they called him Shadow?
tt2381249,"00:06:59,865","00:07:02,543",Because he had a light touch.
tt2381249,"00:07:03,201","00:07:05,036",You're in luck.
tt2381249,"00:07:06,477","00:07:08,804",I've a first pressing.
tt2381249,"00:07:16,875","00:07:19,158",It really is you.
tt2381249,"00:07:21,719","00:07:23,859",I've heard stories.
tt2381249,"00:07:24,091","00:07:26,325",They can't all be true.
tt2381249,"00:07:47,970","00:07:49,752","Good even, Mr. Hunt."
tt2381249,"00:07:49,777","00:07:53,502",The weapons you recovered in Belarus were confirmed to be VX nerve gas.
tt2381249,"00:07:53,527","00:07:56,250",Capable of devastating a major city.
tt2381249,"00:07:56,275","00:07:58,121",The bodies of the air crew were found less than
tt2381249,"00:07:58,146","00:08:01,038",24 hours after they landed in Damascus.
tt2381249,"00:08:01,063","00:08:04,080",They were identified as low level Chechen separatist.
tt2381249,"00:08:04,105","00:08:05,978",With neither the access nor the ability
tt2381249,"00:08:06,003","00:08:09,116",to acquire the weapons they were transporting.
tt2381249,"00:08:09,141","00:08:10,859",This would support your suspicion
tt2381249,"00:08:10,884","00:08:14,110",that a shadow organization is committed to inciting revolution.
tt2381249,"00:08:14,134","00:08:18,319",by enabling acts of terror in nations friendly to Western interests.
tt2381249,"00:08:18,345","00:08:21,322",IMF suspects this to be the same shadow organization
tt2381249,"00:08:21,347","00:08:23,605",you have been tracking for the last year
tt2381249,"00:08:23,630","00:08:25,993",Also known as the Syndicate.
tt2381249,"00:08:26,018","00:08:28,397",IMF would be right.
tt2381249,"00:08:28,422","00:08:30,671","Normally, you and your team would be tasked"
tt2381249,"00:08:30,696","00:08:33,662","with infiltrating and disrupting this terrorist network,"
tt2381249,"00:08:33,687","00:08:37,338",but we have taken steps to ensure that this will not happen.
tt2381249,"00:08:37,363","00:08:40,022","Because, we, are the Syndicate, Mr. Hunt."
tt2381249,"00:08:40,047","00:08:42,734",And now we know who you are.
tt2381249,"00:08:42,759","00:08:45,059","Your mission, should you choose to accept it,"
tt2381249,"00:08:45,084","00:08:46,709",is to face your fate.
tt2381249,"00:08:46,734","00:08:50,891","Pursue us, you'll be caught. Resist us, you'll be killed."
tt2381249,"00:08:50,916","00:08:55,065",And you precious Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions.
tt2381249,"00:08:55,090","00:08:56,409","Good luck, Mr. Hunt."
tt2381249,"00:08:56,434","00:09:00,625",This message will self destruct in 5 seconds.
tt2381249,"00:09:50,248","00:09:55,148","Mr. Chairman, the IMF's misadventures date back to my earliest days in the CIA"
tt2381249,"00:09:55,187","00:09:59,829",when the IMF broke into the CIA to steal a list of covert operatives.
tt2381249,"00:09:59,854","00:10:02,840","- And now, more recently a Russian warhead. - Disarmed Russian warhead."
tt2381249,"00:10:02,865","00:10:05,658",- A Russian nuclear warhead. - Branded safe by Th IMF.
tt2381249,"00:10:05,683","00:10:09,074",Clipped the Transamerica Pyramid before plunging into the San Francisco bay.
tt2381249,"00:10:09,099","00:10:10,613",Saving the western atmosphere.
tt2381249,"00:10:10,638","00:10:13,168",This made possible by IMF agents who did willing
tt2381249,"00:10:13,193","00:10:16,304",provide the launch codes to a known terrorist.
tt2381249,"00:10:16,329","00:10:19,175","Do I have that right, agent Brandt?"
tt2381249,"00:10:19,705","00:10:23,890",I can neither confirm nor deny details of any such operation without Secretary's approval.
tt2381249,"00:10:23,924","00:10:26,836",This was the same week after IMF infiltrated the Kremlin.
tt2381249,"00:10:26,861","00:10:29,327",Here's the Kremlin before.
tt2381249,"00:10:30,184","00:10:32,823",And the Kremlin after.
tt2381249,"00:10:34,698","00:10:37,477",I can neither confirm nor deny details of any operation...
tt2381249,"00:10:37,502","00:10:39,256","Without the Secretary's approval. Yes, we know."
tt2381249,"00:10:39,281","00:10:41,779","In fact, until this panel appoints a new Secretary,"
tt2381249,"00:10:41,804","00:10:44,221","you really can't say much of anything, can you, agent Brandt?"
tt2381249,"00:10:44,246","00:10:45,785","Well. I didn't write the rules, Mr. Hunley."
tt2381249,"00:10:45,810","00:10:48,528","Mr. Chairman, the so call Impossible Missions Force"
tt2381249,"00:10:48,568","00:10:52,008","is not just a rogue organization, it is an outdated one."
tt2381249,"00:10:52,034","00:10:55,905",A throwback to an era without transparency and without oversight.
tt2381249,"00:10:55,930","00:10:58,336",- Mr. Chairman. - The time has come to dissolve the IMF.
tt2381249,"00:10:58,361","00:11:02,504",- Mr. Chairman. - And transfer the salvageable assets to the CIA.
tt2381249,"00:11:02,529","00:11:05,827","Mr. Chairman, the IMF has operated without oversight for 40 years."
tt2381249,"00:11:05,852","00:11:08,266","- Now, are its methods unorthodox? Yes. - Mr. Chairman."
tt2381249,"00:11:08,291","00:11:11,451",Are it's results less than perfect? Absolutely.
tt2381249,"00:11:11,490","00:11:14,059","- But without the IMF, to be force... - There'll be order and stability."
tt2381249,"00:11:14,084","00:11:16,247",Without the IMF...
tt2381249,"00:11:17,398","00:11:22,551",This panel recognizes the IMF's contribution to global security.
tt2381249,"00:11:22,576","00:11:25,874",But the events laid out by CIA director Hunley
tt2381249,"00:11:25,903","00:11:28,929",also show a pattern of once and brinkmanship
tt2381249,"00:11:28,954","00:11:31,860",and a total disregard for protocol.
tt2381249,"00:11:31,885","00:11:33,106","From where I sit,"
tt2381249,"00:11:33,131","00:11:37,100",you unorthodox methods are indistinguishable from chance.
tt2381249,"00:11:37,125","00:11:40,204","And your results, perfect or not,"
tt2381249,"00:11:40,229","00:11:42,948",looked suspiciously like luck.
tt2381249,"00:11:43,624","00:11:48,750",I'm afraid today is the day when the IMF's luck runs out.
tt2381249,"00:13:27,681","00:13:29,559",What are you doing here?
tt2381249,"00:13:30,274","00:13:31,619",Huh?
tt2381249,"00:13:34,351","00:13:37,298","I said: ""What are you doing here?"""
tt2381249,"00:13:44,555","00:13:47,694","What does he see in you, I wonder."
tt2381249,"00:13:48,023","00:13:49,657",Who is he?
tt2381249,"00:13:53,320","00:13:56,045",I want to see what is done.
tt2381249,"00:13:57,185","00:13:59,511",Why don't you take off the cuffs.
tt2381249,"00:13:59,536","00:14:01,683",And I'll show you.
tt2381249,"00:14:01,708","00:14:03,481",Vinter.
tt2381249,"00:14:06,862","00:14:08,831",You know who I am?
tt2381249,"00:14:08,856","00:14:10,930",Janik Vinter.
tt2381249,"00:14:11,541","00:14:14,947","They call you, the bone doctor."
tt2381249,"00:14:16,070","00:14:18,139",The funny thing is.
tt2381249,"00:14:18,164","00:14:22,272","You're officially declared dead, 3 years ago."
tt2381249,"00:14:22,297","00:14:24,456",Nice shoes by the way.
tt2381249,"00:14:25,942","00:14:27,795",Not his.
tt2381249,"00:14:28,005","00:14:29,720",Yours.
tt2381249,"00:14:36,156","00:14:38,722","We have instructions to talk,"
tt2381249,"00:14:38,747","00:14:40,193",not to kill him.
tt2381249,"00:14:40,218","00:14:43,342",There are men who are broken in different ways.
tt2381249,"00:14:44,838","00:14:46,862",This one's a fighter.
tt2381249,"00:14:46,887","00:14:49,486","He'll die, before you turn him."
tt2381249,"00:14:49,511","00:14:52,283",Are you worry he's gonna take your place?

tt2381249,"00:15:09,493","00:15:11,929","Yeah, he's right."
tt2381249,"00:15:11,954","00:15:13,975",You should go.
tt2381249,"00:15:27,587","00:15:30,841","Now, let's see how tough you are."
tt2381249,"00:15:32,011","00:15:33,981","You, Janik."
tt2381249,"00:16:56,482","00:16:59,177","We've never met before, right?"
tt2381249,"00:17:00,910","00:17:02,707",Follow me.
tt2381249,"00:17:10,671","00:17:12,434",Give me the gun.
tt2381249,"00:17:15,695","00:17:18,569",- What're you doing? - I can't leave.
tt2381249,"00:17:18,594","00:17:20,662",Look. You can't stay. We just killed those men.
tt2381249,"00:17:20,687","00:17:22,868",We didn't kill them. You did.
tt2381249,"00:17:22,893","00:17:26,476",I tried to stop you. You got away.
tt2381249,"00:17:27,694","00:17:29,611",Who are you?
tt2381249,"00:17:29,636","00:17:32,750",You better hurry now. Good luck.

tt2381249,"00:17:34,466","00:17:35,596",Where is he?
tt2381249,"00:17:35,621","00:17:38,109",He's heading to the north corridor. He has closed the gate.
tt2381249,"00:17:38,134","00:17:41,304","Hurry, don't let him escape. Quick!"

tt2381249,"00:18:28,312","00:18:31,028",I think I know why they've been so hard to find.
tt2381249,"00:18:31,053","00:18:36,188",Just focus operations on gathering any available Intel regarding formal covert operatives.

tt2381249,"00:18:38,273","00:18:40,713",Just as long as they are dead Or presumed dead.
tt2381249,"00:18:40,738","00:18:45,498",Start with Janik Vinter. He's also known as the bone doctor.

tt2381249,"00:18:47,834","00:18:49,845",What're you talking about?

tt2381249,"00:19:05,033","00:19:06,994",We didn't have this conversation.
tt2381249,"00:19:07,019","00:19:10,155",I disappeared in London. You don't know where I am.
tt2381249,"00:19:10,180","00:19:11,743",If I'm dead or alive.
tt2381249,"00:19:11,768","00:19:14,295",This man you saw. Can you find him?
tt2381249,"00:19:15,489","00:19:18,394",I won't stop until I do.
tt2381249,"00:19:18,768","00:19:21,787","This may very well be our last mission, Ethan."
tt2381249,"00:19:21,812","00:19:23,447",Make it count.
tt2381249,"00:19:23,472","00:19:25,165",Brandt.
tt2381249,"00:19:44,311","00:19:45,687","Since we are going to be work together,"
tt2381249,"00:19:45,712","00:19:48,370",I want you to choose your next works very carefully.

tt2381249,"00:19:49,537","00:19:51,462","- I don't know. - Don't lie to me, Brandt."
tt2381249,"00:19:51,487","00:19:53,243",I have no way of contacting him.
tt2381249,"00:19:53,268","00:19:56,073","He's deep cover. Last I heard, he's tracking the Syndicate."
tt2381249,"00:19:56,098","00:19:57,405",Let's cut the bull.
tt2381249,"00:19:57,430","00:20:00,452",You know who we are. You know what we are capable of.
tt2381249,"00:20:00,477","00:20:05,290",How come the CIA has never discovered any actual Intel regarding this Syndicate.
tt2381249,"00:20:05,315","00:20:07,971","- What are you implying? - Not implying, stating."
tt2381249,"00:20:07,996","00:20:10,259",Leveling an accusation actually.
tt2381249,"00:20:10,284","00:20:13,870",Hunt is both arsonist and fireman at the same time.
tt2381249,"00:20:13,895","00:20:16,502",I believe that the Syndicate is a figment of his imagination.
tt2381249,"00:20:16,527","00:20:19,809",Created to justify the IMF's existence.
tt2381249,"00:20:19,834","00:20:22,183","I'm going to find him, Brandt. And when I do,"
tt2381249,"00:20:22,208","00:20:28,600",he will be called upon to answer for every wanton active mayhem he's responsible for.
tt2381249,"00:20:30,221","00:20:32,640",Welcome to the CIA.
tt2381249,"00:20:34,212","00:20:35,611",You'll never find him.
tt2381249,"00:20:35,636","00:20:37,481","Set your watch, Brandt."

tt2381249,"00:23:30,222","00:23:31,895",I know and I'm gonna answer truthfully.
tt2381249,"00:23:31,920","00:23:34,456",And then you gonna ask me to lie intentionally.

tt2381249,"00:23:48,273","00:23:52,229",He... left these behind.
tt2381249,"00:23:52,504","00:23:54,636",Tell me what you make of them.
tt2381249,"00:23:54,938","00:23:56,639",I don't know. He's taken up scrap booking?
tt2381249,"00:23:56,664","00:23:58,542","Look at the photographs, Dunn."
tt2381249,"00:23:58,567","00:24:01,432","All of them are either missing or dead, everyone."

tt2381249,"00:24:09,411","00:24:12,459",And he always seems to be a step ahead of us.
tt2381249,"00:24:12,484","00:24:14,846",- I wonder how? - Are you suggesting I'm helping him?
tt2381249,"00:24:14,871","00:24:17,070",That thought had cross my mind.

tt2381249,"00:24:26,947","00:24:28,888","And yet every week, you hold me in here."
tt2381249,"00:24:28,913","00:24:31,866","And you ask me the same question, just in a different way."
tt2381249,"00:24:31,891","00:24:35,414","And today, you haven't answered it."
tt2381249,"00:24:37,148","00:24:41,019",You seem to thinks I have some kind of obligation to him.
tt2381249,"00:24:41,044","00:24:43,639","Okay, nothing could be further from the truth."
tt2381249,"00:24:43,664","00:24:50,376","Ethan Hunt is still out there in the field, and I'm stuck here answering for it"
tt2381249,"00:24:50,478","00:24:52,867",We're not friends.
tt2381249,"00:24:54,543","00:24:56,846",I owe him nothing.
tt2381249,"00:25:01,397","00:25:03,922","That'll be all, Dunn."

tt2381249,"00:26:08,803","00:26:11,769",because it's just another thing I would have to lie about in my weekly polygraph.
tt2381249,"00:26:11,794","00:26:13,991",Everything is going to be fine. Just keep walking.
tt2381249,"00:26:14,016","00:26:16,355","But, make sure you're not being follow.ed"
tt2381249,"00:26:16,380","00:26:19,594","- Oh. I didn't win those opera tickets, did I? - No, I'm afraid not"
tt2381249,"00:26:19,619","00:26:21,293","- So, where do we meet? - We don't."
tt2381249,"00:26:21,318","00:26:24,167","For your sake, we shouldn't be seen together."
tt2381249,"00:26:24,192","00:26:25,783",You have mail.
tt2381249,"00:26:26,831","00:26:28,743",- Who is he? - That's what we're here to find out.
tt2381249,"00:26:28,799","00:26:31,916","What I do know, is he's our only possible link to the Syndicate"
tt2381249,"00:26:32,518","00:26:34,915",and I have reason to believe that he's going to be here tonight.
tt2381249,"00:26:34,940","00:26:38,131",But I can't find him alone. Are you in?
tt2381249,"00:26:38,156","00:26:41,486","- Are you in? - Yes, of course. Of course."
tt2381249,"00:26:41,511","00:26:44,978","- So, what's the play? - Simple. You find him, we tag him."
tt2381249,"00:26:45,003","00:26:47,902",- I follow him wherever he goes. - And after that?
tt2381249,"00:26:47,927","00:26:50,985","After that you're on a plane, back at work Monday morning."
tt2381249,"00:26:51,010","00:26:54,321",- No one is the wiser. - What? That's it?
tt2381249,"00:26:54,346","00:26:55,916",You're in enough danger as it is.
tt2381249,"00:26:55,941","00:26:58,533",I didn't want to involve you this much but I had no choice.
tt2381249,"00:26:58,558","00:27:00,351","Whoa. If you're gonna bring me all this way,"
tt2381249,"00:27:00,376","00:27:03,951","you could at least give me something a little be more...you know, dramatic."
tt2381249,"00:27:03,976","00:27:06,957","Benji, we are trying to keep a low profile."
tt2381249,"00:27:06,982","00:27:10,640","You want drama, go to the opera."
tt2381249,"00:27:38,287","00:27:42,285","- Are you seeing what I'm seeing? - Yes, I am."
tt2381249,"00:27:48,346","00:27:51,635",Am I correct in assuming that is the Chancellor of Austria?
tt2381249,"00:27:51,660","00:27:55,162","- Yes, you are. - Did you know he's going to be here?"
tt2381249,"00:27:55,187","00:27:56,846",- No - Right.
tt2381249,"00:27:56,871","00:27:59,194","Well. We have a European Heads of State here,"
tt2381249,"00:27:59,219","00:28:02,731",at the same time as we're looking for a nefarious terrorist.
tt2381249,"00:28:02,756","00:28:06,294",- And I'm sure the two things are completely unrelated. - Benji.
tt2381249,"00:28:06,319","00:28:11,244",- Mean while I'll try and overlook the fact that you're an international fugitive wanted by the CIA. - Benji.
tt2381249,"00:28:11,269","00:28:14,828",- And this little unsanctioned operation is tenement-ed treasonous. - Benji.
tt2381249,"00:28:14,853","00:28:16,173","Because as you stated earlier,"
tt2381249,"00:28:16,198","00:28:18,011","I will be back in my desk on Monday morning,"
tt2381249,"00:28:18,036","00:28:20,931",playing video games and no one will be any be the wiser.
tt2381249,"00:28:20,956","00:28:22,682","- The show's about to start, Benji. - Right."
tt2381249,"00:28:22,707","00:28:25,548","- Just take your position, tell me what you see. - Okay."
tt2381249,"00:28:25,573","00:28:27,878","Nice tux, by the way."

tt2381249,"00:31:44,504","00:31:47,161","Uh Ethan, I might have something for you. Can't confirm."
tt2381249,"00:31:47,186","00:31:50,014","- Where? - Backstage, I will direct you"
tt2381249,"00:31:56,977","00:32:01,337",Take the door on your left. He should be right in front of you.
tt2381249,"00:32:42,089","00:32:45,072","Benji, did you see that? - See what?"
tt2381249,"00:32:45,689","00:32:46,782",A woman.
tt2381249,"00:32:46,807","00:32:48,559",What woman? Where're you?
tt2381249,"00:32:48,584","00:32:50,464",I can't see you.
tt2381249,"00:35:07,905","00:35:11,323",- What happened? - I don't know
tt2381249,"00:35:24,291","00:35:27,191","Ethan, do you copy? Ethan, come in."
tt2381249,"00:37:48,380","00:37:51,721","Ethan, the lighting booth. Ethan, do you copy?"
tt2381249,"00:37:51,746","00:37:53,242",Oh god.
tt2381249,"00:39:18,979","00:39:21,192",It's a flash wound.
tt2381249,"00:39:55,801","00:39:58,234","Sorry, ladies and gentlemen."
tt2381249,"00:40:02,881","00:40:06,517",Surround the building. Secure the exits.
tt2381249,"00:40:08,207","00:40:12,088",I've a way out. Interested?
tt2381249,"00:40:13,133","00:40:14,930",Lead the way.
tt2381249,"00:40:22,835","00:40:26,213","- Anything you want to tell me? - No, not right now."
tt2381249,"00:40:26,238","00:40:29,426",- How's the pace? - Don't wait for me.
tt2381249,"00:40:37,239","00:40:39,164",What's next?
tt2381249,"00:40:40,491","00:40:42,029",Alright.
tt2381249,"00:40:42,525","00:40:43,918",There.
tt2381249,"00:40:51,619","00:40:53,344",Shoes.
tt2381249,"00:40:53,471","00:40:55,605","Shoes, please."
tt2381249,"00:41:51,468","00:41:52,794",If anything happens to you...
tt2381249,"00:41:52,819","00:41:55,645",Nothing is going to happen to me.
tt2381249,"00:41:56,033","00:41:57,955",Stop the car!
tt2381249,"00:42:05,843","00:42:07,527",Get in.
tt2381249,"00:42:09,132","00:42:10,941",Go go go.
tt2381249,"00:42:18,535","00:42:21,211",What the...! She tried to shoot me.
tt2381249,"00:42:21,236","00:42:23,909",It doesn't make her a bad person.
tt2381249,"00:42:24,026","00:42:26,654",- I'm gonna have to search you. - You have to let me go.
tt2381249,"00:42:26,679","00:42:28,198",Oh oh. Not a chance.
tt2381249,"00:42:28,223","00:42:31,858",I assume you're deep cover back in London but isn't this taking the role a little too far.
tt2381249,"00:42:31,883","00:42:33,060","Hang on a minute, you know her?"
tt2381249,"00:42:33,085","00:42:35,187",Oh. We haven't formerly introduced.
tt2381249,"00:42:35,212","00:42:37,605",But I am pretty sure she's British intelligence.
tt2381249,"00:42:37,630","00:42:40,566",Ilsa Faust. You're Ethan Hunt.
tt2381249,"00:42:40,591","00:42:44,558",And... that shade is very hard to find.
tt2381249,"00:42:44,594","00:42:47,741",- What were you doing at the opera tonight? - What? Aside from killing the Chancellor.
tt2381249,"00:42:47,766","00:42:51,923",Saving your life in London put me in a tight spot with some very dangerous people.
tt2381249,"00:42:51,948","00:42:54,418",I was sent to kill the Chancellor to regain their trust.
tt2381249,"00:42:54,443","00:42:56,135","Ha. So, you admit that you killed him?"
tt2381249,"00:42:56,160","00:42:59,301","I went through the motion, that's not the same thing."
tt2381249,"00:42:59,326","00:43:02,367","You thought you put him in the hospital, take him out of harm's way."
tt2381249,"00:43:02,392","00:43:04,081",The same thing you tried to do.
tt2381249,"00:43:04,106","00:43:06,530","You're not gonna believe that, are you? What about the rest of her team?"
tt2381249,"00:43:06,555","00:43:10,407",You means those other 2 idiots? I can only assumed they were redundancies.
tt2381249,"00:43:10,432","00:43:14,472","In case you didn't follow through. One man to kill the Chancellor,"
tt2381249,"00:43:14,540","00:43:17,111",the other one to kill you. A test.
tt2381249,"00:43:17,136","00:43:19,093","Second one I failed, thanks to you."
tt2381249,"00:43:19,141","00:43:22,528",And the car bomb was insurance.
tt2381249,"00:43:26,370","00:43:28,473",We have a tail.
tt2381249,"00:43:29,780","00:43:31,620",Who is he?
tt2381249,"00:43:31,645","00:43:33,802","We're after the same thing, and I can help you."
tt2381249,"00:43:33,827","00:43:36,720","If you want to bring down the Syndicate, you've to let me out."
tt2381249,"00:43:36,745","00:43:38,750",They're closing.
tt2381249,"00:43:39,631","00:43:42,256","This has to look like an escape. So, you just throw me out anywhere."
tt2381249,"00:43:42,281","00:43:44,741",Tell me who he is.
tt2381249,"00:43:44,766","00:43:46,073",Oh!
tt2381249,"00:43:46,856","00:43:49,705",Oh. Change of plan. Throw her out!
tt2381249,"00:43:51,386","00:43:53,993",You have everything you need to find me.
tt2381249,"00:44:09,467","00:44:13,453",Less than 24 hours after we interviewed Benji Dunn about Ethan Hunt
tt2381249,"00:44:13,478","00:44:16,005",He was on a plane to Vienna with tickets to the opera.
tt2381249,"00:44:16,033","00:44:19,305","And within 6 hours of his arrival, the Chancellor was dead."
tt2381249,"00:44:19,330","00:44:21,772","Now, that might be circumstance to some public defendant."
tt2381249,"00:44:21,797","00:44:24,922","But to the CIA, that is actionable intelligence."
tt2381249,"00:44:24,923","00:44:29,433","Consider the moment, the possibility that Ethan's investigation lead him to the opera."
tt2381249,"00:44:29,458","00:44:31,129",And he's the one with the actionable intelligence.
tt2381249,"00:44:31,130","00:44:35,274",In any case. Finding Hunt is no longer our pet project.
tt2381249,"00:44:35,314","00:44:39,568",The Special Activity Division will now have full discretion.
tt2381249,"00:44:40,206","00:44:41,605",You mean shoot to kill?
tt2381249,"00:44:41,630","00:44:46,287",Whether Hunt lives or dies. It's entirely up to him.
tt2381249,"00:45:45,790","00:45:49,195","New identity, passport, cash, road map."
tt2381249,"00:45:49,228","00:45:50,798","There's a change of clothes in that bag, right there."
tt2381249,"00:45:50,823","00:45:53,678",Everything you need to make it to DC undetected.
tt2381249,"00:45:53,703","00:45:56,461","Once you're there, you'll have to inform on me."
tt2381249,"00:45:56,486","00:45:58,323","- I'm suppose... what? Sorry, what? - Tell the truth."
tt2381249,"00:45:58,324","00:46:01,279",You came to Vienna believing you won 2 tickets to the opera.
tt2381249,"00:46:01,304","00:46:04,658","And I attempted to recruit you into assassinating the Chancellor, you refused."
tt2381249,"00:46:04,683","00:46:07,824","- That is not the true. - Your life depends on them believing you, Benji."
tt2381249,"00:46:07,849","00:46:10,261",It'll go easier if you tell them what they want to hear.
tt2381249,"00:46:10,286","00:46:13,924","Ethan, at least tell me what this is all about."
tt2381249,"00:46:22,059","00:46:24,385",You recognized anyone?
tt2381249,"00:46:36,587","00:46:39,945","- Him. - He's former KSA, German intelligence."
tt2381249,"00:46:39,970","00:46:42,127","Missing, presumed dead."
tt2381249,"00:46:42,475","00:46:44,423",He was at the opera tonight.
tt2381249,"00:46:44,448","00:46:45,996",This one too.
tt2381249,"00:46:46,021","00:46:49,461",- Former Mossad. - Let me guess. Presumed dead.
tt2381249,"00:46:49,568","00:46:52,025","Tonight, I made it official."
tt2381249,"00:46:52,938","00:46:55,318",I was looking for him in Bosporus.
tt2381249,"00:46:55,343","00:46:59,378",The same day a car accident killed the visiting President of Malawi.
tt2381249,"00:47:00,051","00:47:02,827",He slipped away again in Jakarta.
tt2381249,"00:47:02,940","00:47:05,970",Hours before a passenger plane vanished over the Pacific
tt2381249,"00:47:05,995","00:47:08,782",with 236 passengers.
tt2381249,"00:47:09,417","00:47:11,364",I just missed him in the Philippines.
tt2381249,"00:47:11,389","00:47:16,487","Right before a fired petrochemical plant gassed a village of 2,000 people."
tt2381249,"00:47:18,261","00:47:21,405",You're saying these accidents are somehow connected.
tt2381249,"00:47:22,300","00:47:26,424",That missing plane was carrying the Secretary of the World Bank.
tt2381249,"00:47:27,340","00:47:30,946",That fire bank corrupted a global arms cooperation.
tt2381249,"00:47:31,553","00:47:34,454",That wreck triggered a civil war.
tt2381249,"00:47:35,793","00:47:38,027",These are no accidents.
tt2381249,"00:47:38,127","00:47:43,457","They're links in a chain. The work of a single organization, the Syndicate."
tt2381249,"00:47:43,597","00:47:44,867",A rogue nation.
tt2381249,"00:47:44,892","00:47:47,996",Trained to do what we do. Inbuilt with a new sense of purpose.
tt2381249,"00:47:48,021","00:47:50,350",Destroy the system that created them.
tt2381249,"00:47:50,375","00:47:52,931",Regardless if who's in the way.
tt2381249,"00:47:53,424","00:47:55,756",An anti-IMF.
tt2381249,"00:47:55,781","00:47:59,453","And since Hunley shut us down, they've been escalating unchecked."
tt2381249,"00:47:59,478","00:48:02,179",Killing the Chancellor tonight was a statement
tt2381249,"00:48:02,203","00:48:04,326",The start of a new phase.
tt2381249,"00:48:04,351","00:48:08,727",Or they could just be a series of random disasters.
tt2381249,"00:48:09,635","00:48:11,924",He was there.
tt2381249,"00:48:12,134","00:48:13,284",Everytime.
tt2381249,"00:48:13,309","00:48:16,421",Just like he was there tonight. I'm sure of it.
tt2381249,"00:48:16,727","00:48:20,098","I don't know who he is, where he's from."
tt2381249,"00:48:20,275","00:48:22,238",How he's funded
tt2381249,"00:48:22,263","00:48:24,374",But I know he's the key.
tt2381249,"00:48:24,399","00:48:26,914","Ethan, this is what I sign up for."
tt2381249,"00:48:26,939","00:48:29,262",- Let me help you find him. - That's why I brought you here.
tt2381249,"00:48:29,287","00:48:31,704",In the first place. And look what happened.
tt2381249,"00:48:31,729","00:48:33,508",I can't protect you.
tt2381249,"00:48:33,533","00:48:35,489",That's why I need you to leave.
tt2381249,"00:48:35,514","00:48:38,744","It's not your decision to make, Ethan."
tt2381249,"00:48:38,769","00:48:40,355",I'm a field agent.
tt2381249,"00:48:40,380","00:48:43,227","I know the risks. More than that, I'm your friend."
tt2381249,"00:48:43,252","00:48:45,169",No matter what I... con a polygraph every week.
tt2381249,"00:48:45,194","00:48:48,250",Now you called me because you needed my help.
tt2381249,"00:48:48,275","00:48:51,482","And you still do. So, I'm staying."
tt2381249,"00:48:51,507","00:48:54,229",And that's all we're gonna say about that.
tt2381249,"00:48:58,171","00:49:01,635",- Okay - Good
tt2381249,"00:49:03,155","00:49:05,139",Where do we start?
tt2381249,"00:49:06,497","00:49:08,145",Ilsa.
tt2381249,"00:49:10,194","00:49:12,838",Right. And how do we find her?
tt2381249,"00:49:12,863","00:49:15,297",She said we've everything we need.
tt2381249,"00:49:54,770","00:49:56,909",We had an agreement.
tt2381249,"00:49:56,934","00:49:58,785","You send me to do a job, I'd do it."
tt2381249,"00:49:58,810","00:50:01,763","- But my way, not yours. - When did I deviate?"
tt2381249,"00:50:01,788","00:50:03,949",You put 2 more gunman at the opera tonight.
tt2381249,"00:50:03,974","00:50:05,596",One of them try to kill me.
tt2381249,"00:50:05,621","00:50:06,739",You missed.
tt2381249,"00:50:06,764","00:50:09,361",I missed because Ethan Hunt was there looking for you.
tt2381249,"00:50:09,386","00:50:12,862",Ethan Hunt is in Vienna because you allow him escape in London.
tt2381249,"00:50:12,887","00:50:17,020",Vinter would've kill him in London and that's not what you asked for.
tt2381249,"00:50:17,045","00:50:19,870",Twice now you've let him slipped away.
tt2381249,"00:50:21,184","00:50:22,569",Curious.
tt2381249,"00:50:22,594","00:50:26,070",Are you questioning my loyalty or my ability.
tt2381249,"00:50:26,999","00:50:29,207",- Can't decide. - I've told you before.
tt2381249,"00:50:29,232","00:50:31,425",Trust me or kill me.
tt2381249,"00:50:31,450","00:50:34,433","But If you're going to kill me, be the man."
tt2381249,"00:50:35,480","00:50:37,727",Do it yourself.
tt2381249,"00:51:05,290","00:51:07,626",Did he say anything?
tt2381249,"00:51:08,545","00:51:13,389",- He knows about Morocco. - What did he know about Morocco?
tt2381249,"00:51:13,414","00:51:17,778",He knows about the power plant. He doesn't know what's in it.
tt2381249,"00:51:19,090","00:51:21,268","Find him, please."
tt2381249,"00:51:22,009","00:51:23,898",He'll find me.
tt2381249,"00:51:24,628","00:51:26,910",I've him seen to that.
tt2381249,"00:51:31,556","00:51:33,664","- Well, that's interesting - What is it?"
tt2381249,"00:51:33,689","00:51:37,400","It's a SCIF. Secure Computer Facility offline, ultra-contained."
tt2381249,"00:51:37,425","00:51:39,541",It's impossible to hack in from the outside.
tt2381249,"00:51:39,542","00:51:42,086",It's essentially a digital safety deposit box.
tt2381249,"00:51:42,111","00:51:45,778",Very strange thing for a young lady to be carrying in her sundries.
tt2381249,"00:51:45,803","00:51:50,164",- Where's it located? - Morocco.
tt2381249,"00:51:51,385","00:51:53,239",Morocco.
tt2381249,"00:51:54,767","00:51:57,928",CASABLANCA MOROCCO
tt2381249,"00:53:08,480","00:53:12,246","Now, what brings you gentlemen to Casablanca?"
tt2381249,"00:53:41,778","00:53:45,959",- Good to see you - What couldn't you tell me over the telephone?
tt2381249,"00:53:47,129","00:53:50,049",The Chancellor of Austria was assassinated.
tt2381249,"00:53:50,074","00:53:52,960",We believe that Ethan and Benji were there.
tt2381249,"00:53:52,985","00:53:56,604",Huntley's handed this over to Special Activities Division.
tt2381249,"00:53:57,008","00:54:00,142",We need to find Ethan before they do.
tt2381249,"00:54:00,609","00:54:02,911",That's where you come in.
tt2381249,"00:54:04,367","00:54:07,361","- Not interested. - Okay. Look, Luther."
tt2381249,"00:54:07,386","00:54:11,637","Look, man. I know Ethan. I don't know you."
tt2381249,"00:54:11,951","00:54:14,937",All I know about you is that you chose to work for Hunley.
tt2381249,"00:54:14,963","00:54:18,591","Yeah, all I know about you is you chose to resign."
tt2381249,"00:54:18,616","00:54:21,337",You don't have to worry about Ethan.
tt2381249,"00:54:21,362","00:54:24,416","- They'll never catch him - No, they're not going to catch him. No."
tt2381249,"00:54:24,441","00:54:26,812","This is the CIA, this is Hunley we're talking about."
tt2381249,"00:54:26,837","00:54:30,320",Thing are out of control And they're going to kill him.
tt2381249,"00:54:30,815","00:54:34,170",They're going to kill Ethan. They're going to kill Benji.
tt2381249,"00:54:34,229","00:54:38,021",We have to get to them first. Are you going to help me?
tt2381249,"00:54:44,461","00:54:47,164",You need to understand something.
tt2381249,"00:54:47,943","00:54:50,484",Ethan is my friend
tt2381249,"00:54:50,819","00:54:54,884",And if I have 1 second of doubt whose side you're on.
tt2381249,"00:54:57,624","00:54:59,743",I believe you
tt2381249,"00:55:00,688","00:55:02,714",- Alright. - Alright.
tt2381249,"00:55:02,739","00:55:06,163",- What do I have to go on? - Not much.
tt2381249,"00:55:06,188","00:55:08,369",And not a lot of time.
tt2381249,"00:55:09,834","00:55:14,598",His name is Solomon Lane. He created the Syndicate.
tt2381249,"00:55:14,623","00:55:16,614",Where does he come from?
tt2381249,"00:55:17,090","00:55:19,876",He's former British intelligence.
tt2381249,"00:55:20,163","00:55:22,680","Well. If British intelligence knows the Syndicate exist,"
tt2381249,"00:55:22,705","00:55:24,889",why don't they just tell the CIA?
tt2381249,"00:55:24,914","00:55:30,157",Because they don't want anyone knowing the Syndicate was created by one of their own.
tt2381249,"00:55:30,476","00:55:33,308",I was sent undercover to earn Lane's trust.
tt2381249,"00:55:33,333","00:55:36,586",And eventually identifying the members of his organization.
tt2381249,"00:55:36,611","00:55:39,120","For the first time in 2 years,"
tt2381249,"00:55:39,145","00:55:41,607",I'm close to knowing who they are.
tt2381249,"00:55:41,632","00:55:46,176","Lane had a ledger. It contain the identities of his operatives,"
tt2381249,"00:55:46,201","00:55:50,161","his terrorist associates, the entire inner workings of the Syndicate."
tt2381249,"00:55:50,186","00:55:53,368",One of his agents stole it hoping to blackmail him.
tt2381249,"00:55:53,393","00:55:57,500",He kept it in a secure computer facility for safe keeping.
tt2381249,"00:55:57,525","00:56:00,303",He died being interrogated for the access code.
tt2381249,"00:56:00,328","00:56:03,264",Leaving Lane with a serious problem.
tt2381249,"00:56:04,318","00:56:10,951",So the key to crushing Lane is sitting in a computer just waiting for someone to take it?
tt2381249,"00:56:11,197","00:56:14,946",So why hasn't Lane just send someone to steal it?
tt2381249,"00:56:15,048","00:56:19,497","Oh, he has. He sent me."
tt2381249,"00:56:19,626","00:56:21,515",And I can tell you.
tt2381249,"00:56:22,401","00:56:24,526",It's impossible.
tt2381249,"00:56:27,833","00:56:31,469",The facility is hidden beneath the local power plant under military guard.
tt2381249,"00:56:31,494","00:56:36,897",And the only way to download the ledger is through the central computer terminal located there.
tt2381249,"00:56:37,629","00:56:41,164","To reach the terminal, you'll need to pass the main gates."
tt2381249,"00:56:41,653","00:56:45,144",Access the elevator with fingerprint recognition
tt2381249,"00:56:45,664","00:56:49,050",And open 3 separate combination locks.
tt2381249,"00:56:54,090","00:56:57,219","Well, that's easy. We just impersonate the agent who stole the ledger in the first place."
tt2381249,"00:56:57,244","00:57:00,068",And. I get to wear a mask.
tt2381249,"00:57:22,109","00:57:26,288","Unfortunately, even if you can make it through every other security measure"
tt2381249,"00:57:26,313","00:57:30,126",you won't beat the last one. That's because it's protected by gait analysis.
tt2381249,"00:57:30,151","00:57:32,373",A step beyond facial recognition.
tt2381249,"00:57:32,398","00:57:35,166","These cameras actually know how the agent walks,"
tt2381249,"00:57:35,191","00:57:39,618","how he talks, how he moves, right down to his facial takes."
tt2381249,"00:57:46,781","00:57:48,781","So, what you're saying is, no mask can beat it."
tt2381249,"00:57:48,806","00:57:50,250",We're busted before we could even get into the vault.
tt2381249,"00:57:50,275","00:57:54,366",And I wind up in a Morocco jail playing mommies and daddies without a mother strangler.
tt2381249,"00:57:54,391","00:57:56,473","Okay, I don't get to wear a mask."
tt2381249,"00:57:56,498","00:57:59,443",- And there's no other way into the computer lab? - No other way in.
tt2381249,"00:57:59,468","00:58:01,816",- Air Shaft? - 6 inch diameter pipe.
tt2381249,"00:58:01,841","00:58:05,467","- Foundation? - 12 feet of concrete, top and bottom."
tt2381249,"00:58:05,492","00:58:07,169","- Electrical conduit? - Bottom line is,"
tt2381249,"00:58:07,194","00:58:08,861",there's no way into that terminal unless
tt2381249,"00:58:08,886","00:58:13,076",your profile is pre-installed in the security system.
tt2381249,"00:58:13,628","00:58:15,267",Profile?
tt2381249,"00:58:15,843","00:58:17,355",Where're the profile stored?
tt2381249,"00:58:17,380","00:58:21,482",All security data is stored offline in the liquid cooler aid.
tt2381249,"00:58:21,521","00:58:24,584","Here, inside the torus, liquid cooled."
tt2381249,"00:58:24,609","00:58:26,507",You mean that thing is under water?
tt2381249,"00:58:26,532","00:58:28,685",- Yes. - Yes.
tt2381249,"00:58:28,710","00:58:29,790",Okay.
tt2381249,"00:58:29,815","00:58:34,149","So, to get the ledger, one of us needs to enter the  torus"
tt2381249,"00:58:34,425","00:58:37,311",and change the security profile.
tt2381249,"00:58:38,413","00:58:42,404",So that the other one can access the computer without being caught.
tt2381249,"00:58:43,678","00:58:47,694",- That's the only way. - That's the only way.
tt2381249,"00:58:48,583","00:58:49,819",Can I get in through there.
tt2381249,"00:58:49,844","00:58:52,068",- What's that? - That's the service hatch.
tt2381249,"00:58:52,093","00:58:55,580","It can only be opened from the inside If you try and open it from the outside,"
tt2381249,"00:58:55,616","00:58:59,026",you'll be hit with 70 thousand gallons of pressurized water.
tt2381249,"00:58:59,051","00:59:02,344",- Where does the water come from? - Desalinized seawater flows through the intake.
tt2381249,"00:59:02,369","00:59:04,699",in the pipeline. And before you ask.
tt2381249,"00:59:04,724","00:59:10,063",The system is designed to shut down automatically if any metal enters the intake.
tt2381249,"00:59:10,088","00:59:12,615",No oxygen tanks.
tt2381249,"00:59:13,913","00:59:18,360","Alright. Well, how long will it take to free swim from the intake to the service hatch."
tt2381249,"00:59:18,401","00:59:20,782",2 minutes. With the current at full power.
tt2381249,"00:59:20,806","00:59:23,295","Well. Then, you just have to hold your breath for 2 minutes."
tt2381249,"00:59:23,321","00:59:27,191",- What about installing the security profile? - Well. That's gonna be like a minute tops.
tt2381249,"00:59:27,216","00:59:29,189","So, I have to hold my breath for 3 minutes?"
tt2381249,"00:59:29,214","00:59:30,373",You can do that.
tt2381249,"00:59:30,398","00:59:32,624","But I think you're overlooking, is the physical exertion."
tt2381249,"00:59:32,649","00:59:35,760","The more you exert yourself, the faster you consume oxygen."
tt2381249,"00:59:35,785","00:59:37,305",Don't worry about him. Alright.
tt2381249,"00:59:37,306","00:59:40,999",All he has to do is install the fake profile before I get to the gait analysis.
tt2381249,"00:59:41,024","00:59:43,415","You said it yourself, it's the only way"
tt2381249,"00:59:43,440","00:59:46,046",That doesn't sound impossible.
tt2381249,"00:59:49,125","00:59:51,891","Satellite over-watch covering all 7 continents,"
tt2381249,"00:59:51,916","00:59:56,135","DNA profiling, facial recognition, drone surveillance, drone strikes."
tt2381249,"00:59:56,160","00:59:58,977","So, how are we suppose to find Ethan and Benji before they do?"
tt2381249,"00:59:59,002","01:00:02,791",I'm not even looking for them. I'm looking for her.
tt2381249,"01:00:02,886","01:00:04,663",What do you mean?
tt2381249,"01:00:05,165","01:00:08,789","These sketches, what do you see?"
tt2381249,"01:00:09,968","01:00:13,549",Ethan's not exactly sure who this guys is.
tt2381249,"01:00:14,610","01:00:18,177","But this woman, he knows her."
tt2381249,"01:00:18,202","01:00:20,030",He trust her.
tt2381249,"01:00:20,055","01:00:22,709","I'm betting that if he's not already with her, he's on his way."
tt2381249,"01:00:22,710","01:00:24,232","Find her, find Ethan."
tt2381249,"01:00:24,257","01:00:26,702",Tell me it's possible to pull facial recognition of a sketch.
tt2381249,"01:00:26,727","01:00:30,811","For mere mortals, no. For me, I could've done this at home."
tt2381249,"01:00:30,836","01:00:32,593",Alright.
tt2381249,"01:00:36,539","01:00:39,255",- How long is this going to take? - Found her.
tt2381249,"01:00:41,654","01:00:46,075",CCTV picked her up at the airport in Casablanca.

tt2381249,"01:00:49,676","01:00:52,137",She's bad news.
tt2381249,"01:01:12,663","01:01:16,035",- Card. - Hello.

tt2381249,"01:01:51,947","01:01:55,368","- Your card is not working. - Benji, we're in."

tt2381249,"01:02:38,419","01:02:41,589",One more time. You have 3 minutes.
tt2381249,"01:02:41,614","01:02:44,746",2.5 minutes to switch the security profile.
tt2381249,"01:02:44,771","01:02:47,883",30 seconds to escape through the service hatch.
tt2381249,"01:02:47,908","01:02:52,748","Remember, conserve oxygen. Don't move a muscle if you don't have to."
tt2381249,"01:03:10,044","01:03:12,276",I'm in the elevator.
tt2381249,"01:03:22,821","01:03:25,589",That current will carry you to a torus.
tt2381249,"01:03:25,614","01:03:28,068","Once you're there, I'll shut it down."
tt2381249,"01:03:28,093","01:03:31,906",Important note. The profile is in slot 108.
tt2381249,"01:03:31,930","01:03:33,965","And a slightly more important note,"
tt2381249,"01:03:33,991","01:03:36,915","if you haven't switched that profile before I reach the gait analysis,"
tt2381249,"01:03:36,940","01:03:38,282",I'm dead.
tt2381249,"01:03:38,307","01:03:40,374","Thank you, Benji."
tt2381249,"01:04:49,155","01:04:52,767",- What's the problem? - The cooling system is rebooting...

tt2381249,"01:12:58,072","01:13:00,354",I mean. A minute ago you were dead.
tt2381249,"01:13:00,379","01:13:02,546",What are you talking about?
tt2381249,"01:13:02,571","01:13:05,032",This is not gonna end well.
tt2381249,"01:13:14,905","01:13:16,742",There she is.
tt2381249,"01:13:26,837","01:13:29,341","Stairs, stairs, stairs!"
tt2381249,"01:13:29,520","01:13:31,847","Stairs, stairs, stairs!"
tt2381249,"01:13:32,999","01:13:35,732",Ah! God damn it.
tt2381249,"01:14:05,770","01:14:07,465",Whoa.
tt2381249,"01:14:15,926","01:14:17,375",Hey?
tt2381249,"01:14:19,189","01:14:20,881",I found them.
tt2381249,"01:14:21,805","01:14:24,002","Come on, man."
tt2381249,"01:14:26,175","01:14:28,207",Shit.
tt2381249,"01:14:28,610","01:14:30,250",It's a high-speed chase.
tt2381249,"01:14:30,275","01:14:32,557","You just had to get the 4 by 4, didn't you?"
tt2381249,"01:14:32,582","01:14:34,266","Hey, look. Don't blame me. You chose the car."
tt2381249,"01:14:34,291","01:14:36,176",- You just had to have it! - Do you want me to drive?
tt2381249,"01:14:36,201","01:14:37,566","- Do you want me to drive? - Look, it's a stick."
tt2381249,"01:14:37,591","01:14:40,617",Look at this. Look how slow you're going. Speed it up.
tt2381249,"01:14:44,959","01:14:46,959",Who's this guy?
tt2381249,"01:14:48,430","01:14:50,430",Shit!
tt2381249,"01:15:08,816","01:15:11,072",AWW!
tt2381249,"01:15:16,467","01:15:18,931",Go-go-go- Go!
tt2381249,"01:15:21,386","01:15:24,190",I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.
tt2381249,"01:15:28,474","01:15:29,833",Ho!
tt2381249,"01:15:30,458","01:15:32,840",Whoa-whoa-whoa...
tt2381249,"01:15:40,047","01:15:42,047",Here they come!
tt2381249,"01:15:42,072","01:15:44,075",What're we gonna do?
tt2381249,"01:15:56,596","01:15:58,433",Gun!
tt2381249,"01:16:01,047","01:16:02,598",Do you have your seat belts on?
tt2381249,"01:16:02,623","01:16:04,790",What? You're asking me that now?
tt2381249,"01:16:12,342","01:16:14,534",- Hang on! - Ah!
tt2381249,"01:16:15,097","01:16:16,695",Aww!
tt2381249,"01:16:53,337","01:16:55,122",Are you good?
tt2381249,"01:16:55,147","01:16:57,546",Things... got a little out of hand.
tt2381249,"01:16:57,571","01:16:59,971",Aw! Look out!
tt2381249,"01:17:04,303","01:17:07,274",Okay. We're good?
tt2381249,"01:17:15,492","01:17:17,890","Oh, hi boys. What did I miss?"
tt2381249,"01:17:22,801","01:17:25,791","Woo. That look sharp. Careful, careful."
tt2381249,"01:21:07,568","01:21:09,921","So, what do we do now?"
tt2381249,"01:21:11,846","01:21:15,638","Please tell me, you made a copy of that disk.."
tt2381249,"01:21:17,332","01:21:19,972",Of course I made a copy.
tt2381249,"01:21:27,354","01:21:29,354",So where are we going?
tt2381249,"01:21:53,287","01:21:54,491",It's a ledger.
tt2381249,"01:21:54,516","01:21:56,707",The Syndicate's entire infrastructure.
tt2381249,"01:21:56,732","01:22:00,040","Who they are, the politicians they control, and where the money comes from."
tt2381249,"01:22:00,549","01:22:02,704",It's everything you want to know.
tt2381249,"01:22:02,737","01:22:06,874",What makes you think this so-called ledger is authentic?
tt2381249,"01:22:06,899","01:22:09,514",Why would Lane want it so badly if it wasn't authentic?
tt2381249,"01:22:09,539","01:22:12,066",Why would he ever let you have it if it was?
tt2381249,"01:22:12,091","01:22:15,391",Did you never stop to consider he may want me to have it?
tt2381249,"01:22:15,416","01:22:16,958","Misinformation, manipulation."
tt2381249,"01:22:16,983","01:22:19,605","What he does exercise, what he's trained to do."
tt2381249,"01:22:19,630","01:22:22,909","Lane lies to you, you sell his lies to Hunt."
tt2381249,"01:22:22,934","01:22:24,603","Together, you both are compromised."
tt2381249,"01:22:24,628","01:22:27,012",That's his ultimate objective.
tt2381249,"01:22:27,037","01:22:28,915",This may be authentic.
tt2381249,"01:22:28,940","01:22:34,194",But there's only one person I trust to verify that information. You.
tt2381249,"01:22:35,668","01:22:37,136",No.
tt2381249,"01:22:38,443","01:22:41,207",My orders were to deliver you information regarding the Syndicate.
tt2381249,"01:22:41,232","01:22:46,487",Your orders were to infiltrate the Syndicate that we may learn more about them first hand.
tt2381249,"01:22:46,512","01:22:48,781","This isn't prove, it's a test, like everything else."
tt2381249,"01:22:48,806","01:22:51,336","The only way to pass, is to go back."
tt2381249,"01:22:51,361","01:22:52,815",I can't do that.
tt2381249,"01:22:52,840","01:22:55,546",I betrayed Lane's trust too many times.
tt2381249,"01:22:55,571","01:22:57,880","And in every instance, you did so on you own volition."
tt2381249,"01:22:57,905","01:23:00,641",He was going to tortured and killed an American agent.
tt2381249,"01:23:00,666","01:23:04,155","And you should've let him, and you would still have Lane's trust."
tt2381249,"01:23:04,180","01:23:06,281","This is the trade, Hunt understands that."
tt2381249,"01:23:06,306","01:23:08,846",I wasn't going to let him die. He is our ally.
tt2381249,"01:23:08,871","01:23:13,424","There are no allies in state craft, Ilsa. Only common interest."
tt2381249,"01:23:13,449","01:23:17,143","As it stands, Ethan Hunt is a man without a country."
tt2381249,"01:23:17,168","01:23:21,876",This makes killing him decidedly less complicated.
tt2381249,"01:23:23,038","01:23:24,896",Are you ordering me to kill Hunt?
tt2381249,"01:23:24,921","01:23:27,928","Good god, no. Nothing so crude as that, no."
tt2381249,"01:23:28,638","01:23:30,811",Lane will order you.
tt2381249,"01:23:30,836","01:23:36,010","And to regain his trust, you will do it."
tt2381249,"01:23:36,496","01:23:39,677",You sent me to do a job.
tt2381249,"01:23:39,702","01:23:41,595",I did it.
tt2381249,"01:23:41,751","01:23:43,783","Now, you bring me in."
tt2381249,"01:23:43,807","01:23:48,017","Might I remind you, you're without a country of your own."
tt2381249,"01:23:48,320","01:23:51,309",The director of the CIA called me inquiring about you personally.
tt2381249,"01:23:51,334","01:23:53,887","Of course to protect your cover, I had to lie."
tt2381249,"01:23:53,912","01:23:55,390","So, as far as the Americans are concern,"
tt2381249,"01:23:55,415","01:23:59,264","you're a rogue assassin, a target of opportunity."
tt2381249,"01:23:59,440","01:24:02,740",A precious few people know about your true identity.
tt2381249,"01:24:02,765","01:24:08,111",It would be unfortunate if we forgot.
tt2381249,"01:24:08,445","01:24:11,470","You see, there really is no choice ,Ilsa."
tt2381249,"01:24:11,495","01:24:13,789",You're going back.
tt2381249,"01:24:20,844","01:24:24,258",Glad to know you're still with us.
tt2381249,"01:24:32,073","01:24:33,353",What? What's happening?
tt2381249,"01:24:33,354","01:24:34,811",I can't open it.
tt2381249,"01:24:34,812","01:24:36,029",What do you mean you can't open it?
tt2381249,"01:24:36,054","01:24:38,299","I mean I can't open it, ever."
tt2381249,"01:24:38,324","01:24:40,112",That's a red box.
tt2381249,"01:24:40,137","01:24:42,003",- A what? - It's a red box.
tt2381249,"01:24:42,028","01:24:44,950",The British government uses it to transport national secrets.
tt2381249,"01:24:44,975","01:24:46,024",Doesn't sound good.
tt2381249,"01:24:46,049","01:24:48,545",Meaning it's triple encrypted. You don't get into that thing
tt2381249,"01:24:48,570","01:24:54,024","unless you have fingerprints, retinal scan, and a voice phrase spoken by a specific individual."
tt2381249,"01:24:54,049","01:24:56,454",The Prime Minister of Great Britain himself.
tt2381249,"01:24:56,479","01:24:57,662","Yes, him."
tt2381249,"01:24:57,687","01:24:59,747","So, what you're saying is, there is no ledger."
tt2381249,"01:24:59,748","01:25:02,258",which means we have no proof that the Syndicate even exist.
tt2381249,"01:25:02,283","01:25:03,741","So, we're back to square one."
tt2381249,"01:25:03,766","01:25:06,331","Only now, we're all wanted by the CIA."
tt2381249,"01:25:06,356","01:25:08,273",I'm so proud of us.
tt2381249,"01:25:08,298","01:25:13,801",What I don't understand is why is there a red box sat in a private data vault in Morocco.
tt2381249,"01:25:13,826","01:25:16,155",And why would Lane want it if he can't open it?
tt2381249,"01:25:16,180","01:25:19,506","If Lane wants it, you can bet that he has a plan to open it."
tt2381249,"01:25:20,687","01:25:23,337",And we just help him steal it.
tt2381249,"01:25:26,497","01:25:28,558",He's going to take the Prime Minister.
tt2381249,"01:25:28,573","01:25:30,358","Yes, he is."
tt2381249,"01:25:30,547","01:25:31,738",The question is how?
tt2381249,"01:25:31,763","01:25:33,342","Well, we have to warn the British government."
tt2381249,"01:25:33,367","01:25:35,369","- Yeah, MI6. - No, no, Brandt."
tt2381249,"01:25:35,394","01:25:37,094",Put down the phone. Let's think about this.
tt2381249,"01:25:37,119","01:25:39,595","We have a responsibility to warn the British government,"
tt2381249,"01:25:39,620","01:25:42,105",and not gamble with the Prime Minister's life.
tt2381249,"01:25:42,130","01:25:44,905","Ethan, just so you can beat the guy"
tt2381249,"01:25:44,930","01:25:48,171",that's beaten you at every turn.
tt2381249,"01:25:49,647","01:25:51,887",Is that what you think this is?
tt2381249,"01:25:51,950","01:25:53,528",Brandt?
tt2381249,"01:25:55,793","01:25:58,320",Is that what you think this is?
tt2381249,"01:25:58,745","01:26:00,041","I think right now,"
tt2381249,"01:26:00,066","01:26:02,173",you're incapable of seeing that there's another way.
tt2381249,"01:26:02,198","01:26:05,701",And sometimes Ethan is the only one capable of seeing the only way.
tt2381249,"01:26:05,726","01:26:08,363","And if he's wrong, then we have Vienna"
tt2381249,"01:26:08,388","01:26:09,478",all over again.
tt2381249,"01:26:09,503","01:26:12,235","No, you don't know him. If he wants something to happen,"
tt2381249,"01:26:12,260","01:26:13,637",there's no preventing it.
tt2381249,"01:26:13,662","01:26:15,673",That's why we have to warn the British.
tt2381249,"01:26:15,698","01:26:18,078",Maybe that's exactly what he wants us to do.
tt2381249,"01:26:18,103","01:26:20,310",Are you listening to yourself? We're going to  warn the British.
tt2381249,"01:26:20,335","01:26:22,916","No. We're going to find Lane, we're going to get him."
tt2381249,"01:26:22,941","01:26:25,533",Before he takes the Prime Minister.
tt2381249,"01:26:30,210","01:26:31,617",Okay.
tt2381249,"01:26:31,642","01:26:34,556","Alright, Ethan. We're going to find Lane."
tt2381249,"01:26:34,581","01:26:36,487",But please tell me.
tt2381249,"01:26:36,488","01:26:38,819",How're we going to do that?
tt2381249,"01:27:17,527","01:27:19,194",All is forgiven.
tt2381249,"01:27:19,219","01:27:21,323","That isn't a ledger, is it?"
tt2381249,"01:27:21,348","01:27:23,633",You didn't take a look for yourself?
tt2381249,"01:27:23,658","01:27:25,083",Of course I did.
tt2381249,"01:27:25,084","01:27:26,842",But the file was encrypted.
tt2381249,"01:27:26,843","01:27:28,368",And why would I lie to you?
tt2381249,"01:27:28,393","01:27:30,689",So that I would lie to Hunt.
tt2381249,"01:27:31,949","01:27:35,431",But he wouldn't have stolen it if he knew what it was.
tt2381249,"01:27:36,077","01:27:38,369",And she wouldn't have helped him.
tt2381249,"01:27:39,747","01:27:41,827",What is actually on that disk?
tt2381249,"01:27:41,852","01:27:45,569",I'll be honest with you when you start being honest with me.
tt2381249,"01:27:46,322","01:27:48,971","And you and I, we both know why you come back."
tt2381249,"01:27:48,996","01:27:50,843",Don't we?
tt2381249,"01:27:52,974","01:27:56,006",You're still alive because I believe in your potential.
tt2381249,"01:27:56,031","01:27:58,538",But I'm growing impatient.
tt2381249,"01:27:59,343","01:28:02,483",Why do you continue to resist?
tt2381249,"01:28:05,843","01:28:07,871","Well, if we're being honest,"
tt2381249,"01:28:08,504","01:28:09,957",You're a terrorist.
tt2381249,"01:28:09,982","01:28:13,840","If that were true then my goal would be to spread fear, but my..."
tt2381249,"01:28:13,865","01:28:17,866",method is... far more surgical.
tt2381249,"01:28:19,038","01:28:21,014",You kill innocent people.
tt2381249,"01:28:21,039","01:28:26,067","I helped my government killed many innocent people and more, so much more."
tt2381249,"01:28:26,676","01:28:29,669",Killing to keep things as they were.
tt2381249,"01:28:29,694","01:28:33,559",And now I'm killing to bring about change.
tt2381249,"01:28:33,771","01:28:36,460",I think Ethan Hunt would disagree.
tt2381249,"01:28:36,485","01:28:38,668",Ethan Hunt is a gambler.
tt2381249,"01:28:38,693","01:28:40,935","And one day his luck will run out,"
tt2381249,"01:28:40,960","01:28:44,653",And thousands of innocent people will pay the price.
tt2381249,"01:28:44,678","01:28:47,788",Which one of us will be the villain then?
tt2381249,"01:28:50,736","01:28:53,686",Nothing here. It's empty.
tt2381249,"01:29:09,656","01:29:11,083",I'm interested
tt2381249,"01:29:11,108","01:29:13,667",to see who you blame
tt2381249,"01:29:14,646","01:29:17,244",for what happens next.
tt2381249,"01:30:03,915","01:30:05,387","So, that's her?"
tt2381249,"01:30:05,388","01:30:07,494",That's her.
tt2381249,"01:30:10,211","01:30:12,211",I have to say
tt2381249,"01:30:13,126","01:30:15,324",you sure can ride.
tt2381249,"01:30:17,566","01:30:20,297",- Ethan. - You're just doing your job.
tt2381249,"01:30:21,184","01:30:23,662",That's all I'm going to say about it.
tt2381249,"01:30:24,910","01:30:26,721",Atlee said you'd understand.
tt2381249,"01:30:26,746","01:30:30,525","Atlee, your handler in British Intelligence."
tt2381249,"01:30:33,283","01:30:35,607",And he didn't bring you in?
tt2381249,"01:30:37,041","01:30:39,663",Even after you gave him the disk?
tt2381249,"01:30:39,688","01:30:42,799",You knew perfectly well it was blank.
tt2381249,"01:30:42,824","01:30:46,550",That's a lie. The disk she took from me was an exact copy. I'm of it.
tt2381249,"01:30:46,575","01:30:49,660",Was it in your possession the entire time?
tt2381249,"01:30:54,418","01:30:55,522","<font color=""#e4adc0"">DELETING FILES</font>"
tt2381249,"01:30:55,547","01:30:56,810","<font color=""#e4adc0"">FILES DELETED</font>"
tt2381249,"01:30:59,620","01:31:01,234",Oh.
tt2381249,"01:31:01,287","01:31:04,607",They don't care if you live or die.
tt2381249,"01:31:11,314","01:31:14,394",But you knew I was going to take it to him.
tt2381249,"01:31:14,419","01:31:15,953",I hope you would.
tt2381249,"01:31:15,978","01:31:18,687",I hope it would be enough to get you out.
tt2381249,"01:31:18,972","01:31:22,049","Whoa-whoa-whoa. That means Lane doesn't have the disk, only we do."
tt2381249,"01:31:22,074","01:31:25,154","I have a question. If the disk was blank,"
tt2381249,"01:31:25,179","01:31:27,337",why is she still alive?
tt2381249,"01:31:27,362","01:31:29,251","Unless, of course,"
tt2381249,"01:31:29,252","01:31:31,659",Lane wanted us to find her.
tt2381249,"01:31:32,840","01:31:35,334","So, who're you working for now?"
tt2381249,"01:31:35,628","01:31:39,701","Lane, Atlee, your government, my government, they're all the same"
tt2381249,"01:31:39,974","01:31:44,442",We only think we're fighting for the right side because that's what we choose to believe.
tt2381249,"01:31:45,356","01:31:47,341",So what does that leave us?
tt2381249,"01:31:47,342","01:31:50,123","The way I see it, you have 3 choices."
tt2381249,"01:31:50,152","01:31:53,878","One, you hand me and the disk over to the CIA."
tt2381249,"01:31:53,903","01:31:55,718",I'm proof that Syndicate exist.
tt2381249,"01:31:55,743","01:31:59,244","Lane becomes their problem, and... your work is done."
tt2381249,"01:31:59,269","01:32:01,779",- My thoughts exactly. - Works for me.
tt2381249,"01:32:01,804","01:32:03,876",But you know they're not going to believe you.
tt2381249,"01:32:03,901","01:32:06,713",And you all will be trialed for treason.
tt2381249,"01:32:06,738","01:32:08,215",Lane goes free.
tt2381249,"01:32:08,240","01:32:10,148",I'm afraid she's has a point.
tt2381249,"01:32:10,149","01:32:14,226","Two, you let me walk away to an uncertain fate."
tt2381249,"01:32:14,251","01:32:17,915",You use the disk as bait to trap Lane.
tt2381249,"01:32:18,209","01:32:20,992",But some part of you suspect you've met your match.
tt2381249,"01:32:21,017","01:32:23,711","And being a gambler, you'll probably end up handing Lane that disk"
tt2381249,"01:32:23,736","01:32:26,020",whether you want to or not.
tt2381249,"01:32:26,045","01:32:28,292",That is entirely possible.
tt2381249,"01:32:28,317","01:32:30,317",And option three?
tt2381249,"01:32:30,382","01:32:32,643",Come away with me.
tt2381249,"01:32:33,570","01:32:35,654",Right now.
tt2381249,"01:32:38,051","01:32:40,548",Oh boy.
tt2381249,"01:32:43,525","01:32:45,298",And what about Lane?
tt2381249,"01:32:45,299","01:32:47,449",Forget about Lane.
tt2381249,"01:32:47,474","01:32:49,937",There will always be another Lane.
tt2381249,"01:32:49,962","01:32:53,307",There will always be people like us to face him.
tt2381249,"01:32:53,682","01:32:57,195",We've done our part and we've been cast aside.
tt2381249,"01:32:57,708","01:33:00,316",We can be anyone.
tt2381249,"01:33:00,341","01:33:02,911",We can do anything.
tt2381249,"01:33:04,262","01:33:06,755",It's only a matter of going.
tt2381249,"01:33:19,629","01:33:22,923","Lane sent you to deliver a message, didn't he?"
tt2381249,"01:33:23,254","01:33:26,201",I saved you life twice. I won't be able to do it again.
tt2381249,"01:33:26,226","01:33:28,379",What's the message?
tt2381249,"01:33:40,819","01:33:42,545",Benji.
tt2381249,"01:33:54,587","01:33:56,062",Parking garage
tt2381249,"01:33:56,087","01:33:58,279","Luther, stay with her."
tt2381249,"01:34:21,890","01:34:23,127",She's gone.
tt2381249,"01:34:23,152","01:34:25,152",I lost her.
tt2381249,"01:34:27,672","01:34:30,051","She set us up, Ethan."
tt2381249,"01:34:30,076","01:34:31,938","No, she delivered a message."
tt2381249,"01:34:31,963","01:34:33,565",She set us up!
tt2381249,"01:34:33,590","01:34:34,841",She knew this would happen.
tt2381249,"01:34:34,866","01:34:38,722",Only Lane knows what's going to happen.
tt2381249,"01:34:43,702","01:34:45,536","I have a job for you, Ethan."
tt2381249,"01:34:45,561","01:34:48,318","And for the sake of your friend, you will do it."
tt2381249,"01:34:48,343","01:34:49,477",I'm listening.
tt2381249,"01:34:49,502","01:34:52,426","Your mission, should you choose to accept it,"
tt2381249,"01:34:52,451","01:34:56,058",Is to bring me the unlocked disk by midnight today.
tt2381249,"01:34:56,083","01:34:58,704","Now say the words, please."
tt2381249,"01:34:59,086","01:35:01,086",I accept.
tt2381249,"01:35:01,480","01:35:03,257",Yes.
tt2381249,"01:35:05,739","01:35:07,739",I knew you would.
tt2381249,"01:35:14,377","01:35:19,429","He wants the disk, unlocked, by midnight tonight"
tt2381249,"01:35:19,454","01:35:24,971","Ethan, there's only one person on earth who can unlock that disk."
tt2381249,"01:35:25,231","01:35:28,017",We have to take the Prime Minister.
tt2381249,"01:35:28,507","01:35:31,437",Let's just think about that for a minute.
tt2381249,"01:35:32,487","01:35:34,756",That's the only way to get Benji back.
tt2381249,"01:35:34,781","01:35:38,299","Ethan, that's exactly what Lane wants you to do."
tt2381249,"01:35:38,324","01:35:41,967",Which is why it has to happen.
tt2381249,"01:35:45,844","01:35:48,351",This is how we beat Lane.
tt2381249,"01:35:48,615","01:35:50,898",This is how we make everything right.
tt2381249,"01:35:50,923","01:35:55,190",Can you see? Can you see it?
tt2381249,"01:36:08,478","01:36:12,888","William Brandt, sir. He says it's urgent."
tt2381249,"01:36:16,885","01:36:18,961","I had a feeling you'd come to your senses, Brandt."
tt2381249,"01:36:18,992","01:36:21,494",I'm only calling you because I've no other choice.
tt2381249,"01:36:21,519","01:36:23,377",I'm trying to prevent a catastrophe.
tt2381249,"01:36:23,402","01:36:26,336",I can understand that. Where are you?
tt2381249,"01:36:27,461","01:36:30,947","- London - Reroute us to London, now."
tt2381249,"01:36:30,972","01:36:33,712","- Where in London? - I'll tell you when you land, not before."
tt2381249,"01:36:33,737","01:36:35,701","I'm not interested in playing games, Brandt."
tt2381249,"01:36:35,726","01:36:38,830",And I'm not interested in seeing my friends get killed either.
tt2381249,"01:36:38,855","01:36:41,376","So if I'm going to betray them, we're going to do this in my terms"
tt2381249,"01:36:41,401","01:36:43,344",and my terms only. Do you understand?
tt2381249,"01:36:43,369","01:36:46,338","Keep your phone on, instruction will follow."
tt2381249,"01:36:51,860","01:36:55,600",- Should have been gone by now. - Yeah.
tt2381249,"01:36:57,987","01:37:00,654",- You okay? - Yeah.
tt2381249,"01:37:02,711","01:37:07,019",We're suppose to take down the Prime Minister of Great Britain tonight.
tt2381249,"01:37:07,373","01:37:09,195",So...
tt2381249,"01:37:10,277","01:37:11,984",Brandt.
tt2381249,"01:37:14,737","01:37:17,762",I cant' see another way.
tt2381249,"01:37:19,659","01:37:21,808",Neither can I.
tt2381249,"01:37:23,766","01:37:27,081","What we do, we have to do for our friends, right?"
tt2381249,"01:38:11,584","01:38:13,856","Get him ready, please."
tt2381249,"01:38:38,428","01:38:40,467","You're right to call me, Brandt. Where is Hunt?"
tt2381249,"01:38:40,492","01:38:42,440",He's on his way. We don't have much time.
tt2381249,"01:38:42,465","01:38:45,212",- What does he intend to do? - What matter is he's alive.
tt2381249,"01:38:45,237","01:38:49,558",And I need your reassurance that it's going to stay that way.
tt2381249,"01:39:04,406","01:39:07,755",Have you informed the British Government that Hunt has targeted the Prime Minister?
tt2381249,"01:39:07,780","01:39:12,967",I will help you capture him... alive. That is the deal.
tt2381249,"01:39:18,540","01:39:21,163","You picked up some terrible habits from your friend, Brandt"
tt2381249,"01:39:21,188","01:39:25,517",The worst of them being that you still believe you can control any outcome.
tt2381249,"01:39:25,542","01:39:27,484",Stay with him.
tt2381249,"01:39:31,056","01:39:33,358",Chief Atlee. Chief Atlee.
tt2381249,"01:39:33,383","01:39:35,741","Director Hunley, how delightful to see you here."
tt2381249,"01:39:35,766","01:39:39,703","Last time we spoke, you were hunting rogue agents in Morocco."
tt2381249,"01:39:39,728","01:39:44,336","Chief Atlee, I have reason to believe that the Prime Minister's life is in danger."
tt2381249,"01:39:46,812","01:39:48,906",I'm listening.
tt2381249,"01:39:51,402","01:39:55,266","Any advance on 22,000? Anyone?"
tt2381249,"01:39:55,291","01:39:57,996",Going once. Going twice.
tt2381249,"01:39:58,021","01:40:00,890",Sold! To our generous Chairwoman.
tt2381249,"01:40:00,925","01:40:03,866",Sir. Chief Atlee from MI6 needs to see you.
tt2381249,"01:40:03,891","01:40:06,180",He says it's urgent.
tt2381249,"01:40:06,785","01:40:08,747",Excuse me.
tt2381249,"01:40:18,828","01:40:23,479","- What's this all about? - It's a matter of national security, Sir."
tt2381249,"01:40:30,012","01:40:34,755",- Under no circumstances is anyone to enter. - Yes sir.
tt2381249,"01:40:35,842","01:40:38,174",Help me to understand.
tt2381249,"01:40:38,199","01:40:40,960",Who is this man? Why is he after me?
tt2381249,"01:40:40,985","01:40:46,075","I'm afraid, Prime Minister, Director Hunley and I share responsibility for this."
tt2381249,"01:40:46,100","01:40:50,535",Ethan Hunt was part of a disgrace intelligence agency which is since been dissolved.
tt2381249,"01:40:50,560","01:40:55,873","And he's gone rogue, unfortunately intend on dismantling  an imaginary terror network."
tt2381249,"01:40:55,898","01:41:00,097",Our new intelligence suggest that he's been manipulated by one of your own former agent.
tt2381249,"01:41:00,122","01:41:03,210","Ilsa Faust, Prime Minister. She disappeared 2 years ago."
tt2381249,"01:41:03,235","01:41:04,903","And if you don't mind I asking,"
tt2381249,"01:41:04,928","01:41:07,229",what do I have to do with this phantom network?
tt2381249,"01:41:07,254","01:41:10,185","Sir, this is William Brandt, a former colleague of Hunt's."
tt2381249,"01:41:10,210","01:41:13,495",He came forward with first hand knowledge of the plot against you.
tt2381249,"01:41:13,520","01:41:18,104",Sir. Hunt is in possession of a virtual red box that can only be open by you.
tt2381249,"01:41:18,129","01:41:22,200",He believes it is the key to bring down the Syndicate.
tt2381249,"01:41:23,320","01:41:28,577","- The Syndicate, you say? - Yes, Sir. That's what he calls it."
tt2381249,"01:41:29,100","01:41:30,824",Atlee.
tt2381249,"01:41:30,849","01:41:36,060","He couldn't possibly be talking about that ""Syndicate""?"
tt2381249,"01:41:37,586","01:41:41,653","'Cause you assured me that, that ""Syndicate"" was merely an exercise?"
tt2381249,"01:41:41,678","01:41:45,064","And it was, Prime Minister. I can assure you."
tt2381249,"01:41:45,089","01:41:48,261","And yet, here we have the Central Intelligence Agency indicating otherwise."
tt2381249,"01:41:48,286","01:41:51,912","- I don't understand. - Prime Minister, your life is in danger."
tt2381249,"01:41:51,937","01:41:55,350",I think our first priority is to move you to a secure location. - Sir.
tt2381249,"01:41:55,375","01:41:59,673","Does the name Solomon Lane, ring a bell?"
tt2381249,"01:42:00,499","01:42:07,119","Yes. Unfortunately, it does."
tt2381249,"01:42:08,404","01:42:11,366","So, there actually is a Syndicate?"
tt2381249,"01:42:11,391","01:42:15,545",It was a hypothetical brainchild of Chief Atlee.
tt2381249,"01:42:15,579","01:42:19,891",Recruit former agents from other nations. supply them with a new identity
tt2381249,"01:42:19,916","01:42:24,442","and use them to surgically remove our enemies, both at home and abroad."
tt2381249,"01:42:24,467","01:42:30,375",It's operating budget was to be hidden offshore in a virtual red box which I alone would control
tt2381249,"01:42:30,400","01:42:34,447","It would've made me judge, jury and executioner with zero accountability."
tt2381249,"01:42:34,472","01:42:37,113",I rejected the proposal unequivocally.
tt2381249,"01:42:37,138","01:42:41,732","Furthermore, I was given every assurance it never pass the planning stage."
tt2381249,"01:42:41,756","01:42:44,619","Prime Minister, there is no any Syndicate."
tt2381249,"01:42:44,644","01:42:47,139",These people have been duped by agent Faust.
tt2381249,"01:42:47,164","01:42:50,731",Atlee. Save it for the public inquiry.
tt2381249,"01:42:50,758","01:42:52,231","Sir, I urge you not to leave this room."
tt2381249,"01:42:52,256","01:42:54,123",- Excuse me. - Please.
tt2381249,"01:42:54,148","01:42:56,622",Hunt is uniquely trained and highly motivated.
tt2381249,"01:42:56,647","01:42:59,892","A specialist without equal, immune to any counter measures."
tt2381249,"01:42:59,917","01:43:04,078",There is no secret he cannot extract. No security he cannot breach.
tt2381249,"01:43:04,103","01:43:06,638",No person he cannot become.
tt2381249,"01:43:06,663","01:43:09,979",He has mostly likely anticipated this very conversation
tt2381249,"01:43:10,004","01:43:13,176",and is waiting to strike in whatever direction we move.
tt2381249,"01:43:13,201","01:43:17,247",Sir. Hunt is the living manifestation of destiny.
tt2381249,"01:43:17,272","01:43:21,305",And he has made you his mission.
tt2381249,"01:43:21,582","01:43:23,578",Prime Minister.
tt2381249,"01:43:39,361","01:43:40,827",Hunt.
tt2381249,"01:43:40,852","01:43:44,042","Sir, please step away from the Prime Minister."
tt2381249,"01:43:47,117","01:43:49,359","Just relax, Sir. Everything is going to be alright."
tt2381249,"01:43:49,384","01:43:53,098","- Atlee shot me - Yes, he did, Sir."
tt2381249,"01:43:55,793","01:44:01,398","Hunt, I hope you realize you set back US, UK relations to the American revolution."
tt2381249,"01:44:01,423","01:44:05,314","Desperate times, desperate measures, sir."
tt2381249,"01:44:07,211","01:44:09,037",- I'm here. - Standby to receive.
tt2381249,"01:44:09,062","01:44:10,689",Ready.
tt2381249,"01:44:16,297","01:44:18,886",The Prime Minister's office ask me to meet him here.
tt2381249,"01:44:18,911","01:44:20,466","This way, sir"
tt2381249,"01:44:20,491","01:44:22,262",Scanning.
tt2381249,"01:44:25,449","01:44:27,897","Retinal scan, confirm."
tt2381249,"01:44:30,483","01:44:32,909","Some convenience, Sir."
tt2381249,"01:44:33,501","01:44:36,585",You got a very warm hand.
tt2381249,"01:44:45,099","01:44:47,536","Biometric, confirm."
tt2381249,"01:44:47,561","01:44:51,427","- The prompt is ""KIPLING"". - The prompt is ""KIPLING""."
tt2381249,"01:44:51,599","01:44:55,705","Sir, I'm gonna need a pass phrase, the prompt is ""KIPLING""."
tt2381249,"01:44:55,730","01:44:57,383","Yes, of course."
tt2381249,"01:44:57,408","01:45:02,243",""" If you can keep your head when all about you. Are losing theirs..."""
tt2381249,"01:45:06,002","01:45:10,373","""If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you"""
tt2381249,"01:45:14,088","01:45:15,991",- You got it? - I got it.
tt2381249,"01:45:16,016","01:45:17,588","Oh man, do I got it."
tt2381249,"01:45:17,613","01:45:21,807",- I'm here to see the Prime Minister. - We were told not to let anybody in.
tt2381249,"01:45:21,832","01:45:25,204","- By whom? - By you, sir."
tt2381249,"01:45:28,319","01:45:32,552","Hunley, what is this? Security!"
tt2381249,"01:45:38,711","01:45:42,737",Chief Atlee. Kind of you to accepted our invitation.
tt2381249,"01:45:42,766","01:45:44,070",Ah.
tt2381249,"01:45:51,674","01:45:54,686",Do you know who I am?
tt2381249,"01:45:56,017","01:45:58,115",We know you created the Syndicate.
tt2381249,"01:45:58,140","01:46:00,971","But Lane went rogue and turn it against you, didn't he?"
tt2381249,"01:46:00,996","01:46:03,459",And you've been desperately trying to cover it up.
tt2381249,"01:46:03,484","01:46:06,326",That's why you erased the disk which she brought it to you.
tt2381249,"01:46:06,351","01:46:09,014",That's true.
tt2381249,"01:46:10,668","01:46:15,348","Now, Director Hunley has some questions for you regarding Ilsa Faust."
tt2381249,"01:46:15,373","01:46:17,841","Namely, how you frame her."
tt2381249,"01:46:17,866","01:46:21,871",That's also true.
tt2381249,"01:46:25,106","01:46:26,556",It's the antidote.
tt2381249,"01:46:26,581","01:46:29,240",When the Prime Minister found out about the Syndicate.
tt2381249,"01:46:29,265","01:46:32,214","- Atlee had attacked him. - Yes, that's true."
tt2381249,"01:46:32,239","01:46:36,707","- And then you saved the Prime Minister, sir. - Did he?"
tt2381249,"01:46:36,847","01:46:39,310",I'm very grateful.
tt2381249,"01:46:49,485","01:46:50,938",Sir.
tt2381249,"01:46:53,226","01:46:56,816","You're cutting it very close, Ethan"
tt2381249,"01:46:57,396","01:47:00,839",I have what you want. Where do I go?
tt2381249,"01:47:17,261","01:47:19,264","Ethan, wait"
tt2381249,"01:47:19,289","01:47:21,529","If I'm not there in 15 minutes, he'll kill Benji."
tt2381249,"01:47:21,554","01:47:23,400",Your mission is to bring down the Syndicate.
tt2381249,"01:47:23,425","01:47:27,695","If Lane gets his hands on that money, we're unleashing a terrorist superpower."
tt2381249,"01:47:27,720","01:47:30,566",He'll never take me alive. I'll make sure of it.
tt2381249,"01:47:30,591","01:47:34,048","What happens, Ethan, if you can't make it back?"
tt2381249,"01:47:34,194","01:47:36,473",I'll make it back.
tt2381249,"01:47:37,228","01:47:39,140",Just be ready.
tt2381249,"01:47:43,473","01:47:46,456","Greetings, Prime Minister. If you are viewing this message,"
tt2381249,"01:47:46,481","01:47:49,368",it means that you have chosen to activate the Syndicate.
tt2381249,"01:47:49,392","01:47:54,755",This drive gives you access to 2.4 billion pound sterling in untraceable currency.
tt2381249,"01:47:54,780","01:47:59,631",That will allow the Syndicate to operate undetected for decades.
tt2381249,"01:47:59,656","01:48:05,102",Instructions to access these funds are as follows.
tt2381249,"01:49:10,689","01:49:13,631","This is the end, Mr. Hunt."
tt2381249,"01:49:22,318","01:49:23,983",Carefully.
tt2381249,"01:49:26,695","01:49:32,516","2 pounds Semtex, 500, 30 caliber ball bearings."
tt2381249,"01:49:32,541","01:49:36,265",Your friend is sitting on a highly sensitive - pressure trigger.
tt2381249,"01:49:36,290","01:49:39,086","So, no sudden moves."
tt2381249,"01:49:46,649","01:49:47,970",Your final test.
tt2381249,"01:49:47,995","01:49:52,526","When Lane has what he wants, I kill you and Benji."
tt2381249,"01:49:52,748","01:49:57,076","If not, everyone dies."
tt2381249,"01:49:59,278","01:50:03,521","No time to think, Ethan. Have a seat, please."
tt2381249,"01:50:17,844","01:50:21,611","Human nature, my weapon of choice."
tt2381249,"01:50:21,636","01:50:25,311","From the moment I killed the young lady in the record shop,"
tt2381249,"01:50:25,336","01:50:28,739",I knew you would stop at nothing to catch me.
tt2381249,"01:50:28,852","01:50:31,530",I also knew Ilsa wouldn't have a choice.
tt2381249,"01:50:31,555","01:50:35,283",Whether she broke you that night you met or let you go.
tt2381249,"01:50:35,308","01:50:40,671",Whether you let her run in Morocco. Whether she went to Atlee or not.
tt2381249,"01:50:40,702","01:50:45,497",You were certain we would end up where we are... right now.
tt2381249,"01:50:48,669","01:50:50,567",Then again.
tt2381249,"01:50:51,476","01:50:53,613",So was I.
tt2381249,"01:50:54,037","01:50:55,262","I know you, Lane."
tt2381249,"01:50:55,287","01:50:58,293",Somewhere along the line you had a crisis of faith.
tt2381249,"01:50:58,318","01:51:02,191","Human life didn't matter anymore, or maybe it never really did."
tt2381249,"01:51:02,216","01:51:08,363","Either way, you killed too many innocent people without ever asking who is giving the orders."
tt2381249,"01:51:08,388","01:51:09,760",Or why.
tt2381249,"01:51:09,785","01:51:11,973",You blame the system for what you are.
tt2381249,"01:51:11,998","01:51:14,348",Instead of yourself.
tt2381249,"01:51:14,373","01:51:16,375",You wanted revenge.
tt2381249,"01:51:16,400","01:51:18,359",But Rome wasn't destroyed in a day.
tt2381249,"01:51:18,384","01:51:22,218","You needed help, you needed the money. A lot of it."
tt2381249,"01:51:22,250","01:51:25,464",And you'll stop at nothing to get it.
tt2381249,"01:51:25,489","01:51:29,428",That's how I know I'm going to put you in a box.
tt2381249,"01:51:30,610","01:51:34,958",- Where is the disk? - Where is the disk?
tt2381249,"01:51:34,983","01:51:38,858",You like to play games. I've a game for you.
tt2381249,"01:51:38,990","01:51:43,652",I'll give you 50 million dollars
tt2381249,"01:51:44,272","01:51:46,904",to let Benji go.
tt2381249,"01:52:02,405","01:52:07,381",- Where is the disk? - Where is the disk?
tt2381249,"01:52:07,406","01:52:10,225",You're looking at it. I am the disk.
tt2381249,"01:52:10,250","01:52:13,871",I memorized it all 2.4 billion in number accounts.
tt2381249,"01:52:13,896","01:52:17,476","If that vest goes off, you get nothing. Without this money, you are nothing."
tt2381249,"01:52:17,501","01:52:21,282","Without me, you are nothing."
tt2381249,"01:52:25,434","01:52:29,315","Right now, you're thinking it's bluff. I'd never let my friends die."
tt2381249,"01:52:29,340","01:52:32,619",I couldn't possibly memorize the entire disk.
tt2381249,"01:52:32,644","01:52:35,225",There's only one way to be sure.
tt2381249,"01:52:36,061","01:52:38,206",Let Benji go
tt2381249,"01:52:55,385","01:52:57,295",Take him.
tt2381249,"01:53:00,489","01:53:03,466","They come 1 step closer, shoot me."
tt2381249,"01:53:04,762","01:53:06,432",Stop.
tt2381249,"01:53:09,287","01:53:12,241","You remember I told you, one day you were going to take things too far?"
tt2381249,"01:53:12,266","01:53:14,094","This is me speaking, by the way. It's not him."
tt2381249,"01:53:14,119","01:53:19,056","The only way this ends is you and me, Lane, face to face."
tt2381249,"01:53:19,081","01:53:22,088",Only this time I won't be locked in a glass box.
tt2381249,"01:53:22,113","01:53:23,430",You want your money.
tt2381249,"01:53:23,455","01:53:26,868",The bone doctor gonna beat it out of me.
tt2381249,"01:53:26,893","01:53:30,429",Now let Benji go
tt2381249,"01:53:34,461","01:53:37,506",1... 3... 9
tt2381249,"01:53:57,638","01:53:58,940",Go.
tt2381249,"01:53:58,965","01:54:02,001","- Ethan. - Brandt has you waiting, go."
tt2381249,"01:54:09,934","01:54:13,092",- What do I do? - Kill the woman.
tt2381249,"01:54:14,186","01:54:16,465",I need Hunt alive.
tt2381249,"01:55:03,558","01:55:05,391","- Go! - It's Benji, where am I going?"
tt2381249,"01:55:05,416","01:55:07,136",- They're coming. - We're not ready.
tt2381249,"01:55:07,161","01:55:09,139",Then get ready.
tt2381249,"01:55:34,882","01:55:36,525",Which way?
tt2381249,"01:59:55,955","02:00:00,717","Face to face. Just as you wish, Ethan"
tt2381249,"02:00:22,935","02:00:25,226","It hurts, I know."
tt2381249,"02:00:26,705","02:00:30,232","Gentlemen, this is Solomon Lane."
tt2381249,"02:00:30,652","02:00:32,753",Mr. Lane.
tt2381249,"02:00:33,647","02:00:36,506",Meet the IMF.
tt2381249,"02:01:55,077","02:01:57,175",You're free now.
tt2381249,"02:01:59,418","02:02:01,531",Where will you go?
tt2381249,"02:02:02,360","02:02:04,389",I don't know.
tt2381249,"02:02:06,349","02:02:08,682",I've done my part.
tt2381249,"02:02:08,707","02:02:10,358",Yeah.
tt2381249,"02:02:15,427","02:02:17,695","Ethan, we got to go."
tt2381249,"02:02:26,569","02:02:28,910",You better hurry now.
tt2381249,"02:02:30,503","02:02:32,528",Good luck.
tt2381249,"02:02:46,850","02:02:49,345",You know how to find me.
tt2381249,"02:03:06,385","02:03:08,292",Director Hunley.
tt2381249,"02:03:09,861","02:03:12,944",- Director Hunley . - Ah... Mr. Chairman.
tt2381249,"02:03:12,969","02:03:17,864","6 months ago, you stood before this panel and demanded that the IMF be dissolved."
tt2381249,"02:03:17,889","02:03:19,529","That is correct, sir."
tt2381249,"02:03:19,554","02:03:21,573",And how do you explain your testimony today?
tt2381249,"02:03:21,598","02:03:23,829",It's quite simple really. We had reason to believe
tt2381249,"02:03:23,854","02:03:27,382",that the Syndicate have infiltrated our government at the highest level.
tt2381249,"02:03:27,407","02:03:32,835","In order for our Mn to infiltrate that organization, his cover had to be absolute."
tt2381249,"02:03:32,860","02:03:37,269",The whole operation was known only to myself and a handful of IMF agents.
tt2381249,"02:03:37,294","02:03:42,435","So, the shuttering of the IMF was all part of an elaborate scheme."
tt2381249,"02:03:42,460","02:03:45,812","- To expose this so call Syndicate? - That is correct, sir."
tt2381249,"02:03:45,837","02:03:51,308","Which is why you're here today, asking for the IMF to be reinstated."
tt2381249,"02:03:51,333","02:03:53,616","That is correct, sir."
tt2381249,"02:03:55,498","02:03:59,067","I'm not sure the Committee approves of your methods, Director Hunley."
tt2381249,"02:03:59,092","02:04:03,659","Desperate times, desperate measures, Mr. Chairman."
tt2381249,"02:04:04,298","02:04:06,134","And you, Mr. Brandt."
tt2381249,"02:04:06,159","02:04:09,608",How can you justify this deception?
tt2381249,"02:04:10,471","02:04:13,866",I can neither confirm nor deny details of any operation
tt2381249,"02:04:13,891","02:04:16,568",without the Secretary's approval.
tt2381249,"02:04:23,960","02:04:26,142",Welcome to the IMF.
tt2381249,"02:04:26,409","02:04:28,729",Mr. Secretary
