1
00:01:33,452 --> 00:01:38,459
He was delirious. But asked for you
by name.

2
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,058
Show him.

3
00:01:43,357 --> 00:01:46,059
He was carrying nothing but this....

4
00:01:47,462 --> 00:01:49,062
... and this.

5
00:02:10,104 --> 00:02:12,834
Are you here to kill me?

6
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:23,005
I know what this is.

7
00:02:24,085 --> 00:02:29,250
I've seen one before.
Many, many years ago.

8
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:35,761
It belonged to a man I met
in a half-remembered dream.

9
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:42,862
A man possessed
of some radical notions.

10
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:49,608
What is the most resilient parasite?

11
00:02:49,877 --> 00:02:53,244
A bacteria? A virus?

12
00:02:53,814 --> 00:02:55,076
An intestinal worm?

13
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,644
Uh...

14
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:58,444
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say-

15
00:02:58,619 --> 00:02:59,813
An idea.

16
00:03:01,122 --> 00:03:03,613
Resilient. Highly contagious.

17
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,784
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain,
it's almost impossible to eradicate.

18
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:12,495
An idea that is fully formed,
fully understood, that sticks.

19
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:13,895
Right in there somewhere.

20
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,626
For someone like you to steal?

21
00:03:15,803 --> 00:03:18,738
Yes. In the dream state,
your conscious defenses are lowered...

22
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:21,340
...and that makes your thoughts
vulnerable to theft.

23
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:22,737
It's called extraction.

24
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,471
Mr. Saito, we can train
your subconscious to defend itself...

25
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:29,138
...from even the most skilled extractor.

26
00:03:29,317 --> 00:03:30,477
How can you do that?

27
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:33,484
Because I am the most skilled extractor.

28
00:03:33,955 --> 00:03:37,356
I know how to search your mind
and find your secrets. I know the tricks.

29
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:40,460
And I can teach them to you,
so that even when you're asleep...

30
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:42,960
...your defense is never down.

31
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:47,766
Look, if you want my help, you're gonna
have to be completely open with me.

32
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:51,302
I need to know my way around
your thoughts better than your wife...

33
00:03:51,472 --> 00:03:53,770
...better than your therapist,
better than anyone.

34
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,870
If this is a dream,
and you have a safe full of secrets...

35
00:03:57,044 --> 00:03:59,376
...I need to know what's in that safe.

36
00:03:59,547 --> 00:04:03,005
In order for this all to work,
you need to completely let me in.

37
00:04:05,886 --> 00:04:10,516
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen,
as I consider your proposal.

38
00:04:12,994 --> 00:04:14,018
He knows.

39
00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:18,531
What's going on up there?

40
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:15,381
Saito knows. He's playing with us.

41
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,122
Doesn't matter. I can get it here.
Trust me.

42
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:19,782
The information is in the safe.

43
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,121
He looked right at it
when I mentioned secrets.

44
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:24,521
What's she doing here?

45
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:30,335
Just head back to the room.
All right? I'll take care of this.

46
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:32,529
Okay, make sure you do.
We're here to work.

47
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:45,645
If I jumped, would I survive?

48
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:50,422
With a clean dive, perhaps.

49
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:52,252
Mal, what are you doing here?

50
00:05:52,426 --> 00:05:54,621
I thought you might be missing me.

51
00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:56,055
You know that I am.

52
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,099
But I can't trust you anymore.

53
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:02,200
So what?

54
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:05,966
Looks like Arthur's taste.

55
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,769
Actually, the subject is partial
to postwar British painters.

56
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:13,174
Please, have a seat.

57
00:06:20,921 --> 00:06:22,354
Tell me...

58
00:06:22,756 --> 00:06:24,314
...do the children miss me?

59
00:06:28,662 --> 00:06:30,357
You can't imagine.

60
00:06:34,535 --> 00:06:35,627
What are you doing?

61
00:06:35,803 --> 00:06:37,327
Just getting some fresh air.

62
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:39,501
Stay where you are, Mal.

63
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,051
Goddamn it.

64
00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:58,475
Turn around.

65
00:07:58,652 --> 00:07:59,676
The gun, Dom.

66
00:08:08,963 --> 00:08:10,089
Please.

67
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,575
Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.

68
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:28,380
Did she tell you?
Or have you known all along?

69
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:33,776
That you're here to steal from me,
or that we are actually asleep?

70
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:40,291
I want to know the name
of your employer.

71
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:46,164
Ah, there's no use threatening him
in a dream, right, Mal?

72
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,801
That depends
on what you're threatening.

73
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:51,864
Killing him would just wake him up.

74
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,800
But pain...

75
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,645
Pain is in the mind.

76
00:09:00,347 --> 00:09:04,545
And judging by the decor,
we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?

77
00:09:15,963 --> 00:09:19,057
- What are you doing? It's too soon.
- But the dream's collapsing.

78
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:22,669
I'm gonna try to keep Saito under
a little bit longer. We're almost there.

79
00:09:36,884 --> 00:09:40,843
He was close. Very close.

80
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:56,727
Stop him!

81
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:24,724
This isn't gonna work. Wake him up.

82
00:10:45,552 --> 00:10:47,486
He won't wake.

83
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,256
- Give him the kick.
What?

84
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:54,818
Dunk him.

85
00:11:39,373 --> 00:11:40,738
He's out.

86
00:11:46,046 --> 00:11:48,105
You came prepared, hmm?

87
00:11:48,282 --> 00:11:52,116
Not even my head of security knows
this apartment. How did you find it?

88
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:56,484
It's difficult for a man of your position
to keep a love nest like this secret...

89
00:11:56,657 --> 00:11:59,182
...particularly where there's
a married woman involved.

90
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,327
- She would never...
- Yet here we are.

91
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:04,489
- With a dilemma.
- They're getting closer.

92
00:12:04,665 --> 00:12:07,429
- You got what you came for.
Well, that's not true.

93
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,263
You left out a key piece of information,
didn't you?

94
00:12:10,437 --> 00:12:13,634
You held something back
because you knew what we were up to.

95
00:12:13,807 --> 00:12:16,674
- Question is, why'd you let us in at all?
- An audition.

96
00:12:17,878 --> 00:12:20,813
- An audition for what?
- Doesn't matter. You failed.

97
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:23,677
We extracted every bit of information
you had in there.

98
00:12:24,084 --> 00:12:26,382
But your deception was obvious.

99
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:11,698
- So leave me and go.
- You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.

100
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:16,097
That corporation that hired us,
they won't accept failure.

101
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,397
We won't last two days.

102
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,534
Cobb?

103
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,836
Looks like I'm gonna have to do this
a little more simply.

104
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:28,778
Tell us what you know!
Tell us what you know, now!

105
00:13:32,152 --> 00:13:35,019
I've always hated this carpet.

106
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:39,558
It's stained and frayed
in such distinctive ways.

107
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:44,394
But very definitely made of wool.

108
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:46,927
Right now...

109
00:13:47,968 --> 00:13:50,402
...I'm lying on polyester.

110
00:13:54,274 --> 00:13:59,109
Which means I'm not lying
on my carpet, in my apartment.

111
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,245
You have lived up to your reputation,
Mr. Cobb.

112
00:14:03,684 --> 00:14:05,709
I'm still dreaming.

113
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:14,223
- How'd it go?
- Not good.

114
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:23,729
Dream within a dream, huh?
I'm impressed.

115
00:14:25,005 --> 00:14:28,497
But in my dream, you play by my rules.

116
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:30,939
Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito...

117
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:32,510
We're not in your dream.

118
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,237
We're in mine.

119
00:14:44,191 --> 00:14:46,284
Asshole.
How do you mess up the carpet?

120
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,758
- It wasn't my fault.
- You're the architect.

121
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,056
I didn't know
he was gonna rub his cheek on it!

122
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:52,323
That's enough.

123
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:54,957
You. What the hell was all that?

124
00:14:55,469 --> 00:14:58,336
- I have it under control.
- I'd hate to see you out of control.

125
00:14:58,505 --> 00:15:02,271
We don't have time for this.
I'm getting off at Kyoto.

126
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:04,273
He's not gonna check every compartment.

127
00:15:04,444 --> 00:15:06,071
Yeah, well, I don't like trains.

128
00:15:06,246 --> 00:15:09,010
Listen. Every man for himself.

129
00:16:23,356 --> 00:16:24,380
Yes, hello?

130
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:27,185
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, Dad.

131
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:31,323
Hey, guys. Hey. How are you?
How you doing, huh?

132
00:16:31,498 --> 00:16:33,728
Good.
Okay, I guess.

133
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,631
Okay? Who's just okay?
Is that you, James?

134
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:41,706
Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad?

135
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:47,339
Well, I can't, sweetheart. I can't.
Not for a while, remember?

136
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:48,845
Why?

137
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:54,745
Look, I told you, I'm away
because I'm working, right?

138
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,888
Grandma says you're never coming back.

139
00:16:58,558 --> 00:17:00,458
Phillipa, is that you?

140
00:17:01,428 --> 00:17:03,760
Put Grandma on the phone for me,
will you?

141
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,625
She's shaking her head.

142
00:17:07,768 --> 00:17:10,259
Well, just hope she's wrong about that.

143
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:12,332
Daddy?

144
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,063
Yeah, James?

145
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,902
Is Mommy with you?

146
00:17:18,545 --> 00:17:20,740
James, we talked about this.

147
00:17:22,048 --> 00:17:24,380
Mommy's not here anymore.

148
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:26,680
Where?

149
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:31,049
That's enough, kids. Say bye-bye.

150
00:17:31,224 --> 00:17:34,250
Listen, I'm gonna send some presents
with Grandpa, all right?

151
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:35,451
And you be good, you be-

152
00:17:45,972 --> 00:17:48,167
- Our ride's on the roof.
- Right.

153
00:17:55,348 --> 00:17:56,508
Hey, are you okay?

154
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,547
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

155
00:17:58,718 --> 00:18:01,152
Well, down in the dream,
Mal showing up.

156
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:04,552
Look, I'm, uh, sorry about your leg.
Won't happen again.

157
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:08,319
- It's getting worse, isn't it?
- One apology's all you're getting, all right?

158
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:10,963
- Where's Nash?
- He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?

159
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,599
We were supposed to deliver
Saito's expansion plans...

160
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:15,530
...to Cobol Engineering two hours ago.

161
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:18,933
By now, they know we failed.
It's time we disappear.

162
00:18:19,472 --> 00:18:21,963
- Where you gonna go?
- Buenos Aires.

163
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:26,408
I can lie low there, maybe sniff out
a job when things quiet down. You?

164
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,774
Stateside.

165
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,471
Send my regards.

166
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:39,383
He sold you out. Thought to come
to me and bargain for his life.

167
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:43,358
So I offer you the satisfaction.

168
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,825
It's not the way I deal with things.

169
00:19:02,115 --> 00:19:04,982
- What will you do with him?
- Nothing.

170
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:07,876
But I can't speak for Cobol Engineering.

171
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:25,394
- What do you want from us?
- Inception.

172
00:19:27,007 --> 00:19:29,407
- Is it possible?
- Of course not.

173
00:19:29,576 --> 00:19:31,771
If you can steal an idea
from someone's mind...

174
00:19:31,945 --> 00:19:33,810
...why can't you plant one there instead?

175
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,073
Okay, here's me planting
an idea in your head.

176
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:39,548
I say, "Don't think about elephants."
What are you thinking about?

177
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:40,743
Elephants.

178
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:44,084
Right. But it's not your idea,
because you know I gave it to you.

179
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:47,260
The subject's mind can always trace
the genesis of the idea.

180
00:19:47,427 --> 00:19:50,624
- True inspiration's impossible to fake.
- That's not true.

181
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:56,260
- Can you do it?
- Are you offering me a choice?

182
00:19:56,436 --> 00:19:59,098
Because I can find my own way
to square things with Cobol.

183
00:19:59,272 --> 00:20:01,297
Then you do have a choice.

184
00:20:01,474 --> 00:20:03,237
Then I choose to leave, sir.

185
00:20:08,148 --> 00:20:09,843
Tell the crew where you want to go.

186
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:16,179
Hey, Mr. Cobb.

187
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,418
How would you like to go home?

188
00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:25,527
To America. To your children.

189
00:20:25,966 --> 00:20:29,299
You can't fix that. No one can.

190
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:32,700
- Just like inception.
- Cobb, come on.

191
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,344
- How complex is the idea?
- Simple enough.

192
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:43,039
No idea is simple when you need
to plant it in somebody else's mind.

193
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,942
My main competitor is
an old man in poor health.

194
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,886
His son will soon inherit control
of the corporation.

195
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:55,352
I need him to decide to break up
his father's empire.

196
00:20:56,062 --> 00:20:58,724
- Cobb, we should walk away from this.
- Hold on.

197
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,065
If I were to do this,
if I even could do it...

198
00:21:04,237 --> 00:21:06,137
...I'd need a guarantee.

199
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,571
- How do I know you can deliver?
- You don't.

200
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:11,643
But I can.

201
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:16,807
So do you want to take a leap of faith...

202
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,084
...or become an old man,
filled with regret...

203
00:21:21,254 --> 00:21:23,848
...waiting to die alone?

204
00:21:26,926 --> 00:21:31,226
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.
And choose your people more wisely.

205
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,170
Look, I know how much
you wanna go home.

206
00:21:43,977 --> 00:21:45,706
This can't be done.

207
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:49,144
Yes, it can.
Just have to go deep enough.

208
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,873
You don't know that.

209
00:21:52,218 --> 00:21:54,049
I've done it before.

210
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:56,415
Who'd you do it to?

211
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:03,652
Why are we going to Paris?

212
00:22:05,265 --> 00:22:06,960
We're gonna need a new architect.

213
00:22:23,883 --> 00:22:25,942
You never did like your office, did you?

214
00:22:27,754 --> 00:22:30,780
No space to think
in that broom cupboard.

215
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:34,889
Is it safe for you to be here?

216
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:38,529
Extradition between France
and the United States...

217
00:22:38,698 --> 00:22:40,928
...is a bureaucratic nightmare,
you know that.

218
00:22:41,101 --> 00:22:43,831
I think they might find a way
to make it work in your case.

219
00:22:44,003 --> 00:22:48,497
Look, I, uh, brought these for you to give
to the kids when you have a chance.

220
00:22:48,675 --> 00:22:51,269
It'll take more than
the occasional stuffed animal...

221
00:22:51,444 --> 00:22:54,413
...to convince those children
they still have a father.

222
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,414
I'm just doing what I know.
I'm doing what you taught me.

223
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,108
I never taught you to be a thief.

224
00:22:59,285 --> 00:23:01,480
No, you taught me to navigate
people's minds.

225
00:23:01,654 --> 00:23:02,951
But after what happened...

226
00:23:03,123 --> 00:23:06,684
...there weren't a whole lot of legitimate
ways for me to use that skill.

227
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:13,321
What are you doing here, Dom?

228
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,835
I think I found a way home.

229
00:23:18,004 --> 00:23:21,565
It's a job
for some very, very powerful people.

230
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:26,211
People who I believe can fix
my charges permanently.

231
00:23:27,013 --> 00:23:28,275
But I need your help.

232
00:23:28,982 --> 00:23:32,281
You're here to corrupt
one of my brightest and best.

233
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:35,353
You know what I'm offering.
Let them decide for themselves.

234
00:23:35,522 --> 00:23:36,989
- Money.
- Not just money.

235
00:23:37,157 --> 00:23:38,488
You remember.

236
00:23:38,658 --> 00:23:41,889
It's the chance to build cathedrals,
entire cities...

237
00:23:42,061 --> 00:23:43,824
...things that never existed...

238
00:23:43,997 --> 00:23:47,194
...things that couldn't exist
in the real world.

239
00:23:47,367 --> 00:23:52,532
So you want me to let someone else
follow you into your fantasy?

240
00:23:52,705 --> 00:23:54,673
They don't actually come into the dream.

241
00:23:54,841 --> 00:23:58,106
They just design the levels
and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.

242
00:23:58,278 --> 00:23:59,506
Design it yourself.

243
00:24:02,182 --> 00:24:03,672
Mal won't let me.

244
00:24:09,889 --> 00:24:12,016
Come back to reality, Dom.

245
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,919
- Please.
- Reality.

246
00:24:16,296 --> 00:24:18,821
Those kids, your grandchildren...

247
00:24:18,998 --> 00:24:22,991
...they're waiting for their father to come
back home. That's their reality.

248
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:26,366
And this job, this last job,
that's how I get there.

249
00:24:26,906 --> 00:24:30,535
I would not be standing here
if I knew any other way.

250
00:24:33,713 --> 00:24:36,614
I need an architect
who's as good as I was.

251
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,811
I've got somebody better.

252
00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:44,013
Ariadne?

253
00:24:46,626 --> 00:24:49,151
I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.

254
00:24:49,562 --> 00:24:50,654
Pleased to meet you.

255
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:55,494
If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has
a job offer he'd like to discuss with you.

256
00:24:55,668 --> 00:24:56,692
A work placement?

257
00:24:57,103 --> 00:24:58,400
Not exactly.

258
00:24:58,571 --> 00:24:59,902
I have a test for you.

259
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,699
You're not gonna tell me anything first?

260
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:05,503
Before I describe the job,
I have to know you can do it.

261
00:25:05,678 --> 00:25:08,875
- Why?
- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.

262
00:25:11,985 --> 00:25:16,649
You have two minutes to design a maze
that it takes one minute to solve.

263
00:25:18,591 --> 00:25:19,717
Stop.

264
00:25:22,161 --> 00:25:23,355
Again.

265
00:25:25,498 --> 00:25:26,829
Stop.

266
00:25:30,003 --> 00:25:32,062
You're gonna have to do better than that.

267
00:25:45,084 --> 00:25:46,346
That's more like it.

268
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:09,440
They say we only use a fraction
of our brain's true potential.

269
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,304
Now, that's when we're awake.

270
00:26:11,477 --> 00:26:14,446
When we're asleep,
our mind can do almost anything.

271
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,638
Such as?

272
00:26:15,815 --> 00:26:19,808
Imagine you're designing a building.
You consciously create each aspect.

273
00:26:19,986 --> 00:26:23,820
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost
creating itself, if you know what I mean.

274
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,958
Yeah, like I'm discovering it.

275
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,389
Genuine inspiration, right?

276
00:26:28,561 --> 00:26:31,894
Now, in a dream,
our mind continuously does this.

277
00:26:32,065 --> 00:26:36,695
We create and perceive
our world simultaneously.

278
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:40,270
And our mind does this so well
that we don't even know it's happening.

279
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,170
That allows us to get right
in the middle of that process.

280
00:26:43,343 --> 00:26:45,709
- How?
- By taking over the creating part.

281
00:26:45,878 --> 00:26:47,505
Now, this is where I need you.

282
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,046
You create the world of the dream.

283
00:26:50,216 --> 00:26:55,586
We bring the subject into that dream,
and they fill it with their subconscious.

284
00:26:55,755 --> 00:27:00,419
How could I ever acquire enough detail
to make them think that it's reality?

285
00:27:00,593 --> 00:27:04,051
Well, dreams, they feel real
while we're in them, right?

286
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,927
It's only when we wake up that we realize
something was actually strange.

287
00:27:09,402 --> 00:27:10,801
Let me ask you a question.

288
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:14,371
You never really remember
the beginning of a dream, do you?

289
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:17,566
You always wind up
right in the middle of what's going on.

290
00:27:17,744 --> 00:27:18,768
I guess, yeah.

291
00:27:18,945 --> 00:27:20,503
So how did we end up here?

292
00:27:20,913 --> 00:27:22,972
Well, we just came from the, uh...

293
00:27:23,182 --> 00:27:26,618
Think about it, Ariadne.
How did you get here?

294
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,120
Where are you right now?

295
00:27:32,425 --> 00:27:33,585
We're dreaming?

296
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,194
You're in the middle
of the workshop, sleeping.

297
00:27:36,362 --> 00:27:39,331
This is your first lesson
in shared dreaming. Stay calm.

298
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:18,796
If it's just a dream,
then why are you-?

299
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,169
Because it's never just a dream, is it?

300
00:28:22,341 --> 00:28:25,640
And a face full of glass hurts like hell.
When you're in it, it feels real.

301
00:28:25,812 --> 00:28:28,007
That's why the military
developed dream sharing.

302
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:31,878
It was a training program for soldiers
to shoot, stab and strangle each other...

303
00:28:32,051 --> 00:28:33,177
...and then wake up.

304
00:28:33,486 --> 00:28:35,283
How did architects become involved?

305
00:28:35,455 --> 00:28:38,185
Well, someone had to design
the dreams, right?

306
00:28:39,325 --> 00:28:41,657
Why don't you give us
another five minutes?

307
00:28:41,828 --> 00:28:42,920
Five minutes?

308
00:28:44,297 --> 00:28:46,629
What-? We were talking
for, like, at least an hour.

309
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,029
In a dream, your mind
functions more quickly...

310
00:28:49,202 --> 00:28:52,035
...therefore time seems
to feel more slow.

311
00:28:52,205 --> 00:28:55,572
Five minutes in the real world
gives you an hour in the dream.

312
00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:59,369
Why don't you see what you
can get up to in five minutes?

313
00:29:05,284 --> 00:29:08,219
You've got the basic layout.
Bookstore, café.

314
00:29:08,387 --> 00:29:10,048
Almost everything else is here too.

315
00:29:10,223 --> 00:29:13,158
Who are the people?
- Projections of my subconscious.

316
00:29:13,326 --> 00:29:14,486
- Yours?
- Yes.

317
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,185
Remember, you are the dreamer.
You build this world.

318
00:29:17,363 --> 00:29:20,025
I am the subject. My mind populates it.

319
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:22,099
You can literally talk
to my subconscious.

320
00:29:22,268 --> 00:29:25,169
That's one of the ways we extract
information from the subject.

321
00:29:25,338 --> 00:29:26,600
How else do you do it?

322
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:30,765
By creating something secure,
like a bank vault or a jail.

323
00:29:30,943 --> 00:29:34,674
The mind automatically fills it
with information it's trying to protect.

324
00:29:34,847 --> 00:29:37,611
- You understand?
- Then you break in and steal it?

325
00:29:37,783 --> 00:29:38,807
Well...

326
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:43,479
I guess I thought that the dream space
would be all about the visual...

327
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,521
...but it's more about the feel of it.

328
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:50,122
My question is what happens when you
start messing with the physics of it all?

329
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,028
It's something, isn't it?

330
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,437
Yes, it is.

331
00:30:59,365 --> 00:31:00,889
Why are they all looking at me?

332
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:04,559
Because my subconscious feels that
someone else is creating this world.

333
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:09,037
The more you change things, the quicker
the projections start to converge on you.

334
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:10,266
Converge?

335
00:31:10,443 --> 00:31:12,502
They sense the foreign nature
of the dreamer.

336
00:31:12,678 --> 00:31:15,340
They attack, like white blood cells
fighting an infection.

337
00:31:15,514 --> 00:31:18,347
- What, they're gonna attack us?
- No, no.

338
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,476
Just you.

339
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:28,656
This is great, but I'm telling you,
if you keep changing things like this...

340
00:31:32,164 --> 00:31:35,133
Jeez, mind telling your subconscious
to take it easy?

341
00:31:35,301 --> 00:31:37,963
It's my subconscious.
Remember? I can't control it.

342
00:32:31,624 --> 00:32:32,989
Very impressive.

343
00:32:44,737 --> 00:32:48,264
I know this bridge.
This place is real, isn't it?

344
00:32:48,441 --> 00:32:50,773
Yeah, I cross it every day
to get to the college.

345
00:32:50,943 --> 00:32:54,379
Never re-create places from your memory.
Always imagine new places.

346
00:32:54,547 --> 00:32:56,378
You draw from stuff you know, right?

347
00:32:56,549 --> 00:33:00,747
Only use details. A streetlamp
or a phone booth. Never entire areas.

348
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,047
- Why not?
- Building a dream from your memory...

349
00:33:03,222 --> 00:33:06,714
...is the easiest way to lose your grasp
on what's real and what is a dream.

350
00:33:06,892 --> 00:33:08,951
- Is that what happened to you?
- Listen to me.

351
00:33:09,128 --> 00:33:11,119
This has nothing to do
with me, understand?

352
00:33:11,297 --> 00:33:13,265
That why you need me
to build your dreams?

353
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:15,957
Hey, get off of her. Back up. Back up.

354
00:33:16,135 --> 00:33:17,762
- Cobb! Cobb!
- Get off of her!

355
00:33:17,937 --> 00:33:19,871
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Mal!

356
00:33:20,372 --> 00:33:22,465
- Mal!
- Cobb! Wake me up!

357
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:24,438
- Wake me up! Wake me up!
- No!

358
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,100
- Mal, no! No!
- Wake me up!

359
00:33:27,747 --> 00:33:31,706
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.
You're okay. You're okay.

360
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:35,115
- Hey.
- Why wouldn't I wake up?

361
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:37,013
There was still time on the clock.

362
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:39,714
You can't wake up from
within the dream unless you die.

363
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,484
- She'll need a totem.
What?

364
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,127
A totem, it's a small personal-

365
00:33:43,295 --> 00:33:45,820
That's some subconscious
you've got on you, Cobb!

366
00:33:45,998 --> 00:33:47,829
- She's a real charmer.
- Oh.

367
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,628
- I see you met Mrs. Cobb.
- She's his wife?

368
00:33:50,803 --> 00:33:54,534
Yeah. So a totem. You need
a small object, potentially heavy.

369
00:33:54,707 --> 00:33:57,175
Something you can have on you
that no one else knows.

370
00:33:57,343 --> 00:33:58,605
Like a coin?
No.

371
00:33:58,778 --> 00:34:03,408
It needs to be more unique than that.
Like, this is a loaded die.

372
00:34:04,517 --> 00:34:07,418
No, I can't let you touch it.
That would defeat the purpose.

373
00:34:07,586 --> 00:34:11,784
See, only I know the balance and
the weight of this particular loaded die.

374
00:34:11,957 --> 00:34:13,788
That way,
when you look at your totem...

375
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:17,053
...you know beyond a doubt that
you're not in someone else's dream.

376
00:34:20,499 --> 00:34:24,799
I don't know if you can't see what's
going on, or if you just don't want to...

377
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:28,497
...but Cobb has some serious problems
that he's tried to bury down there.

378
00:34:28,674 --> 00:34:32,610
And I'm not about to just open my mind
to someone like that.

379
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:42,152
She'll be back. I've never seen anyone
pick it up that quickly before.

380
00:34:42,621 --> 00:34:46,819
Reality's not gonna be enough for her now,
and when she comes back...

381
00:34:47,493 --> 00:34:50,155
When she comes back,
you're gonna have her building mazes.

382
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:52,593
- Where are you gonna be?
- I gotta go visit Eames.

383
00:34:52,765 --> 00:34:55,893
Eames? No, he's in Mombasa.
It's Cobol's back yard.

384
00:34:56,068 --> 00:34:57,660
It's a necessary risk.

385
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:01,301
- Well, there's plenty of good thieves.
- We don't just need a thief.

386
00:35:02,441 --> 00:35:03,465
We need a forger.

387
00:35:12,184 --> 00:35:14,744
Rub them together all you want,
they're not gonna breed.

388
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,345
You never know.

389
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:19,314
I'm gonna get you a drink.

390
00:35:21,493 --> 00:35:22,858
You're buying.

391
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,633
- Your spelling hasn't improved.
- Piss off.

392
00:35:31,804 --> 00:35:33,772
How's your handwriting?

393
00:35:33,939 --> 00:35:35,770
- It's versatile.
- Good.

394
00:35:35,941 --> 00:35:37,169
Thank you very much.

395
00:35:37,843 --> 00:35:39,208
Inception.

396
00:35:39,445 --> 00:35:42,278
Now, before you bother telling me
it's impossible, let me-

397
00:35:42,448 --> 00:35:45,747
No, it's perfectly possible.
It's just bloody difficult.

398
00:35:45,918 --> 00:35:49,183
Interesting. Because Arthur keeps
telling me it can't be done.

399
00:35:49,622 --> 00:35:52,591
Hmm. Arthur. You still working
with that stick in the mud?

400
00:35:52,758 --> 00:35:54,453
He is good at what he does, right?

401
00:35:54,627 --> 00:35:56,686
Oh, he's the best,
but he has no imagination.

402
00:35:56,862 --> 00:35:57,886
Not like you.

403
00:35:58,063 --> 00:36:01,032
Listen, if you're gonna perform inception,
you need imagination.

404
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,761
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it before?

405
00:36:04,937 --> 00:36:08,566
We tried it. Uh, we got the idea in place,
but it didn't take.

406
00:36:08,741 --> 00:36:12,074
- You didn't plant it deep enough?
- No, it's not just about depth.

407
00:36:12,244 --> 00:36:14,235
You need the simplest version
of the idea...

408
00:36:14,413 --> 00:36:18,076
...in order for it to grow naturally
in your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.

409
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,775
So, what is this idea
that you need to plant?

410
00:36:20,953 --> 00:36:25,151
We need the heir of a major corporation
to dissolve his father's empire.

411
00:36:25,324 --> 00:36:27,758
Right there you have
various political motivations...

412
00:36:27,927 --> 00:36:29,918
...and anti-monopolistic sentiments
and so forth.

413
00:36:30,095 --> 00:36:31,926
But all of that stuff, it's, um...

414
00:36:32,097 --> 00:36:34,964
It's really at the mercy of your
subject's prejudice, you see?

415
00:36:35,134 --> 00:36:37,625
What you have to do is
start at the absolute basic.

416
00:36:37,803 --> 00:36:39,361
Which is what?

417
00:36:39,872 --> 00:36:41,772
The relationship with the father.

418
00:36:43,976 --> 00:36:45,637
- Do you have a chemist?
- No, not yet.

419
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:48,871
Right. Okay, well,
there's a man here, Yusuf.

420
00:36:49,048 --> 00:36:52,484
He, uh, formulates his own versions
of the compounds.

421
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:53,948
Why don't you take me there?

422
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:57,179
Once you've lost your tail.
The man at the bar.

423
00:36:57,356 --> 00:36:58,823
Cobol Engineering.

424
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:01,323
That price on my head,
was that dead or alive?

425
00:37:01,493 --> 00:37:04,018
Don't remember.
Let's see if he starts shooting.

426
00:37:04,196 --> 00:37:07,825
Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs
in the bar in, say, uh, half an hour?

427
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,991
- Back here?
- This is the last place they'd suspect.

428
00:37:12,538 --> 00:37:13,869
All right.

429
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,871
Freddy. Freddy Simmonds.

430
00:37:17,042 --> 00:37:18,509
My God, it's you, isn't it?

431
00:37:22,047 --> 00:37:23,105
No, it isn't you.

432
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,715
Not dreaming now, are you?

433
00:37:26,919 --> 00:37:28,511
Get him!

434
00:37:44,036 --> 00:37:45,162
There!

435
00:38:05,657 --> 00:38:07,420
One café.

436
00:38:11,764 --> 00:38:12,924
Shh.

437
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,037
One café.

438
00:38:21,073 --> 00:38:22,540
One café.

439
00:39:17,129 --> 00:39:18,596
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

440
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:24,295
- What are you doing in Mombasa?
- I'm here to protect my investment.

441
00:39:26,805 --> 00:39:29,740
Ah. So this is your idea
of losing a tail, huh?

442
00:39:29,908 --> 00:39:30,932
Different tail.

443
00:39:39,651 --> 00:39:41,380
Cobb said you'd be back.

444
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:46,048
- I tried not to come, but...
- But there's nothing quite like it.

445
00:39:46,225 --> 00:39:47,886
It's just...

446
00:39:49,394 --> 00:39:50,725
...pure creation.

447
00:39:50,896 --> 00:39:53,387
Shall we take a look
at some paradoxical architecture?

448
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:55,556
You're gonna have to master
a few tricks...

449
00:39:55,734 --> 00:39:59,261
...if you're gonna build three complete
dream levels. Excuse me.

450
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,871
What kind of tricks?

451
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:04,531
In a dream, you can cheat architecture
into impossible shapes.

452
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:08,612
That lets you create closed loops,
like the Penrose Steps.

453
00:40:09,481 --> 00:40:11,472
The infinite staircase.

454
00:40:14,186 --> 00:40:15,619
See?

455
00:40:19,791 --> 00:40:20,849
Paradox.

456
00:40:21,026 --> 00:40:22,425
So a closed loop like that...

457
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:25,688
...will help you disguise the boundaries
of the dream you create.

458
00:40:25,864 --> 00:40:27,832
But how big do these levels have to be?

459
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,128
It could be anything
from the floor of a building to an entire city.

460
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:34,739
They have to be complicated enough
that we can hide from the projections.

461
00:40:34,907 --> 00:40:36,306
- A maze?
- Right, a maze.

462
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,806
And the better the maze...

463
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,672
Then the longer we have
before the projections catch us?

464
00:40:40,846 --> 00:40:42,108
Exactly.

465
00:40:42,781 --> 00:40:46,410
- My subconscious seems polite enough.
- Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly.

466
00:40:46,585 --> 00:40:49,486
No one likes to feel someone else
messing around in their mind.

467
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,748
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?

468
00:40:53,592 --> 00:40:55,423
I don't know if he can't, but he won't.

469
00:40:55,594 --> 00:40:57,994
He thinks it's safer
if he doesn't know the layouts.

470
00:40:58,163 --> 00:40:59,255
Why?

471
00:40:59,431 --> 00:41:01,661
He won't tell me. But I think it's Mal.

472
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,398
- His ex-wife?
- No, not his ex.

473
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:07,733
- They're still together?
- No.

474
00:41:08,974 --> 00:41:10,464
No, she's dead.

475
00:41:12,444 --> 00:41:15,174
What you see in there
is just his projection of her.

476
00:41:18,717 --> 00:41:20,184
What was she like in real life?

477
00:41:20,852 --> 00:41:22,376
She was lovely.

478
00:41:26,091 --> 00:41:28,457
You are seeking a chemist?
Yes.

479
00:41:28,627 --> 00:41:30,754
To formulate compounds for a job?

480
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:33,295
And to go into the field with us.

481
00:41:33,465 --> 00:41:35,695
No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.

482
00:41:35,867 --> 00:41:39,598
Well, we'd need you there to tailor
compounds specific to our needs.

483
00:41:39,771 --> 00:41:41,864
- Which are?
- Great depth.

484
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,305
A dream within a dream? Two levels?

485
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,104
Three.

486
00:41:49,281 --> 00:41:52,842
Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams is too unstable.

487
00:41:53,018 --> 00:41:56,977
It is possible.
You just have to add a sedative.

488
00:41:57,155 --> 00:41:59,817
A powerful sedative.

489
00:42:01,627 --> 00:42:03,857
- How many team members?
- Five.

490
00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:05,758
Six.

491
00:42:06,632 --> 00:42:10,659
The only way to know you've done the job
is if I go in with you.

492
00:42:10,836 --> 00:42:13,930
There's no room for tourists
on a job like this, Mr. Saito.

493
00:42:14,106 --> 00:42:16,472
This time, it seems there is.

494
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:21,140
This, I think, is a good place to start.
I use it every day.

495
00:42:21,313 --> 00:42:23,440
What for?
- Here, I'll show you.

496
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,482
Perhaps you will not want to see.

497
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,016
After you.

498
00:42:43,335 --> 00:42:46,327
Ten. Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell.

499
00:42:46,505 --> 00:42:48,268
They come every day to share the dream.

500
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,870
You see? Very stable.

501
00:42:59,584 --> 00:43:03,645
- How long do they dream for?
Three, four hours, each day.

502
00:43:03,922 --> 00:43:04,946
In dream time?

503
00:43:05,123 --> 00:43:08,786
With this compound? About 40 hours,
each and every day.

504
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,259
- Why do they do it?
Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

505
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:16,233
After a while, it becomes
the only way you can dream.

506
00:43:16,401 --> 00:43:18,335
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

507
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:22,371
- They come here every day to sleep?
No.

508
00:43:24,109 --> 00:43:26,805
They come to be woken up.

509
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:31,112
The dream has become their reality.

510
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:34,416
Who are you to say otherwise, sir?

511
00:43:36,722 --> 00:43:38,349
Let's see what you can do.

512
00:43:49,334 --> 00:43:50,926
You know how to find me.

513
00:43:53,538 --> 00:43:55,529
You know what you have to do.

514
00:44:00,779 --> 00:44:01,837
Sharp, no?

515
00:44:17,429 --> 00:44:20,262
Are you all right, Mr. Cobb?

516
00:44:20,799 --> 00:44:24,565
Yeah, yeah. Everything's just fine.

517
00:44:33,011 --> 00:44:36,708
Robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer Morrow
energy conglomerate.

518
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,782
What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?

519
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,542
That's not your concern.

520
00:44:40,952 --> 00:44:45,321
Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical
corporate espionage.

521
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:47,082
You asked me for inception.

522
00:44:47,259 --> 00:44:50,626
I do hope you understand
the gravity of that request.

523
00:44:50,796 --> 00:44:54,755
Now, the seed that we plant
in this man's mind will grow into an idea.

524
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:56,798
This idea will define him.

525
00:44:56,968 --> 00:44:58,799
It may come to change...

526
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:01,268
Well, it may come to change
everything about him.

527
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,774
We're the last company standing
between them and total energy dominance.

528
00:45:05,944 --> 00:45:08,003
And we can no longer compete.

529
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:11,638
Soon, they'll control the energy supply
of half the world.

530
00:45:11,817 --> 00:45:14,183
In effect, they become
a new superpower.

531
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:18,920
The world needs Robert Fischer
to change his mind.

532
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,648
That's where we come in.

533
00:45:20,826 --> 00:45:24,091
How is Robert Fischer's relationship
with his father?

534
00:45:24,262 --> 00:45:26,992
Rumor is the relationship
is quite complicated.

535
00:45:27,165 --> 00:45:29,656
Well, we can't work based
solely on rumor, can we?

536
00:45:29,835 --> 00:45:33,032
Can you get me access to this man here?
Browning.

537
00:45:33,205 --> 00:45:37,369
Fischer Senior's right-hand man.
Fischer Junior's godfather.

538
00:45:37,542 --> 00:45:40,807
It should be possible,
if you can get the right references.

539
00:45:40,979 --> 00:45:45,439
References are something
of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

540
00:45:46,084 --> 00:45:49,019
I'm not smelling
settlement here. Take them down.

541
00:45:49,187 --> 00:45:50,279
Mr. Browning...

542
00:45:50,455 --> 00:45:54,289
...Maurice Fischer's policy
is always one of avoiding litigation.

543
00:45:56,862 --> 00:46:01,322
Well, shall we voice your concerns
with Maurice directly?

544
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,899
Not sure that's necessary.

545
00:46:03,068 --> 00:46:05,730
No, no, no. I think we should.

546
00:46:27,025 --> 00:46:28,583
How is he?

547
00:46:29,427 --> 00:46:32,191
I don't want to bother him
unnecessarily, but-

548
00:46:32,364 --> 00:46:37,825
Robert, I told you keep out
the damn- Wait. So do it. Get-

549
00:46:38,103 --> 00:46:41,197
Mr. Fischer.
Put it through.

550
00:46:41,573 --> 00:46:45,168
Never, never.
Never do the same as I asked.

551
00:46:46,478 --> 00:46:48,139
Leave that.

552
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,215
Here.

553
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,887
Must be a cherished memory of his.

554
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:03,518
I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.

555
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:05,356
Robert...

556
00:47:07,732 --> 00:47:10,132
...we need to talk about
a power of attorney.

557
00:47:10,302 --> 00:47:13,601
- I know this is hard, but it's imperative-
- Not now, Uncle Peter.

558
00:47:17,609 --> 00:47:19,406
The vultures are circling.

559
00:47:19,578 --> 00:47:23,981
And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,
the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.

560
00:47:24,149 --> 00:47:26,549
I've had ample opportunity
to observe Browning...

561
00:47:27,185 --> 00:47:31,554
...and adopt his physical presence, study his
mannerisms, and so on and so forth.

562
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:35,591
So now in the first layer of the dream,
I can impersonate Browning.

563
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,991
And suggest concepts
to Fischer's conscious mind.

564
00:47:39,164 --> 00:47:40,995
Then, when we take him
a level deeper...

565
00:47:41,166 --> 00:47:44,658
...his own projection of Browning
should feed that right back to him.

566
00:47:44,836 --> 00:47:46,770
So he gives himself the idea.

567
00:47:46,938 --> 00:47:51,170
Precisely. That's the only way it will stick.
It has to seem self-generated.

568
00:47:51,343 --> 00:47:54,744
Eames, I am impressed.

569
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:58,474
Your condescension, as always,
is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.

570
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:21,829
Were you going under on your own?

571
00:48:22,007 --> 00:48:25,499
No, no, I was just, uh, running
some experiments.

572
00:48:25,677 --> 00:48:27,645
I didn't realize anyone was here, so...

573
00:48:27,812 --> 00:48:30,474
Yeah, I was just-
I was working on my totem, actually.

574
00:48:30,649 --> 00:48:31,809
Here, let me take a look.

575
00:48:33,985 --> 00:48:35,282
So you're learning, huh?

576
00:48:35,453 --> 00:48:38,945
An elegant solution
for keeping track of reality.

577
00:48:39,591 --> 00:48:41,991
- Was it your idea?
- No, it was, uh...

578
00:48:42,227 --> 00:48:44,286
It was Mal's, actually. This...

579
00:48:44,996 --> 00:48:48,762
This one was hers. She would spin it
in the dream and it would never topple.

580
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,868
Just spin and spin.

581
00:48:53,405 --> 00:48:55,339
Arthur told me she passed away.

582
00:48:57,242 --> 00:48:59,301
How are the mazes coming along?

583
00:48:59,477 --> 00:49:02,378
Each level relates to the part
of the subject's subconscious...

584
00:49:02,547 --> 00:49:04,014
...that we are trying to access.

585
00:49:04,182 --> 00:49:09,620
So I'm making the bottom level a hospital,
so Fischer will bring his father.

586
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:12,752
You know, l- Actually, I have a question
about this layout.

587
00:49:12,924 --> 00:49:17,657
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout.

588
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:18,989
Why is that so important?

589
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:21,155
In case one of us brings in
our projections.

590
00:49:21,332 --> 00:49:23,664
We don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.

591
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:27,538
You mean in case you bring Mal in.

592
00:49:27,706 --> 00:49:30,106
You can't keep her out, can you?

593
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,533
- Right.
- You can't build...

594
00:49:32,711 --> 00:49:36,010
...because if you know the maze,
then she knows it.

595
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,376
Well, she'd sabotage
the whole operation.

596
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:41,348
- Cobb, do the others know?
- No. No, they don't.

597
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:43,749
You've gotta warn them
if this is getting worse.

598
00:49:43,922 --> 00:49:45,856
No one said it's getting worse.

599
00:49:47,058 --> 00:49:50,357
I need to get home.
That's all I care about right now.

600
00:49:51,229 --> 00:49:53,288
Why can't you go home?

601
00:49:56,401 --> 00:49:58,426
Because they think I killed her.

602
00:50:01,673 --> 00:50:03,937
- Thank you.
- For what?

603
00:50:04,142 --> 00:50:06,406
For not asking whether I did.

604
00:50:06,578 --> 00:50:08,739
"I will split up my father's empire."

605
00:50:08,913 --> 00:50:13,111
Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...

606
00:50:13,284 --> 00:50:16,082
...which is why we need to plant it deep
in his subconscious.

607
00:50:16,254 --> 00:50:19,781
The subconscious is motivated
by emotion, right? Not reason.

608
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:23,724
We need to find a way to translate this
into an emotional concept.

609
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:26,329
How do you translate business strategy
into emotion?

610
00:50:26,498 --> 00:50:30,093
That's what we're here to figure out.
Robert's relationship with his father...

611
00:50:30,268 --> 00:50:32,998
...is stressed, to say the least.
- Can we run with that?

612
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:36,766
We suggest breaking up his father's
company as a "screw you" to the old man.

613
00:50:36,941 --> 00:50:40,399
No, because I think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.

614
00:50:40,812 --> 00:50:44,509
We all yearn for reconciliation,
for catharsis.

615
00:50:44,682 --> 00:50:48,448
We need Robert Fischer to have
a positive emotional reaction to all this.

616
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,451
All right, well, try this. Um...

617
00:50:50,622 --> 00:50:55,355
"My father accepts that I want to create
for myself, not follow in his footsteps."

618
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,818
That might work.

619
00:50:56,995 --> 00:51:00,158
Might? We're gonna need to do
a little better than "might."

620
00:51:00,331 --> 00:51:02,299
Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.

621
00:51:02,467 --> 00:51:05,402
Forgive me for wanting
a little specificity, Eames.

622
00:51:05,603 --> 00:51:06,695
Specificity?

623
00:51:06,871 --> 00:51:08,702
Inception's not about being specific.

624
00:51:08,873 --> 00:51:12,832
When we get inside his mind, we're
gonna have to work with what we find.

625
00:51:14,145 --> 00:51:17,137
On the top level, we open up
his relationship with his father...

626
00:51:17,315 --> 00:51:20,375
...and say, "I will not follow
in my father's footsteps."

627
00:51:20,552 --> 00:51:25,216
Then the next level down, we feed him,
"I will create something for myself."

628
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:28,723
Then, by the time we hit the bottom level,
we bring out the big guns.

629
00:51:28,893 --> 00:51:31,293
- "My father doesn't want me to be him."
Exactly.

630
00:51:32,664 --> 00:51:36,657
Three layers down, the dreams are gonna
collapse with the slightest disturbance.

631
00:51:36,835 --> 00:51:37,995
Sedation.

632
00:51:38,169 --> 00:51:41,002
For sleep stable enough to create
three layers of dreaming...

633
00:51:41,172 --> 00:51:45,074
...we'll have to combine it with
an extremely powerful sedative.

634
00:51:56,521 --> 00:51:57,579
Good night.

635
00:51:58,189 --> 00:52:00,384
The compound we'll be using
to share the dream...

636
00:52:00,558 --> 00:52:02,492
...creates a clear connection
between dreamers...

637
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:06,892
...whilst accelerating brain function.
- In other words, more time on each level.

638
00:52:07,065 --> 00:52:10,228
Brain function in the dream will be
about 20 times normal.

639
00:52:10,401 --> 00:52:13,893
And when you enter a dream within
that dream, the effect is compounded.

640
00:52:14,072 --> 00:52:16,165
It's three dreams,
that's 10 hours times 20-

641
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:19,242
Math was never my strong subject.
How much time is that?

642
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:22,072
It's a week, the first level down.

643
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,613
Six months the second level down,
and the third level-

644
00:52:25,783 --> 00:52:27,216
That's 10 years.

645
00:52:29,854 --> 00:52:32,015
Who'd wanna be stuck
in a dream for 10 years?

646
00:52:32,423 --> 00:52:33,583
Depends on the dream.

647
00:52:33,758 --> 00:52:36,056
So once we've made the plant,
how do we get out?

648
00:52:36,227 --> 00:52:39,560
I'm hoping you have something more
elegant than shooting me in the head.

649
00:52:39,731 --> 00:52:42,495
- A kick.
- What's a kick?

650
00:52:42,667 --> 00:52:45,363
This, Ariadne, would be a kick.

651
00:52:47,505 --> 00:52:50,201
It's that feeling of falling you get
that jolts you awake.

652
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:53,606
- Snaps you out of the dream.
- We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?

653
00:52:53,778 --> 00:52:54,972
That's the clever part.

654
00:52:55,146 --> 00:52:58,377
I customized the sedative to leave
inner-ear function unimpaired.

655
00:52:58,549 --> 00:53:03,384
That way, however deep the sleep,
the sleeper still feels falling.

656
00:53:03,554 --> 00:53:05,920
Or tipping.

657
00:53:06,557 --> 00:53:10,721
The trick is to synchronize a kick
that can penetrate all three levels.

658
00:53:11,262 --> 00:53:14,789
We could use a musical countdown
to synchronize the different kicks.

659
00:53:22,674 --> 00:53:26,166
He hasn't got any surgery
scheduled, no dental, nothing.

660
00:53:26,344 --> 00:53:28,335
Wasn't he supposed to have
a knee operation?

661
00:53:28,513 --> 00:53:31,744
Nothing. Nothing that they'll
put him under for, anyway. And we need-

662
00:53:31,916 --> 00:53:33,850
We need at least a good 10 hours.

663
00:53:34,018 --> 00:53:35,349
Sydney to Los Angeles.

664
00:53:36,688 --> 00:53:40,954
One of the longest flights in the world.
He makes it every two weeks.

665
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:43,286
He must be flying private, then.

666
00:53:43,795 --> 00:53:46,958
Not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his plane.

667
00:53:47,131 --> 00:53:49,361
It would have to be a 747.
- Why's that?

668
00:53:49,534 --> 00:53:51,001
On a 747, the pilot's up top...

669
00:53:51,169 --> 00:53:54,366
...the first-class cabin's in the nose,
so no one would walk through.

670
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:58,031
You'd have to buy out the entire cabin
and the first-class flight attendant.

671
00:53:58,209 --> 00:53:59,767
I bought the airline.

672
00:54:01,346 --> 00:54:03,143
It seemed neater.

673
00:54:04,749 --> 00:54:07,547
Well, looks like we have our 10 hours.

674
00:54:08,219 --> 00:54:11,347
Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way.

675
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:01,531
You know how to find me.

676
00:55:03,007 --> 00:55:04,440
You know what you have to do.

677
00:55:08,279 --> 00:55:11,737
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

678
00:55:12,617 --> 00:55:14,642
Of course I do.

679
00:55:15,753 --> 00:55:18,244
You said you had a dream.

680
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:23,956
That we'd grow old together.

681
00:55:25,396 --> 00:55:27,091
And we can.

682
00:55:33,771 --> 00:55:35,705
You shouldn't be here.

683
00:55:39,477 --> 00:55:42,935
Just wanted to see what kind of tests
you're doing on your own every night.

684
00:55:43,114 --> 00:55:46,311
- This has nothing to do with you.
- This has everything to do with me.

685
00:55:46,484 --> 00:55:52,286
- You've asked me to share dreams with you.
- Not these. These are my dreams.

686
00:56:03,167 --> 00:56:05,567
Why do you do this to yourself?

687
00:56:05,736 --> 00:56:08,671
It's the only way I can still dream.

688
00:56:10,441 --> 00:56:12,636
Why is it so important to dream?

689
00:56:13,544 --> 00:56:15,808
In my dreams, we're still together.

690
00:56:30,161 --> 00:56:31,890
These aren't just dreams.

691
00:56:33,698 --> 00:56:36,724
These are memories.
And you said never to use memories.

692
00:56:36,901 --> 00:56:37,959
I know I did.

693
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:43,131
You're trying to keep her alive.
You can't let her go.

694
00:56:43,307 --> 00:56:46,299
You don't understand.
These are moments I regret.

695
00:56:46,477 --> 00:56:49,037
They're memories that I have to change.

696
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,749
Well, what's down there that you regret?

697
00:56:53,151 --> 00:56:56,279
Listen, there's only one thing
you need to understand about me.

698
00:57:04,762 --> 00:57:06,354
This is your house?

699
00:57:07,031 --> 00:57:09,499
Mine and Mal's, yes.

700
00:57:09,667 --> 00:57:11,362
Where is she?

701
00:57:12,036 --> 00:57:14,027
She's already gone.

702
00:57:18,776 --> 00:57:20,300
That's my son, James.

703
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:23,572
He's digging for something,
maybe a worm.

704
00:57:24,949 --> 00:57:26,075
That's Phillipa.

705
00:57:26,617 --> 00:57:28,482
I thought about calling out to them...

706
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:31,417
...so they'd turn and smile
and I could see...

707
00:57:32,123 --> 00:57:37,254
...those beautiful faces of theirs,
but it's all too late.

708
00:57:37,428 --> 00:57:40,261
Right now or never, Cobb.

709
00:57:44,735 --> 00:57:46,532
Then I start to panic.

710
00:57:46,704 --> 00:57:49,400
I realize I'm gonna regret this moment...

711
00:57:50,241 --> 00:57:52,573
...that I need to see their faces
one last time.

712
00:57:52,743 --> 00:57:55,234
James! Phillipa! Come on in!

713
00:57:55,413 --> 00:57:57,438
But the moment's past.

714
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:03,017
And whatever I do,
I can't change this moment.

715
00:58:03,921 --> 00:58:06,082
As I'm about to call out to them...

716
00:58:07,124 --> 00:58:08,216
...they run away.

717
00:58:10,962 --> 00:58:14,227
If I'm ever gonna see their faces again,
I've gotta get back home.

718
00:58:15,266 --> 00:58:16,756
The real world.

719
00:58:58,342 --> 00:58:59,809
What are you doing here?

720
00:59:00,645 --> 00:59:01,737
My name is-

721
00:59:01,912 --> 00:59:05,211
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?

722
00:59:13,391 --> 00:59:15,825
I'm just trying to understand.

723
00:59:15,993 --> 00:59:18,120
How could you understand?

724
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:21,457
Do you know what it is to be a lover?

725
00:59:23,467 --> 00:59:25,594
To be half of a whole?

726
00:59:26,837 --> 00:59:28,395
No.

727
00:59:29,874 --> 00:59:31,865
I'll tell you a riddle.

728
00:59:33,344 --> 00:59:35,642
You're waiting for a train.

729
00:59:36,681 --> 00:59:39,844
A train that will take you far away.

730
00:59:41,218 --> 00:59:44,187
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

731
00:59:45,222 --> 00:59:47,486
...but you don't know for sure.

732
00:59:47,658 --> 00:59:49,558
But it doesn't matter.

733
00:59:50,528 --> 00:59:53,929
How can it not matter to you
where that train will take you?

734
00:59:54,098 --> 00:59:55,861
Because you'll be together.

735
00:59:56,901 --> 00:59:59,995
How could you bring her here, Dom?
- What is this place?

736
01:00:00,404 --> 01:00:03,567
This is a hotel suite where we
used to spend our anniversary.

737
01:00:03,741 --> 01:00:05,072
What happened here?

738
01:00:06,977 --> 01:00:09,810
You promised!
You promised we'd be together!

739
01:00:10,247 --> 01:00:12,306
Please, I need you to stay here
just for now!

740
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:15,714
You said we'd be together!
You said we'd grow old together!

741
01:00:15,886 --> 01:00:18,354
I'll come back for you. I promise.

742
01:00:36,574 --> 01:00:41,944
Do you think you can just build
a prison of memories to lock her in?

743
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:44,946
Do you really think that
that's gonna contain her?

744
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,112
It's time.

745
01:00:48,352 --> 01:00:50,684
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.

746
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:53,016
- When's the funeral?
- Thursday. In Los Angeles.

747
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:56,455
Robert should accompany the body
no later than Tuesday. We should move.

748
01:00:56,627 --> 01:00:58,094
All right.

749
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:01,722
- Cobb, I'm coming with you.
- I promised Miles. No.

750
01:01:01,899 --> 01:01:05,027
The team needs someone who
understands what you're struggling with.

751
01:01:07,605 --> 01:01:09,766
And it doesn't have to be me...

752
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:13,239
...but then you have to show Arthur
what I just saw.

753
01:01:19,016 --> 01:01:20,711
Get us another seat on the plane.

754
01:01:24,789 --> 01:01:27,815
If I get on this plane
and you don't honor our agreement...

755
01:01:27,992 --> 01:01:31,655
...when we land,
I go to jail for the rest of my life.

756
01:01:32,329 --> 01:01:34,524
Complete the job en route...

757
01:01:34,698 --> 01:01:37,166
...I make one phone call from the plane...

758
01:01:37,334 --> 01:01:40,235
...you have no trouble
getting through Immigration.

759
01:01:53,984 --> 01:01:56,475
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

760
01:01:56,654 --> 01:01:58,212
Thank you.

761
01:02:31,822 --> 01:02:35,121
Excuse me, I think this is yours?
You must have dropped it.

762
01:02:35,292 --> 01:02:37,192
Would you care for a drink?

763
01:02:37,361 --> 01:02:38,658
Oh. Water, please.

764
01:02:38,829 --> 01:02:41,127
Oh, um, same, please.

765
01:02:42,099 --> 01:02:43,396
Um...

766
01:02:44,134 --> 01:02:45,226
Thank you.

767
01:02:45,402 --> 01:02:47,267
You know, I couldn't help but notice...

768
01:02:47,438 --> 01:02:51,033
...but you wouldn't happen to be related
to the Maurice Fischer, would you?

769
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:52,698
Yes, he, um...

770
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:55,635
He was my father.

771
01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:00,107
Well, he was a very inspiring figure.
I'm sorry for your loss.

772
01:03:03,087 --> 01:03:04,748
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

773
01:03:04,922 --> 01:03:06,253
Hey.

774
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:08,284
To your father.

775
01:03:08,893 --> 01:03:11,123
May he rest in peace, huh?

776
01:04:19,597 --> 01:04:21,895
- Couldn't have peed before you went under?
- Sorry.

777
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:24,125
Bit too much free champagne
before takeoff?

778
01:04:24,301 --> 01:04:25,393
Ha, ha, bloody ha.

779
01:04:25,569 --> 01:04:28,538
We know he's gonna be looking for a taxi
in this weather.

780
01:04:40,217 --> 01:04:44,244
- Asshole! Hey, man, why don't you try-?
- Walk away.

781
01:05:00,137 --> 01:05:01,536
Just have him ca- I gotta go.

782
01:05:01,705 --> 01:05:03,832
All right. Taxi. Thank you.

783
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:09,644
All right, Third and Market. Snappy.

784
01:05:10,214 --> 01:05:12,546
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, I thought it was free.

785
01:05:12,716 --> 01:05:14,206
- It's not.
- Maybe we could share.

786
01:05:14,385 --> 01:05:17,218
Maybe not.
Can you pull over and get this-?

787
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:21,521
Great.

788
01:05:26,463 --> 01:05:27,930
Come on.

789
01:05:39,043 --> 01:05:41,671
There's $500 in there.
The wallet's worth more than that.

790
01:05:41,845 --> 01:05:43,540
You might at least
drop me at my stop.

791
01:05:43,714 --> 01:05:44,806
I'm afraid that it doesn't-

792
01:05:54,525 --> 01:05:56,322
- Cover him!
Down! Down now!

793
01:05:56,493 --> 01:05:58,120
What the hell is going on?

794
01:06:01,865 --> 01:06:04,095
This wasn't in the design.

795
01:06:05,035 --> 01:06:06,400
Cobb?

796
01:06:06,637 --> 01:06:07,661
Cobb?

797
01:06:58,589 --> 01:06:59,783
Get him!

798
01:07:06,463 --> 01:07:07,896
Are you all right?

799
01:07:08,098 --> 01:07:10,259
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

800
01:07:10,434 --> 01:07:12,334
Fischer's okay, unless he gets carsick.

801
01:07:12,503 --> 01:07:13,731
Saito?

802
01:07:32,656 --> 01:07:34,783
Get Fischer in the back room now.

803
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:37,788
- Get him in the back room. Move.
What the hell happened?

804
01:07:38,228 --> 01:07:39,695
Has he been shot? Is he dying?

805
01:07:39,863 --> 01:07:41,592
I don't know.
- Jesus Christ.

806
01:07:41,765 --> 01:07:44,199
What happened to you?
- Blocked by a freight train.

807
01:07:44,368 --> 01:07:46,336
Why put a train
in a downtown intersection?

808
01:07:46,503 --> 01:07:48,095
- I didn't.
Where'd it come from?

809
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:49,933
Why the hell were we ambushed?

810
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:53,508
Those were not normal projections.
They'd been trained, for God's sakes.

811
01:07:53,677 --> 01:07:56,237
- How could he be trained?
- Fischer's had an extractor...

812
01:07:56,413 --> 01:08:00,611
...teach his subconscious to defend itself,
so his subconscious is militarized.

813
01:08:00,784 --> 01:08:02,411
It should've shown in the research.

814
01:08:02,586 --> 01:08:04,383
Why the hell didn't it?
- Calm down.

815
01:08:04,555 --> 01:08:05,886
Don't tell me to calm down!

816
01:08:06,056 --> 01:08:08,991
This was your job, goddamn it!
This was your responsibility!

817
01:08:09,159 --> 01:08:11,218
You were meant to check
Fischer's background!

818
01:08:11,395 --> 01:08:14,728
- We are not prepared for this!
- We have dealt with sub-security before!

819
01:08:14,898 --> 01:08:16,991
We'll be more careful
and we're gonna be fine!

820
01:08:17,167 --> 01:08:18,964
This was not a part of the plan!
He's dying.

821
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:20,194
Put him out his misery.

822
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:23,203
- No, don't do that! Don't do that.
- Cobb, hey, hey.

823
01:08:23,373 --> 01:08:25,466
He's in agony. I'm waking him up.

824
01:08:25,642 --> 01:08:27,542
No. It won't wake him up.

825
01:08:27,711 --> 01:08:31,306
What do you mean, it won't wake him up?
When we die in a dream, we wake up.

826
01:08:31,481 --> 01:08:32,743
Not from this.

827
01:08:32,916 --> 01:08:35,441
We're too heavily sedated
to wake up that way.

828
01:08:36,053 --> 01:08:37,748
Right. So, what happens when we die?

829
01:08:37,921 --> 01:08:39,752
- We drop into limbo.
- Are you serious?

830
01:08:39,923 --> 01:08:42,448
- Limbo?
Unconstructed dream space.

831
01:08:42,626 --> 01:08:45,891
Well, what the hell is down there?
- Just raw, infinite subconscious.

832
01:08:46,063 --> 01:08:49,260
Nothing is down there, except for
what might have been left behind...

833
01:08:49,433 --> 01:08:52,334
...by anyone sharing the dream
who's been trapped there before.

834
01:08:52,502 --> 01:08:54,402
Which, in our case, is just you.

835
01:08:54,571 --> 01:08:57,267
- How long could we be stuck?
Can't even think about...

836
01:08:57,441 --> 01:08:59,841
...trying to escape until the sedation-
- How long?

837
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:03,241
Decades. It could be infinite.
Ask him, he's the one who's been there.

838
01:09:03,413 --> 01:09:04,607
Let's get him upstairs.

839
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:07,683
Great.

840
01:09:08,685 --> 01:09:10,152
Thank you.

841
01:09:10,854 --> 01:09:14,085
So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind,
battling his own private army.

842
01:09:14,258 --> 01:09:15,725
And if we get killed...

843
01:09:15,893 --> 01:09:19,124
...we'll be lost in limbo till our brains
turn to scrambled egg, hmm?

844
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:27,867
Someone got first aid?

845
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:33,598
- You knew these risks and didn't tell us?
- There weren't meant to be risks.

846
01:09:33,777 --> 01:09:36,712
- I didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire.
- You had no right.

847
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,212
This was the only way
to go three layers deep.

848
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:41,408
You knew about this
and went along with it?

849
01:09:41,585 --> 01:09:42,609
I trusted him.

850
01:09:42,786 --> 01:09:44,686
When? When he promised you
half his share?

851
01:09:44,855 --> 01:09:48,120
No. His whole share.
Besides, he said he'd done it before.

852
01:09:48,292 --> 01:09:50,351
What, with Mal?
Because that worked so good?

853
01:09:50,527 --> 01:09:53,963
That has nothing to do with it.
I did what I had to to get to my children.

854
01:09:54,131 --> 01:09:56,031
You led us into a war zone
with no way out?

855
01:09:56,199 --> 01:10:00,226
There is a way out. We continue on with
the job, and we do it as fast as possible...

856
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:02,736
...and we get out using the kick,
just like before.

857
01:10:02,906 --> 01:10:05,374
Forget it. We go any deeper,
we just raise the stakes.

858
01:10:05,542 --> 01:10:07,407
I am sitting this one out on this level.

859
01:10:07,577 --> 01:10:10,011
Fischer's security
is surrounding this place.

860
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:12,444
Ten hours of flight time
is a week at this level.

861
01:10:12,616 --> 01:10:16,347
That means each and every one of us
will be killed. That I can guarantee you.

862
01:10:16,954 --> 01:10:20,720
We have no other choice but to continue on
and do it as fast as possible.

863
01:10:22,326 --> 01:10:24,760
Downwards is the only way forwards.

864
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:27,456
Get ready.

865
01:10:27,631 --> 01:10:29,826
You, come on. Let's go shake him up.

866
01:10:34,671 --> 01:10:37,697
I'm insured against kidnapping
for up to 10 million.

867
01:10:37,874 --> 01:10:40,809
- This should be very simple.
Shut up! It won't be.

868
01:10:40,978 --> 01:10:43,242
In your father's office,
below the bookshelves...

869
01:10:43,413 --> 01:10:45,472
...is his personal safe.
We need the combination.

870
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:48,249
I don't know any safe.

871
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:51,319
That doesn't mean
you don't know the combination.

872
01:10:52,956 --> 01:10:54,287
Tell us what it is.

873
01:10:55,158 --> 01:10:56,887
I don't know.

874
01:11:01,832 --> 01:11:03,959
We have it on good authority
you do know.

875
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:06,466
Yeah? Whose authority?

876
01:11:07,971 --> 01:11:11,463
- Five hundred dollars, this cost.
What's inside it?

877
01:11:11,742 --> 01:11:15,508
Cash, cards, ID. And this.

878
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:22,040
Useful?

879
01:11:22,786 --> 01:11:23,810
Maybe.

880
01:11:24,287 --> 01:11:26,084
You're on. You've got an hour.

881
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:27,514
An hour?

882
01:11:28,825 --> 01:11:31,089
I was supposed to have all night
to crack this.

883
01:11:31,261 --> 01:11:33,855
And Saito wasn't supposed
to be shot in the chest.

884
01:11:34,031 --> 01:11:37,194
You've got one hour,
now get us something useful, please.

885
01:11:39,736 --> 01:11:42,170
- What's that?
- Good authority.

886
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:48,105
Uncle Peter.

887
01:11:48,812 --> 01:11:50,939
Just make them stop.

888
01:11:51,248 --> 01:11:53,580
- The combination.
- I don't know it.

889
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:56,412
- Why does Browning say you do?
- I don't know.

890
01:11:56,586 --> 01:11:59,054
Just let me talk to him
and I'll find out.

891
01:12:01,425 --> 01:12:04,121
You have one hour. Start talking.

892
01:12:06,129 --> 01:12:07,323
You all right?

893
01:12:09,232 --> 01:12:10,529
You okay?

894
01:12:14,237 --> 01:12:17,900
Those bastards have had at me
for two days.

895
01:12:18,575 --> 01:12:21,043
They have someone with access
to your father's office.

896
01:12:21,211 --> 01:12:23,076
- They're trying to open his safe.
- Yeah.

897
01:12:23,246 --> 01:12:25,976
They thought I'd know the combination,
but I don't know it.

898
01:12:26,149 --> 01:12:28,879
- Yeah, well, neither do I, so...
- What?

899
01:12:29,653 --> 01:12:32,884
Maurice told me that when he passed,
you were the only one able to open it.

900
01:12:33,056 --> 01:12:35,581
No, he never gave me any combination.

901
01:12:36,326 --> 01:12:40,456
Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you
just didn't know it was a combination.

902
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:41,824
Well, what, then?

903
01:12:41,998 --> 01:12:44,523
I don't know, some meaningful
combination of numbers...

904
01:12:44,701 --> 01:12:48,637
...based on your experiences
with Maurice.

905
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:54,276
We didn't have very many, uh,
meaningful experiences together.

906
01:12:55,011 --> 01:12:56,478
Perhaps after your mother died.

907
01:12:59,149 --> 01:13:01,276
After my mother died,
you know what he told me?

908
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:08,720
"Robert,
there's really nothing to be said."

909
01:13:08,898 --> 01:13:11,230
Oh, well, he was bad with emotion.

910
01:13:11,401 --> 01:13:14,097
I was 11, Uncle Peter.

911
01:13:14,871 --> 01:13:18,102
- How's he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain.

912
01:13:18,274 --> 01:13:21,869
When we get down to the lower levels,
the pain will be less intense.

913
01:13:22,045 --> 01:13:23,273
And if he dies?

914
01:13:24,447 --> 01:13:25,914
Worst-case scenario?

915
01:13:26,082 --> 01:13:28,778
When he wakes up,
his mind is completely gone.

916
01:13:28,952 --> 01:13:33,013
Cobb, I'll still honor the arrangement.

917
01:13:33,189 --> 01:13:34,884
I appreciate that, Saito.

918
01:13:35,058 --> 01:13:39,119
But when you wake up, you won't even
remember that we had an arrangement.

919
01:13:39,295 --> 01:13:41,320
Limbo is gonna become your reality.

920
01:13:41,498 --> 01:13:45,264
You're gonna be lost down there so long
that you're gonna become an old man.

921
01:13:45,735 --> 01:13:47,066
Filled with regret?

922
01:13:48,505 --> 01:13:49,597
Waiting to die alone.

923
01:13:50,273 --> 01:13:51,365
No.

924
01:13:51,941 --> 01:13:53,568
I'll come back.

925
01:13:54,377 --> 01:13:57,039
And we'll be young men together again.

926
01:14:03,019 --> 01:14:04,077
Breathe.

927
01:14:04,254 --> 01:14:07,280
These people are gonna kill us
if we don't give them the combination.

928
01:14:07,457 --> 01:14:09,357
- They just wanna ransom us.
- I heard them.

929
01:14:09,526 --> 01:14:13,428
They're gonna lock us in that van,
and then drive it into the river.

930
01:14:13,596 --> 01:14:15,063
All right. What is in the safe?

931
01:14:16,166 --> 01:14:17,326
Something for you.

932
01:14:17,967 --> 01:14:22,097
Maurice always said
it was his most precious gift to you.

933
01:14:22,839 --> 01:14:25,899
- A will.
- Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.

934
01:14:26,076 --> 01:14:27,304
That's an alternate.

935
01:14:27,477 --> 01:14:29,843
This would supersede the other
if you want it to.

936
01:14:30,013 --> 01:14:32,641
It splits up the component businesses
of Fischer Morrow.

937
01:14:32,816 --> 01:14:36,513
It'd be the end of the entire empire
as we know it.

938
01:14:36,686 --> 01:14:39,154
Destroying my whole inheritance?

939
01:14:40,824 --> 01:14:43,987
- Why would he suggest such a thing?
- I just don't know.

940
01:14:46,863 --> 01:14:48,831
He loved you, Robert.

941
01:14:49,399 --> 01:14:51,026
In his own way.

942
01:14:51,201 --> 01:14:52,998
In his own way.

943
01:14:54,304 --> 01:14:55,828
At the end...

944
01:14:56,973 --> 01:14:59,305
...he called me in to his deathbed.

945
01:14:59,809 --> 01:15:01,640
He could barely speak.

946
01:15:02,712 --> 01:15:06,944
But he took the trouble
to tell me one last thing.

947
01:15:09,452 --> 01:15:11,079
He pulled me close.

948
01:15:13,757 --> 01:15:15,850
And I could only make out...

949
01:15:16,726 --> 01:15:18,159
...one word.

950
01:15:21,865 --> 01:15:23,833
"Disappointed."

951
01:15:29,472 --> 01:15:30,666
When were you in limbo?

952
01:15:32,242 --> 01:15:35,734
You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job.

953
01:15:35,912 --> 01:15:38,278
- But they don't know the truth.
- Truth? What truth?

954
01:15:38,481 --> 01:15:42,611
The truth that, at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall.

955
01:15:42,786 --> 01:15:46,847
The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.

956
01:15:47,023 --> 01:15:49,423
And the truth that,
as we go deeper into Fischer...

957
01:15:49,592 --> 01:15:51,389
...we're also going deeper into you.

958
01:15:52,228 --> 01:15:55,493
And I'm not sure
we're gonna like what we find.

959
01:15:59,502 --> 01:16:00,969
We were working together.

960
01:16:01,137 --> 01:16:04,800
We were exploring the concept
of a dream within a dream.

961
01:16:05,008 --> 01:16:06,270
I kept pushing things.

962
01:16:06,442 --> 01:16:10,105
I wanted to go deeper and deeper.
I wanted to go further.

963
01:16:10,613 --> 01:16:15,482
I just didn't understand the concept that
hours could turn into years down there...

964
01:16:15,652 --> 01:16:18,382
...that we could get trapped so deep...

965
01:16:19,222 --> 01:16:22,521
...that when we wound up on the shore
of our own subconscious...

966
01:16:23,126 --> 01:16:25,651
...we lost sight of what was real.

967
01:16:31,734 --> 01:16:34,294
We created.
We built the world for ourselves.

968
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:37,930
We did that for years.

969
01:16:39,075 --> 01:16:41,043
We built our own world.

970
01:16:42,412 --> 01:16:44,107
How long were you stuck there?

971
01:16:45,281 --> 01:16:47,374
Something like 50 years.

972
01:16:50,787 --> 01:16:51,947
Jesus.

973
01:16:54,257 --> 01:16:55,588
How could you stand it?

974
01:16:55,758 --> 01:16:58,488
It wasn't so bad at first,
feeling like gods.

975
01:16:58,661 --> 01:17:01,687
The problem was knowing
that none of it was real.

976
01:17:01,865 --> 01:17:06,268
Eventually, it just became impossible
for me to live like that.

977
01:17:06,436 --> 01:17:07,835
And what about for her?

978
01:17:11,307 --> 01:17:15,209
She had locked something away,
something deep inside her.

979
01:17:16,613 --> 01:17:21,846
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

980
01:17:24,787 --> 01:17:27,278
Limbo became her reality.

981
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:30,422
What happened when you woke up?

982
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:34,623
Well, to wake up from that
after years, after decades...

983
01:17:35,698 --> 01:17:40,192
...to become old souls thrown back
into youth like that?

984
01:17:41,104 --> 01:17:44,870
I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.

985
01:17:46,242 --> 01:17:48,506
Eventually, she told me the truth.

986
01:17:48,945 --> 01:17:52,312
She was possessed by an idea.

987
01:17:52,482 --> 01:17:58,182
This one very simple idea
that changed everything.

988
01:17:59,322 --> 01:18:01,790
That our world wasn't real.

989
01:18:02,725 --> 01:18:06,991
That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality...

990
01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:09,896
...that in order to get back home...

991
01:18:11,134 --> 01:18:12,931
...we had to kill ourselves.

992
01:18:19,575 --> 01:18:23,033
- What about your children?
- She thought they were projections...

993
01:18:23,212 --> 01:18:26,204
...that our real children were waiting
for us up there somewhere.

994
01:18:26,382 --> 01:18:28,077
I'm their mother!
Calm down.

995
01:18:28,251 --> 01:18:29,513
I can tell the difference.

996
01:18:29,686 --> 01:18:32,018
If this is my dream,
why can't I control this?

997
01:18:32,188 --> 01:18:33,883
You don't know you're dreaming!

998
01:18:34,057 --> 01:18:36,252
She was certain
there was nothing I could do...

999
01:18:36,426 --> 01:18:40,260
...no matter how much I begged,
no matter how much I pleaded.

1000
01:18:43,232 --> 01:18:46,258
She wanted to do it,
but she could not do it alone.

1001
01:18:46,436 --> 01:18:52,932
She loved me too much, so she came up
with a plan on our anniversary.

1002
01:19:19,002 --> 01:19:21,800
- Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me.

1003
01:19:21,971 --> 01:19:26,237
Just- Just step back inside. All right?
Just step back inside now, come on.

1004
01:19:26,409 --> 01:19:30,846
No. I'm going to jump,
and you're coming with me.

1005
01:19:31,014 --> 01:19:32,709
No, I'm not.

1006
01:19:32,882 --> 01:19:34,975
Now, you listen to me.

1007
01:19:35,585 --> 01:19:39,817
If you jump, you're not gonna wake up,
remember? You're gonna die.

1008
01:19:39,989 --> 01:19:41,923
Now, just step back inside.

1009
01:19:42,091 --> 01:19:44,821
Come on. Step back inside
so we can talk about this.

1010
01:19:44,994 --> 01:19:46,928
We've talked enough.

1011
01:19:48,998 --> 01:19:50,659
- Mal.
- Come out onto the ledge...

1012
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:53,529
...or I'll jump right now.
- Okay.

1013
01:19:57,807 --> 01:19:59,604
We're gonna talk about this.

1014
01:20:00,476 --> 01:20:01,636
All right?

1015
01:20:01,811 --> 01:20:06,874
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey.

1016
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:10,842
No, I can't. You know I can't do that.

1017
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:13,784
Take a second, think about our children.

1018
01:20:13,956 --> 01:20:15,685
Think about James.

1019
01:20:16,426 --> 01:20:18,053
Think about Phillipa, now.

1020
01:20:18,227 --> 01:20:21,162
If I go without you,
they'll take them away anyway.

1021
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:24,629
- What does that mean?
- I filed a letter with our attorney...

1022
01:20:25,068 --> 01:20:28,401
...explaining how I'm fearful
for my safety.

1023
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:32,767
How you've threatened to kill me.

1024
01:20:35,578 --> 01:20:38,206
- Why did you do this?
- I love you, Dom.

1025
01:20:38,381 --> 01:20:40,144
Why did-? Why would you do this to me?

1026
01:20:40,316 --> 01:20:43,183
I've freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.

1027
01:20:43,352 --> 01:20:46,378
We're going home to our real children.

1028
01:20:46,556 --> 01:20:50,185
Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me,
all right? Mal, look at me, please?

1029
01:20:50,359 --> 01:20:51,656
You're waiting for a train.

1030
01:20:52,161 --> 01:20:55,722
- Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
- A train that will take you far away.

1031
01:20:55,898 --> 01:20:57,889
James and Phillipa are waiting for you!

1032
01:20:58,067 --> 01:21:01,901
You know where you hope this train
will take you, but you can't know for sure.

1033
01:21:02,071 --> 01:21:04,266
- Mal, look at me!
- But it doesn't matter.

1034
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:07,637
- Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!
- Because you'll be together.

1035
01:21:07,810 --> 01:21:11,644
Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!

1036
01:21:11,814 --> 01:21:13,247
Jesus Christ!

1037
01:21:16,752 --> 01:21:20,483
She had herself declared sane
by three different psychiatrists.

1038
01:21:20,656 --> 01:21:24,854
It made it impossible for me to try
to explain the nature of her madness.

1039
01:21:25,027 --> 01:21:26,255
So I ran.

1040
01:21:28,097 --> 01:21:30,327
Right now, or never, Cobb.

1041
01:21:36,706 --> 01:21:41,336
James! Phillipa! Come on in! Come on!

1042
01:21:41,611 --> 01:21:42,669
All right, let's go.

1043
01:21:43,212 --> 01:21:47,012
I left my children behind and I've been
trying to buy my way back ever since.

1044
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:51,451
Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.

1045
01:21:51,621 --> 01:21:54,920
But you are not responsible
for the idea that destroyed her.

1046
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:58,719
And if we are gonna succeed in this...

1047
01:21:58,895 --> 01:22:03,855
...you have to forgive yourself,
and you're gonna have to confront her.

1048
01:22:04,033 --> 01:22:05,864
But you don't have to do that alone.

1049
01:22:06,035 --> 01:22:08,299
- No, you're not...
- I'm doing it for the others.

1050
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:14,068
Because they have no idea the risk
they've taken coming down here with you.

1051
01:22:19,148 --> 01:22:20,638
We have to move.

1052
01:22:20,816 --> 01:22:22,249
Time's up.

1053
01:22:22,418 --> 01:22:25,148
All right. I don't know any combination.

1054
01:22:25,321 --> 01:22:28,415
- Not consciously, anyway.
How about instinctively, huh?

1055
01:22:28,591 --> 01:22:32,527
I got somebody in your father's office
right now ready to tap in the combination.

1056
01:22:32,695 --> 01:22:35,596
Give me the first six numbers
that come to your head right now.

1057
01:22:35,765 --> 01:22:37,995
- I have no idea.
- Right now!

1058
01:22:38,167 --> 01:22:40,397
I said, right now! Right now!

1059
01:22:40,570 --> 01:22:44,472
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.

1060
01:22:48,344 --> 01:22:50,335
You'll have to do better than that.

1061
01:22:50,513 --> 01:22:53,846
All right. Bag them.
You're going for a ride.

1062
01:22:58,221 --> 01:23:02,351
We're worth more to you alive.
You hear me?

1063
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:09,120
What'd you get?

1064
01:23:09,532 --> 01:23:12,057
Relationship with his father
is worse than we imagined.

1065
01:23:12,235 --> 01:23:13,259
This helps us how?

1066
01:23:13,436 --> 01:23:16,530
The stronger the issues,
the more powerful the catharsis.

1067
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:20,834
- How are we gonna reconcile them?
- I'm working on that.

1068
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:24,537
Work faster.
The projections are closing in quick.

1069
01:23:24,714 --> 01:23:28,275
We gotta break out of here
before we're totally boxed in.

1070
01:24:03,386 --> 01:24:04,410
Damn it.

1071
01:24:04,587 --> 01:24:07,579
You mustn't be afraid to dream
a little bigger, darling.

1072
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:27,332
We need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather.

1073
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:31,537
- Destroy his one positive relationship?
- No, repair his relationship with his father...

1074
01:24:31,714 --> 01:24:34,012
...whilst exposing his godfather's
true nature.

1075
01:24:34,183 --> 01:24:37,175
We should charge Fischer a lot more
than Saito for this job.

1076
01:24:37,353 --> 01:24:39,719
His security is gonna
get worse as we go deeper.

1077
01:24:39,889 --> 01:24:42,380
- I think we run with Mr. Charles.
- No.

1078
01:24:42,792 --> 01:24:44,225
Who's Mr. Charles?
- Bad idea.

1079
01:24:44,393 --> 01:24:47,920
The second we get into that hotel
his security's gonna be all over us.

1080
01:24:48,097 --> 01:24:50,190
We run with Mr. Charles
like on the Stein job.

1081
01:24:50,366 --> 01:24:52,698
- You've done it before?
Yeah, and it didn't work.

1082
01:24:52,868 --> 01:24:56,360
The subject realized he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to pieces.

1083
01:24:56,539 --> 01:24:58,564
Excellent. But you learned a lot, right?

1084
01:24:58,741 --> 01:25:00,834
- I need some kind of distraction.
No problem.

1085
01:25:01,010 --> 01:25:03,205
How about a lovely lady
that I've used before?

1086
01:25:03,379 --> 01:25:05,438
Listen to me.
You drive carefully, all right?

1087
01:25:05,614 --> 01:25:08,082
Everything down there is
gonna be unstable as hell.

1088
01:25:12,621 --> 01:25:15,988
Don't jump too soon. We only got
one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.

1089
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:19,457
I'll play the music to let you know
it's coming. The rest is on you.

1090
01:25:19,628 --> 01:25:21,425
- You ready?
- Ready!

1091
01:25:22,665 --> 01:25:23,757
Sweet dreams.

1092
01:25:23,933 --> 01:25:25,833
Am I boring you?

1093
01:25:27,136 --> 01:25:30,333
I was telling you my story.
I guess it wasn't to your liking.

1094
01:25:32,174 --> 01:25:34,836
Um, I have a lot on my mind.

1095
01:25:36,379 --> 01:25:37,971
There goes Mr. Charles.

1096
01:25:42,685 --> 01:25:45,313
Mr. Fischer, right?

1097
01:25:45,488 --> 01:25:48,980
Pleasure to see you again.
Rod Green from marketing. L-

1098
01:25:49,158 --> 01:25:50,284
Hmm.

1099
01:25:50,459 --> 01:25:53,121
- And you must be?
- Leaving.

1100
01:25:56,365 --> 01:25:57,491
In case you get bored.

1101
01:26:02,738 --> 01:26:04,103
Must've blown you off.

1102
01:26:04,273 --> 01:26:07,003
That is, unless her phone number
really is only six digits.

1103
01:26:09,178 --> 01:26:13,615
Funny way to make friends,
someone stealing your wallet like that.

1104
01:26:17,553 --> 01:26:19,885
Goddamn it. The wallet alone
is worth at least 500-

1105
01:26:20,055 --> 01:26:21,181
About $500, right?

1106
01:26:21,357 --> 01:26:24,326
Don't worry about it.
My people are already on it as we speak.

1107
01:26:24,493 --> 01:26:26,427
Who or what is Mr. Charles?

1108
01:26:26,629 --> 01:26:30,326
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer
against his own subconscious.

1109
01:26:30,499 --> 01:26:31,830
And why don't you approve?

1110
01:26:32,001 --> 01:26:33,992
It involves telling the mark
that he's dreaming...

1111
01:26:34,170 --> 01:26:36,297
...which involves attracting
a lot of attention to us.

1112
01:26:36,472 --> 01:26:39,407
- Didn't Cobb say never to do that?
- Hmm.

1113
01:26:39,575 --> 01:26:41,338
So now you've noticed how much time...

1114
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:44,138
...Cobb spends doing things
he says never to do.

1115
01:26:45,881 --> 01:26:47,644
Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?

1116
01:26:47,817 --> 01:26:50,251
- I'm sorry, but...
Hold on! Wait!

1117
01:26:51,587 --> 01:26:52,884
You look a bit perkier.

1118
01:26:53,055 --> 01:26:55,387
Very amusing, Mr. Eames.

1119
01:27:01,630 --> 01:27:03,120
Turbulence on the plane?

1120
01:27:03,299 --> 01:27:04,994
No, it's much closer.

1121
01:27:05,167 --> 01:27:06,828
That's Yusuf's driving.

1122
01:27:15,177 --> 01:27:17,645
Um, I'm sorry.
Who did you say you were?

1123
01:27:17,813 --> 01:27:19,906
Rod Green from marketing.

1124
01:27:20,082 --> 01:27:21,674
But that's not true at all, is it?

1125
01:27:23,786 --> 01:27:27,244
My name is Mr. Charles.
You remember me, don't you?

1126
01:27:27,456 --> 01:27:29,424
I'm the head of your security down here.

1127
01:27:30,693 --> 01:27:32,627
Get out on a different floor,
keep moving.

1128
01:27:32,795 --> 01:27:35,127
Dump the wallet.
Security will be looking for that.

1129
01:27:35,297 --> 01:27:38,789
- Okay.
- We need to buy Cobb a little more time.

1130
01:27:42,438 --> 01:27:43,996
Security, huh?

1131
01:27:46,442 --> 01:27:48,603
- You work for the hotel?
- No, no.

1132
01:27:48,777 --> 01:27:53,373
I specialize in a very specific type
of security.

1133
01:27:53,782 --> 01:27:55,443
Subconscious security.

1134
01:27:55,618 --> 01:27:57,711
You're talking about dreams?

1135
01:27:57,887 --> 01:28:00,754
Are you talking about, um, extraction?

1136
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:03,189
I am here to protect you.

1137
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:19,164
Mr. Fischer, I'm here
to protect you in the event...

1138
01:28:19,341 --> 01:28:22,708
...that someone tries to access
your mind through your dreams.

1139
01:28:22,878 --> 01:28:25,506
You're not safe here.

1140
01:28:26,348 --> 01:28:27,940
They're coming for you.

1141
01:28:46,302 --> 01:28:48,327
Strange weather, isn't it?

1142
01:28:53,175 --> 01:28:54,301
You feel that?

1143
01:28:56,278 --> 01:28:57,472
What's happening?

1144
01:28:57,646 --> 01:29:00,877
Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
to the strangeness of the dream...

1145
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:03,917
...which is making his subconscious
look for the dreamer.

1146
01:29:04,086 --> 01:29:07,146
For me. Quick, give me a kiss.

1147
01:29:12,161 --> 01:29:16,029
- They're still looking at us.
- Yeah, it was worth a shot.

1148
01:29:16,699 --> 01:29:18,724
We should probably get out of here.

1149
01:29:34,016 --> 01:29:37,577
You feel that? You've actually
been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.

1150
01:29:37,753 --> 01:29:41,746
Pay attention to the strangeness
of the weather, the shift in gravity.

1151
01:29:41,924 --> 01:29:45,087
None of this is real. You're in a dream.

1152
01:29:49,898 --> 01:29:52,128
Now, the easiest way
for you to test yourself...

1153
01:29:52,334 --> 01:29:56,395
...is to try and remember how you arrived
at this hotel. Can you do that?

1154
01:29:57,239 --> 01:29:58,536
Yeah, I...

1155
01:29:58,707 --> 01:30:01,232
No, breathe, breathe.
Remember your training.

1156
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:06,575
Accept the fact that you're in a dream,
and I'm here to protect you. Go on.

1157
01:30:08,584 --> 01:30:09,949
Mm-hm.

1158
01:30:12,755 --> 01:30:14,586
- You're not real?
- No.

1159
01:30:14,757 --> 01:30:18,124
No. I'm a projection
of your subconscious.

1160
01:30:18,293 --> 01:30:20,386
I was sent here to protect you
in the event...

1161
01:30:20,562 --> 01:30:23,463
...that extractors
tried to pull you into a dream.

1162
01:30:23,632 --> 01:30:26,863
And I believe that's what's
going on right now, Mr. Fischer.

1163
01:30:27,970 --> 01:30:28,994
Yeah.

1164
01:30:29,171 --> 01:30:30,263
Okay.

1165
01:30:31,173 --> 01:30:32,401
Okay.

1166
01:30:35,244 --> 01:30:37,235
Can you get me out of here?

1167
01:30:38,147 --> 01:30:40,741
Right away. Follow me.

1168
01:30:54,963 --> 01:30:56,294
Hold on a second.

1169
01:31:01,236 --> 01:31:03,067
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?

1170
01:31:03,238 --> 01:31:05,502
These men were sent here
to abduct you, all right?

1171
01:31:05,674 --> 01:31:08,234
If you want my help,
you have to remain calm.

1172
01:31:09,978 --> 01:31:12,276
I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.

1173
01:31:23,992 --> 01:31:27,587
If this is a dream, I should just
kill myself to wake up, right?

1174
01:31:27,763 --> 01:31:29,856
I wouldn't do that if I were you,
Mr. Fischer.

1175
01:31:30,032 --> 01:31:33,524
I believe they have you sedated,
and if you pull that trigger...

1176
01:31:33,702 --> 01:31:34,862
...you may not wake up.

1177
01:31:36,004 --> 01:31:40,304
You may go into a further dream state.
Now, you know what I'm talking about.

1178
01:31:42,644 --> 01:31:44,305
You remember the training.

1179
01:31:45,447 --> 01:31:46,846
Remember what I said to you.

1180
01:31:47,716 --> 01:31:48,876
Give me the gun.

1181
01:32:00,696 --> 01:32:03,290
- This room should be directly below 528?
- Yeah.

1182
01:32:12,674 --> 01:32:14,164
Think, Mr. Fischer, think.

1183
01:32:14,343 --> 01:32:18,177
What do you remember
from before this dream?

1184
01:32:18,547 --> 01:32:21,175
There was, um, a lot of gunfire.

1185
01:32:21,350 --> 01:32:23,944
There was rain.

1186
01:32:24,486 --> 01:32:26,078
Uncle Peter.

1187
01:32:26,355 --> 01:32:29,984
- Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped.
- Where were they holding you?

1188
01:32:33,028 --> 01:32:36,293
- They had us in the back of a van.
- That explains the gravity shifts.

1189
01:32:36,498 --> 01:32:38,557
You're in the back of a van.
Keep going.

1190
01:32:38,734 --> 01:32:40,998
It had something to do with, um...

1191
01:32:41,637 --> 01:32:44,504
Something to do with a safe.

1192
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:46,767
God, why is it so hard to remember?

1193
01:32:46,942 --> 01:32:49,638
It's like trying to remember a dream
after you've woken up.

1194
01:32:49,812 --> 01:32:51,541
Listen, it takes years of practice.

1195
01:32:51,713 --> 01:32:54,113
You and Browning have been pulled
into this dream...

1196
01:32:54,283 --> 01:32:57,047
...because they're trying to steal
something from your mind.

1197
01:32:57,219 --> 01:33:00,780
I need you to focus and try
and remember what that is.

1198
01:33:00,956 --> 01:33:02,583
What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!

1199
01:33:02,758 --> 01:33:06,489
A combination. They demanded
the first numbers to pop into my head.

1200
01:33:06,662 --> 01:33:09,392
They're trying to extract a number
from your subconscious.

1201
01:33:09,565 --> 01:33:13,331
It can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.

1202
01:33:14,136 --> 01:33:17,264
We should try hotel rooms.
What was the number, Mr. Fischer?

1203
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:20,272
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.

1204
01:33:20,442 --> 01:33:21,773
Five.

1205
01:33:22,744 --> 01:33:25,178
Five, two- It was something,
it was a long number.

1206
01:33:25,347 --> 01:33:27,440
That's good. We can start there.
Fifth floor.

1207
01:33:27,616 --> 01:33:28,640
Yep.

1208
01:33:28,817 --> 01:33:32,844
- So do you use a timer?
- No, I have to judge it for myself.

1209
01:33:33,055 --> 01:33:36,320
While you're all asleep in 528,
I wait for Yusuf's kick.

1210
01:33:36,491 --> 01:33:38,618
- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.

1211
01:33:38,794 --> 01:33:42,730
And then when the van hits the barrier
of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.

1212
01:33:42,898 --> 01:33:46,095
So we get a nice synchronized kick.

1213
01:33:46,268 --> 01:33:48,668
If it's too soon,
we won't get pulled out.

1214
01:33:48,837 --> 01:33:52,102
But if it's too late,
I won't be able to drop us.

1215
01:33:52,274 --> 01:33:56,074
- Well, why not?
- Because the van will be in freefall.

1216
01:33:56,612 --> 01:33:59,445
- Can't drop you without gravity.
- Right.

1217
01:34:05,087 --> 01:34:07,317
They're with me. Go on.

1218
01:34:31,647 --> 01:34:32,671
Mr. Charles.

1219
01:34:32,848 --> 01:34:35,817
- Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?
- Yeah, I think so.

1220
01:34:35,984 --> 01:34:38,043
They were trying to put you under.

1221
01:34:38,487 --> 01:34:40,546
- I'm already under.
- Under again.

1222
01:34:40,722 --> 01:34:43,282
What do you mean,
a dream within a dream?

1223
01:34:43,892 --> 01:34:46,360
Hey. I see you've changed.

1224
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:48,155
I'm sorry?

1225
01:34:48,664 --> 01:34:52,532
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mistook you for a friend.

1226
01:34:52,701 --> 01:34:53,963
Oh.

1227
01:34:54,136 --> 01:34:56,263
Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.

1228
01:34:56,939 --> 01:34:59,874
No, no, no. That's Fischer's
projection of Browning.

1229
01:35:00,042 --> 01:35:01,907
Let's follow him
and see how he behaves.

1230
01:35:02,077 --> 01:35:04,045
- Why?
- Because how he acts will tell us...

1231
01:35:04,212 --> 01:35:07,545
...if Fischer is starting to suspect
his motives the way we want him to.

1232
01:35:07,716 --> 01:35:08,740
Shh.

1233
01:35:13,322 --> 01:35:15,813
- Uncle Peter.
- You said you were kidnapped together?

1234
01:35:15,991 --> 01:35:19,427
Well, not exactly. They already had him.
They were torturing him.

1235
01:35:19,594 --> 01:35:21,061
And you saw them torture him?

1236
01:35:28,603 --> 01:35:30,434
The kidnappers are working for you?

1237
01:35:31,406 --> 01:35:32,873
Robert.

1238
01:35:33,041 --> 01:35:36,875
You're trying to get that safe open?
To get the alternate will?

1239
01:35:37,279 --> 01:35:41,511
Fischer Morrow has been my entire life.
I can't let you destroy it.

1240
01:35:41,683 --> 01:35:44,049
I'm not gonna throw away
my inheritance.

1241
01:35:44,219 --> 01:35:48,383
I couldn't let you rise
to your father's last taunt.

1242
01:35:49,191 --> 01:35:52,217
- What taunt?
- The will, Robert. That will?

1243
01:35:52,394 --> 01:35:54,328
That's his last insult.

1244
01:35:54,496 --> 01:35:58,125
A challenge for you to build something
for yourself...

1245
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:02,100
...by telling you you're not worthy
of his accomplishments.

1246
01:36:07,776 --> 01:36:13,146
- What, but that he was, um, disappointed?
- I'm sorry.

1247
01:36:14,516 --> 01:36:17,610
But he's wrong.

1248
01:36:18,353 --> 01:36:20,981
You can build a better company
than he ever did.

1249
01:36:21,156 --> 01:36:23,590
Mr. Fischer? He's lying.

1250
01:36:23,759 --> 01:36:25,852
- How do you know?
- Trust me, it's what I do.

1251
01:36:26,028 --> 01:36:28,792
He's hiding something,
and we need to find out what that is.

1252
01:36:29,998 --> 01:36:33,399
I need you to do the same thing to him
that he was going to do to you.

1253
01:36:35,971 --> 01:36:40,032
We'll enter his subconscious and find out
what he doesn't want you to know.

1254
01:36:41,309 --> 01:36:42,776
All right.

1255
01:36:48,750 --> 01:36:50,012
He's out.
- Wait.

1256
01:36:50,185 --> 01:36:52,244
Whose subconscious are
we going into exactly?

1257
01:36:52,421 --> 01:36:53,752
We're going into Fischer's.

1258
01:36:53,922 --> 01:36:56,618
I told him it was Browning's
so he'd be a part of our team.

1259
01:36:56,792 --> 01:36:59,124
He's gonna help us break
into his own subconscious.

1260
01:36:59,294 --> 01:37:00,852
That's right.

1261
01:37:01,029 --> 01:37:03,088
Security's gonna run you down hard.

1262
01:37:03,265 --> 01:37:05,597
And I will lead them on a merry chase.

1263
01:37:06,168 --> 01:37:08,796
- Just be back before the kick.
- Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.

1264
01:37:14,009 --> 01:37:15,203
You good?

1265
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:19,711
Hey. You ready?

1266
01:37:19,881 --> 01:37:23,476
Yes, yes. I'm fine. I'm ready.

1267
01:37:36,031 --> 01:37:37,362
Cobb?

1268
01:37:38,033 --> 01:37:40,467
Cobb? What's down there?

1269
01:37:43,839 --> 01:37:46,433
Hopefully, the truth
we want Fischer to learn.

1270
01:37:46,608 --> 01:37:48,508
I mean, what's down there for you?

1271
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:26,863
Did you see that?

1272
01:40:45,353 --> 01:40:47,184
Eames, this is your dream.

1273
01:40:47,355 --> 01:40:50,449
I need you to draw the security away
from the complex, understand?

1274
01:40:50,625 --> 01:40:52,422
- Who guides Fischer in?
Not me.

1275
01:40:52,594 --> 01:40:55,062
If I know the route,
everything could be compromised.

1276
01:40:55,230 --> 01:40:57,755
- I designed the place.
No, you're with me.

1277
01:40:57,932 --> 01:40:59,456
I could do it.

1278
01:40:59,901 --> 01:41:02,335
All right. Brief him on the route
into the complex.

1279
01:41:02,504 --> 01:41:06,702
- Fischer, you'll be going with him.
- All right. What about you?

1280
01:41:06,875 --> 01:41:09,708
You keep this live.
I'll be listening in the whole time.

1281
01:41:09,878 --> 01:41:14,008
The windows on that upper floor are big
enough for me to cover you from that tower.

1282
01:41:14,182 --> 01:41:15,479
You're not coming in?

1283
01:41:15,650 --> 01:41:17,982
In order to find out the truth
about your father...

1284
01:41:18,153 --> 01:41:21,179
...you're gonna need to break into
Browning's mind on your own.

1285
01:41:22,057 --> 01:41:23,524
Come on, Fischer!

1286
01:42:18,613 --> 01:42:22,276
- Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!
- Go, go, go!

1287
01:42:22,450 --> 01:42:23,974
Move!

1288
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:26,578
Go!

1289
01:42:41,803 --> 01:42:42,827
Sod it.

1290
01:42:54,015 --> 01:42:55,676
I hope you're ready.

1291
01:43:04,426 --> 01:43:06,189
No, it's too soon.

1292
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:13,894
Cobb, do you hear that?

1293
01:43:14,068 --> 01:43:17,629
I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago,
I thought it was the wind up here.

1294
01:43:18,173 --> 01:43:20,664
Yeah, I hear it. It's music.

1295
01:43:20,842 --> 01:43:22,241
So, what do we do?

1296
01:43:22,410 --> 01:43:23,809
We move fast.

1297
01:43:29,317 --> 01:43:31,547
Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.

1298
01:43:33,421 --> 01:43:35,787
Which gives Arthur three minutes.

1299
01:43:36,724 --> 01:43:38,817
- Hey!
- That's him!

1300
01:43:39,494 --> 01:43:41,223
- Which gives us what?
- Sixty minutes.

1301
01:43:41,396 --> 01:43:44,661
- Can they make that route in an hour?
- They have to climb to the terrace.

1302
01:43:44,833 --> 01:43:47,700
Then they need a new route,
a more direct route.

1303
01:43:58,913 --> 01:44:00,540
It's designed as a labyrinth.

1304
01:44:00,715 --> 01:44:03,183
There must be access routes
that cut through the maze.

1305
01:44:03,351 --> 01:44:04,943
Eames?

1306
01:44:28,042 --> 01:44:29,304
Did Eames add any features?

1307
01:44:29,477 --> 01:44:30,944
I don't think I should tell you.

1308
01:44:31,112 --> 01:44:33,410
We don't have time for this.
Did he add anything?

1309
01:44:33,848 --> 01:44:36,612
He added an air-duct system
that can cut through the maze.

1310
01:44:36,784 --> 01:44:37,978
Good. Explain it to them.

1311
01:44:38,152 --> 01:44:39,380
Saito?
- Go ahead.

1312
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:14,278
Paradox.

1313
01:46:24,158 --> 01:46:26,217
What was that?
- The kick.

1314
01:46:26,828 --> 01:46:28,728
Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?

1315
01:46:28,896 --> 01:46:30,591
Yeah, we missed it.

1316
01:46:30,765 --> 01:46:31,959
Man.

1317
01:46:32,133 --> 01:46:36,433
Couldn't someone have dreamt up
a goddamn beach? Huh?

1318
01:46:36,604 --> 01:46:37,866
Uh-huh.

1319
01:46:38,606 --> 01:46:40,767
Well, what the hell do we do now?

1320
01:46:40,942 --> 01:46:42,773
We finish the job before the next kick.

1321
01:46:42,944 --> 01:46:45,037
- What next kick?
- When the van hits the water.

1322
01:47:07,902 --> 01:47:11,338
If you'd like to
make a call, please hang up and try again.

1323
01:47:11,506 --> 01:47:13,337
If you need help, hang up...

1324
01:47:13,574 --> 01:47:16,873
How do I drop you without gravity?

1325
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:22,042
Arthur has a couple minutes,
and we have about 20.

1326
01:47:45,473 --> 01:47:47,134
You okay?

1327
01:47:51,612 --> 01:47:55,480
Run! Turn around!
Move to base! Move to base!

1328
01:47:55,650 --> 01:47:57,174
Go, go, go!

1329
01:47:59,353 --> 01:48:00,513
There's something wrong.

1330
01:48:00,688 --> 01:48:03,020
They're heading your way,
like they know something.

1331
01:48:04,258 --> 01:48:06,488
Just buy us more time, all right?

1332
01:48:06,661 --> 01:48:08,492
- Come on!
- On my way.

1333
01:48:08,663 --> 01:48:10,358
Come on! Move!

1334
01:49:34,549 --> 01:49:36,073
All right.

1335
01:49:48,262 --> 01:49:51,060
Okay. That's the antechamber
outside the strong room.

1336
01:49:51,232 --> 01:49:54,724
- Does the strong room have windows?
- It wouldn't be very strong if it did.

1337
01:49:54,902 --> 01:49:57,132
Let's hope Fischer likes
what he finds in there.

1338
01:49:58,773 --> 01:50:02,106
- Are those projections his subconscious?
- Yes.

1339
01:50:02,276 --> 01:50:05,643
- Are you destroying parts of his mind?
- No. They're just projections.

1340
01:50:31,939 --> 01:50:33,668
- We're here.
- You're clear, but hurry.

1341
01:50:33,841 --> 01:50:35,672
There's an entire army headed your way.

1342
01:51:02,503 --> 01:51:03,868
I'm in.

1343
01:51:09,176 --> 01:51:10,302
There he is.

1344
01:51:52,954 --> 01:51:55,650
- There's someone in there.
- Fischer, it's a trap. Get out.

1345
01:51:56,824 --> 01:51:59,384
Come on. Come on, a little lower.

1346
01:52:05,132 --> 01:52:06,292
Cobb.

1347
01:52:06,934 --> 01:52:09,459
No, she is not real.

1348
01:52:10,071 --> 01:52:11,299
How do you know that?

1349
01:52:11,472 --> 01:52:15,101
She is just a projection.
Fischer. Fischer is real.

1350
01:52:19,113 --> 01:52:20,637
Hello.

1351
01:52:25,319 --> 01:52:28,516
Eames!
Eames, get to the antechamber now!

1352
01:53:12,433 --> 01:53:15,300
What happened?
- Mal killed Fischer.

1353
01:53:17,571 --> 01:53:19,596
I couldn't shoot her.

1354
01:53:20,274 --> 01:53:23,641
There's no use in reviving him.
His mind's already trapped down there.

1355
01:53:23,811 --> 01:53:24,869
It's all over.

1356
01:53:26,614 --> 01:53:28,241
So that's it, then? We failed?

1357
01:53:28,883 --> 01:53:31,044
We're done. I'm sorry.

1358
01:53:34,922 --> 01:53:37,550
It's not me that doesn't get back
to my family, is it?

1359
01:53:38,259 --> 01:53:42,161
Shame. I wanted to know what was
gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.

1360
01:53:42,329 --> 01:53:44,388
Let's set the charges.

1361
01:53:46,233 --> 01:53:47,723
No, there's still another way.

1362
01:53:49,036 --> 01:53:52,437
- We have to follow Fischer down there.
- Not enough time.

1363
01:53:52,606 --> 01:53:55,439
No, but there will be enough time
down there.

1364
01:53:56,577 --> 01:53:57,669
And we will find him.

1365
01:53:57,845 --> 01:54:01,781
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in,
just use the defibrillator to revive him.

1366
01:54:01,949 --> 01:54:04,850
We can give him his own kick
down below.

1367
01:54:05,886 --> 01:54:07,581
Look, you get him in there.

1368
01:54:07,755 --> 01:54:10,622
As soon as the music ends,
you blow up the hospital...

1369
01:54:10,791 --> 01:54:13,589
...and we all ride the kick
back up the layers.

1370
01:54:14,795 --> 01:54:19,562
It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold
the guards off while I set the charges.

1371
01:54:19,733 --> 01:54:21,826
Saito will never make it, will he?

1372
01:54:23,137 --> 01:54:26,334
- Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this.
- Go for it.

1373
01:54:26,507 --> 01:54:29,442
If you are not back before the kick,
I am gone with or without you.

1374
01:54:29,610 --> 01:54:32,841
She's right. She's right.
Come on. Let's go.

1375
01:54:37,084 --> 01:54:39,279
Can I trust you to do
what needs to happen here?

1376
01:54:39,453 --> 01:54:40,647
Mal's gonna be down there.

1377
01:54:40,821 --> 01:54:43,255
I know where to find her.
She'll have Fischer.

1378
01:54:43,424 --> 01:54:47,326
- How do you know?
- Because she wants me to come after him.

1379
01:54:47,495 --> 01:54:49,656
She wants me back down there with her.

1380
01:55:16,423 --> 01:55:17,447
All right?

1381
01:55:24,698 --> 01:55:27,360
- This is your world?
- It was.

1382
01:55:28,169 --> 01:55:30,103
And this is where she'll be.

1383
01:55:30,905 --> 01:55:32,395
Come on.

1384
01:56:18,886 --> 01:56:21,354
Saito. Saito.

1385
01:56:21,789 --> 01:56:25,748
I need you to take care of Fischer
while I go set some charges, okay?

1386
01:56:25,926 --> 01:56:29,362
No room for tourists on these jobs.

1387
01:56:31,999 --> 01:56:33,159
Don't be silly.

1388
01:57:05,666 --> 01:57:07,725
You built all this? This is incredible.

1389
01:57:08,202 --> 01:57:10,227
We built for years.

1390
01:57:11,272 --> 01:57:13,263
Then we started in on the memories.

1391
01:57:20,314 --> 01:57:21,713
This way.

1392
01:58:03,390 --> 01:58:05,483
This was our neighborhood.

1393
01:58:05,659 --> 01:58:07,991
Places from our past.

1394
01:58:08,162 --> 01:58:09,925
That was our first apartment.

1395
01:58:10,097 --> 01:58:12,327
Then we moved to that building
right there.

1396
01:58:12,499 --> 01:58:15,024
After Mal became pregnant,
that became our home.

1397
01:58:15,202 --> 01:58:18,000
You reconstructed all of this
from memory?

1398
01:58:18,172 --> 01:58:20,436
Like I told you, we had lots of time.

1399
01:58:20,607 --> 01:58:22,199
What is that?

1400
01:58:23,744 --> 01:58:25,507
That's the house Mal grew up in.

1401
01:58:25,679 --> 01:58:28,113
- Well, will she be in there?
- No.

1402
01:58:28,449 --> 01:58:29,473
Come on.

1403
01:58:29,650 --> 01:58:32,983
We both wanted to live in a house,
but we loved this type of building.

1404
01:58:33,153 --> 01:58:36,088
In the real world,
we'd have to choose, but not here.

1405
01:59:16,663 --> 01:59:18,688
How are we gonna bring Fischer back?

1406
01:59:19,099 --> 01:59:21,533
We're gonna have to come up
with some kind of a kick.

1407
01:59:21,702 --> 01:59:23,101
What?

1408
01:59:24,104 --> 01:59:25,196
I'm gonna improvise.

1409
01:59:25,372 --> 01:59:30,036
Listen, there's something you should
know about me. About inception.

1410
01:59:43,123 --> 01:59:46,991
An idea is like a virus. Resilient.

1411
01:59:47,828 --> 01:59:49,386
Highly contagious.

1412
01:59:49,563 --> 01:59:52,896
And the smallest seed
of an idea can grow.

1413
01:59:53,967 --> 01:59:55,935
It can grow to define...

1414
01:59:56,970 --> 01:59:58,528
...or destroy you.

1415
02:00:01,675 --> 02:00:04,439
The smallest idea, such as:

1416
02:00:05,045 --> 02:00:07,411
"Your world is not real."

1417
02:00:07,681 --> 02:00:11,447
Simple little thought
that changes everything.

1418
02:00:12,686 --> 02:00:17,180
So certain of your world. Of what's real.

1419
02:00:17,357 --> 02:00:19,154
Do you think he is?

1420
02:00:20,961 --> 02:00:23,862
Or do you think he's as lost as I was?

1421
02:00:24,998 --> 02:00:26,488
I know what's real, Mal.

1422
02:00:28,569 --> 02:00:30,867
No creeping doubts?

1423
02:00:31,572 --> 02:00:34,200
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?

1424
02:00:34,508 --> 02:00:35,839
Chased around the globe...

1425
02:00:36,009 --> 02:00:38,671
...by anonymous corporations
and police forces...

1426
02:00:38,846 --> 02:00:41,474
...the way the projections
persecute the dreamer?

1427
02:00:43,083 --> 02:00:44,573
Admit it.

1428
02:00:45,886 --> 02:00:48,719
You don't believe in one reality anymore.

1429
02:00:48,889 --> 02:00:50,413
So choose.

1430
02:00:50,591 --> 02:00:52,855
Choose to be here.

1431
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:54,850
Choose me.

1432
02:01:20,721 --> 02:01:21,983
You know what I have to do.

1433
02:01:22,155 --> 02:01:24,817
I have to get back to our children
because you left them.

1434
02:01:26,159 --> 02:01:27,683
Because you left us.

1435
02:01:27,861 --> 02:01:29,658
- You're wrong.
I'm not wrong.

1436
02:01:29,830 --> 02:01:31,855
You're confused.

1437
02:01:32,966 --> 02:01:35,025
Our children are here.

1438
02:01:35,802 --> 02:01:39,067
And you'd like to see their faces again,
wouldn't you?

1439
02:01:39,239 --> 02:01:42,299
Yes, but I'm gonna see them
up above, Mal.

1440
02:01:55,956 --> 02:01:57,947
Up above?

1441
02:01:58,859 --> 02:02:02,488
Listen to yourself.
These are our children.

1442
02:02:03,030 --> 02:02:04,395
Watch.

1443
02:02:04,898 --> 02:02:06,593
James? Phillipa?

1444
02:02:06,767 --> 02:02:09,201
Don't do this, Mal. Please.
Those aren't my children.

1445
02:02:09,369 --> 02:02:11,837
You keep telling yourself that,
but you don't believe it.

1446
02:02:12,005 --> 02:02:13,905
- No, I know it.
- What if you're wrong?

1447
02:02:14,308 --> 02:02:16,606
What if I'm what's real?

1448
02:02:17,811 --> 02:02:20,041
You keep telling yourself what you know.

1449
02:02:21,615 --> 02:02:23,845
But what do you believe?

1450
02:02:24,818 --> 02:02:26,046
What do you feel?

1451
02:02:28,188 --> 02:02:29,621
Guilt.

1452
02:02:30,824 --> 02:02:33,054
I feel guilt, Mal.

1453
02:02:33,594 --> 02:02:37,530
And no matter what I do,
no matter how hopeless I am...

1454
02:02:37,698 --> 02:02:41,964
...no matter how confused,
that guilt is always there...

1455
02:02:42,135 --> 02:02:44,660
...reminding me of the truth.

1456
02:02:45,172 --> 02:02:46,469
What truth?

1457
02:02:48,909 --> 02:02:54,142
That the idea that caused you to question
your reality came from me.

1458
02:02:57,517 --> 02:03:00,645
You planted the idea in my mind?

1459
02:03:02,155 --> 02:03:03,645
What is she talking about?

1460
02:03:04,558 --> 02:03:09,825
The reason I knew inception was possible
was because I did it to her first.

1461
02:03:10,864 --> 02:03:13,833
- I did it to my own wife.
- Why?

1462
02:03:14,568 --> 02:03:16,058
We were lost in here.

1463
02:03:17,004 --> 02:03:21,634
I knew we needed to escape,
but she wouldn't accept it.

1464
02:03:24,845 --> 02:03:30,511
She had locked something away,
something deep inside.

1465
02:03:31,284 --> 02:03:35,414
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

1466
02:03:36,390 --> 02:03:38,517
And she couldn't break free.

1467
02:03:41,228 --> 02:03:43,958
So I decided to search for it.

1468
02:03:44,531 --> 02:03:49,400
I went deep into the recess of her mind
and found that secret place.

1469
02:03:49,569 --> 02:03:51,469
And I broke in...

1470
02:03:52,039 --> 02:03:54,200
...and I planted an idea.

1471
02:03:54,941 --> 02:03:58,707
A simple little idea
that would change everything.

1472
02:04:03,950 --> 02:04:06,316
That her world wasn't real.

1473
02:04:19,132 --> 02:04:22,329
That death was the only escape.

1474
02:04:29,743 --> 02:04:31,506
You're waiting for a train.

1475
02:04:33,814 --> 02:04:36,544
A train that'll take you far away.

1476
02:04:37,718 --> 02:04:40,710
You know where you hope
this train will take you...

1477
02:04:41,822 --> 02:04:43,847
...but you can't know for sure.

1478
02:04:45,025 --> 02:04:46,549
Yet it doesn't matter.

1479
02:04:47,994 --> 02:04:51,157
- Now, tell me why!
- Because you'll be together!

1480
02:04:55,502 --> 02:04:59,563
But I never knew that that idea
would grow in her mind like a cancer...

1481
02:04:59,740 --> 02:05:02,140
...that even after she woke...

1482
02:05:05,045 --> 02:05:07,513
That even after
you came back to reality...

1483
02:05:10,450 --> 02:05:13,419
...that you'd continue to believe
your world wasn't real.

1484
02:05:16,189 --> 02:05:18,589
That death was the only escape.

1485
02:05:18,759 --> 02:05:21,421
Mal, no! Jesus!

1486
02:05:21,595 --> 02:05:25,292
- You infected my mind.
- I was trying to save you.

1487
02:05:25,465 --> 02:05:26,864
You betrayed me.

1488
02:05:27,701 --> 02:05:31,398
But you can make amends.
You can still keep your promise.

1489
02:05:31,571 --> 02:05:34,597
We can still be together, right here...

1490
02:05:34,775 --> 02:05:37,243
...in the world we built together.

1491
02:06:58,058 --> 02:07:00,390
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.

1492
02:07:01,261 --> 02:07:02,558
You can't have him.

1493
02:07:03,597 --> 02:07:07,033
- If I stay here, will you let him go?
- What are you talking about?

1494
02:07:11,504 --> 02:07:13,335
Fischer is on the porch.

1495
02:07:13,907 --> 02:07:16,501
- Go check he's alive, Ariadne.
- Cobb, you can't do this.

1496
02:07:16,676 --> 02:07:19,304
Go check he's alive right now. Do it.

1497
02:07:34,961 --> 02:07:38,055
He's here! And it's time,
but you have to come now!

1498
02:07:38,231 --> 02:07:41,894
You take Fischer with you, all right?
- You can't stay here to be with her.

1499
02:07:44,471 --> 02:07:47,167
I'm not. Saito's dead by now.

1500
02:07:47,340 --> 02:07:50,832
That means he's down here somewhere.
That means I have to find him.

1501
02:07:52,846 --> 02:07:55,940
I can't stay with her anymore,
because she doesn't exist.

1502
02:07:56,116 --> 02:07:59,517
I'm the only thing
you do believe in anymore.

1503
02:07:59,686 --> 02:08:01,017
No.

1504
02:08:02,188 --> 02:08:03,621
I wish.

1505
02:08:05,225 --> 02:08:07,716
I wish more than anything, but...

1506
02:08:08,828 --> 02:08:11,558
...I can't imagine you
with all your complexity...

1507
02:08:11,731 --> 02:08:14,256
...all your perfection,
all your imperfection.

1508
02:08:15,368 --> 02:08:16,392
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1509
02:08:16,569 --> 02:08:18,400
Look at you.

1510
02:08:19,639 --> 02:08:24,576
You're just a shade.
You're just a shade of my real wife.

1511
02:08:25,011 --> 02:08:27,639
And you were the best
that I could do, but...

1512
02:08:28,481 --> 02:08:30,915
...I'm sorry, you're just not good enough.

1513
02:08:31,084 --> 02:08:32,711
Does this feel real?

1514
02:08:35,121 --> 02:08:37,715
- What are you doing?
- Improvising.

1515
02:08:46,333 --> 02:08:48,028
No, no, no!

1516
02:08:49,002 --> 02:08:51,402
In there, now. Go, go, go.

1517
02:09:36,249 --> 02:09:38,149
I was dis-

1518
02:09:39,853 --> 02:09:42,185
I was dis- Disa-

1519
02:09:43,056 --> 02:09:45,581
- I know, Dad.
- Dis-

1520
02:09:51,598 --> 02:09:53,691
I know you were disappointed...

1521
02:09:54,501 --> 02:09:55,866
...I couldn't be you.

1522
02:09:56,269 --> 02:09:57,759
No.

1523
02:09:58,271 --> 02:09:59,499
No, no, no.

1524
02:10:00,540 --> 02:10:02,531
I was disappointed...

1525
02:10:04,277 --> 02:10:06,211
...that you tried.

1526
02:10:29,469 --> 02:10:31,130
What?

1527
02:10:40,580 --> 02:10:41,706
Come on, come on.

1528
02:11:11,945 --> 02:11:13,435
Dad?

1529
02:11:51,785 --> 02:11:54,845
That's the kick, Ariadne!
You have to go now!

1530
02:12:07,700 --> 02:12:11,136
Don't lose yourself!
Find Saito and bring him back!

1531
02:12:11,304 --> 02:12:12,965
I will!

1532
02:12:52,712 --> 02:12:55,875
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

1533
02:12:56,049 --> 02:12:57,141
Yes.

1534
02:12:57,317 --> 02:13:00,377
You said you dreamt
that we'd grow old together.

1535
02:13:03,089 --> 02:13:04,579
But we did.

1536
02:13:06,526 --> 02:13:08,892
We did. You don't remember?

1537
02:13:13,566 --> 02:13:16,399
I miss you more than I can bear...

1538
02:13:18,771 --> 02:13:20,762
...but we had our time together.

1539
02:13:22,108 --> 02:13:24,167
And I have to let you go.

1540
02:13:26,279 --> 02:13:28,076
I have to let you go.

1541
02:14:19,332 --> 02:14:20,629
I'm sorry, Robert.

1542
02:14:48,294 --> 02:14:51,957
You know, the will means that Dad
wanted me to be my own man...

1543
02:14:53,032 --> 02:14:55,057
...not just to live for him.

1544
02:14:56,669 --> 02:14:59,194
That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.

1545
02:15:08,982 --> 02:15:10,210
What happened?

1546
02:15:10,683 --> 02:15:12,378
- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?

1547
02:15:12,552 --> 02:15:13,814
No, to find Saito.

1548
02:15:16,089 --> 02:15:17,852
He'll be lost.

1549
02:15:20,393 --> 02:15:22,224
No, he'll be all right.

1550
02:15:38,244 --> 02:15:40,212
Have you come to kill me?

1551
02:15:44,484 --> 02:15:46,952
I'm waiting for someone.

1552
02:15:51,424 --> 02:15:54,188
Someone from a half-remembered dream.

1553
02:15:56,929 --> 02:15:58,328
Cobb?

1554
02:16:00,266 --> 02:16:02,029
Impossible.

1555
02:16:02,568 --> 02:16:05,162
We were young men together.

1556
02:16:06,773 --> 02:16:09,105
I'm an old man.

1557
02:16:10,343 --> 02:16:12,402
Filled with regret.

1558
02:16:15,548 --> 02:16:18,244
Waiting to die alone.

1559
02:16:21,421 --> 02:16:23,582
I've come back for you.

1560
02:16:26,859 --> 02:16:30,727
To remind you of something.

1561
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,366
Something you once knew.

1562
02:16:39,238 --> 02:16:41,468
That this world is not real.

1563
02:16:46,379 --> 02:16:50,873
To convince me to honor
our arrangement?

1564
02:16:51,717 --> 02:16:54,481
To take a leap of faith, yes.

1565
02:17:00,593 --> 02:17:01,924
Come back...

1566
02:17:04,464 --> 02:17:07,831
...so we can be
young men together again.

1567
02:17:11,604 --> 02:17:13,572
Come back with me.

1568
02:17:16,676 --> 02:17:18,109
Come back.

1569
02:17:27,854 --> 02:17:29,549
Hot towel, sir?

1570
02:17:30,189 --> 02:17:33,056
We'll be landing in Los Angeles
in about 20 minutes.

1571
02:17:33,226 --> 02:17:35,524
Do you need immigration forms?

1572
02:17:37,630 --> 02:17:38,961
Thank you.

1573
02:17:39,432 --> 02:17:41,059
Hot towel, sir?

1574
02:17:42,068 --> 02:17:45,060
- No.
- Do you need immigration forms?

1575
02:18:56,442 --> 02:18:57,500
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.

1576
02:18:58,644 --> 02:19:00,271
Thank you, sir.

1577
02:19:44,323 --> 02:19:45,688
Welcome.

1578
02:19:46,158 --> 02:19:47,557
This way.

1579
02:20:08,748 --> 02:20:12,206
James? Phillipa?

1580
02:20:15,955 --> 02:20:17,217
Look who's here.

1581
02:20:22,828 --> 02:20:23,886
Hey.

1582
02:20:24,997 --> 02:20:27,693
- Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?
Daddy! Daddy!

1583
02:20:27,867 --> 02:20:30,131
Daddy!
How are you?

1584
02:20:31,237 --> 02:20:32,829
Look what I've been building!

1585
02:20:33,005 --> 02:20:36,702
- What are you building?
We're building a house on the cliff!

1586
02:20:36,876 --> 02:20:39,743
On the cliff? Come on, I want you
to show me. Can you show me?

1587
02:20:39,912 --> 02:20:42,472
Let's go.
Come on, Daddy!
