"00:01:16,820","00:01:19,660",I believe in America.
"00:01:19,740","00:01:22,700",America has made my fortune.
"00:01:22,790","00:01:26,920",And I raised my daughter in the American fashion.
"00:01:27,000","00:01:31,840","I gave her freedom, but I taught her never to dishonor her family."
"00:01:33,300","00:01:36,420","She found a boyfriend, not an Italian."
"00:01:36,510","00:01:40,930",She went to the movies with him. She stayed out late.
"00:01:41,010","00:01:42,720",I didn't protest.
"00:01:43,810","00:01:48,520",Two months ago he took her for a drive with another boyfriend.
"00:01:49,560","00:01:52,190",They made her drink whiskey
"00:01:52,270","00:01:56,650",and then they tried to take advantage of her.
"00:01:56,740","00:02:00,870","She resisted, she kept her honor."
"00:02:02,200","00:02:05,200",So they beat her like an animal.
"00:02:07,040","00:02:12,000","When I went to the hospital, her nose was broken,"
"00:02:12,090","00:02:16,550","her jaw was shattered, held together by wire."
"00:02:18,760","00:02:22,180",She couldn't even weep because of the pain.
"00:02:24,220","00:02:27,730",But I wept. Why did I weep?
"00:02:30,400","00:02:32,730",She was the light of my life.
"00:02:34,690","00:02:36,400",Beautiful girl.
"00:02:40,070","00:02:43,030",Now she will never be beautiful again.
"00:02:49,580","00:02:50,960",Sorry.
"00:02:59,260","00:03:03,930","I went to the police, like a good American."
"00:03:04,010","00:03:06,680",These two boys were brought to trial.
"00:03:07,770","00:03:10,560","The judge sentenced them to three years in prison,"
"00:03:10,640","00:03:12,770",but suspended the sentence.
"00:03:13,940","00:03:18,940",Suspended the sentence! They went free that very day!
"00:03:21,240","00:03:24,530",I stood in the courtroom like a fool.
"00:03:24,620","00:03:28,120","Those two bastards, they smiled at me."
"00:03:29,370","00:03:34,960","Then I said to my wife, ""For justice, we must go to Don Corleone."""
"00:03:40,380","00:03:44,760",Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first?
"00:03:44,890","00:03:50,980","What do you want of me? Tell me anything, but do what I beg you to do."
"00:03:51,060","00:03:52,730",What is that?
"00:04:03,860","00:04:05,700",I want them dead.
"00:04:17,340","00:04:19,130",That I cannot do.
"00:04:20,460","00:04:22,970",I'll give you anything you ask.
"00:04:25,260","00:04:30,890","I've known you many years, but this is the first time you've asked for help."
"00:04:32,060","00:04:37,110",I can't remember the last time you invited me for a cup of coffee.
"00:04:38,270","00:04:42,030",Even though my wife is godmother to your only child.
"00:04:42,110","00:04:47,120",But let's be Frank here. You never wanted my friendship.
"00:04:47,200","00:04:50,950",And you were afraid to be in my debt.
"00:04:51,040","00:04:53,450",I didn't want to get into trouble.
"00:04:54,580","00:04:56,210",I understand.
"00:04:57,710","00:05:00,590",You found Paradise in America.
"00:05:02,880","00:05:07,550","You made a good living, had police protection and there were courts of law."
"00:05:07,640","00:05:10,350",You didn't need a friend like me.
"00:05:11,890","00:05:15,560","But now you come to me and say,"
"00:05:15,640","00:05:18,060","""Don Corleone, give me justice."""
"00:05:19,980","00:05:22,820",But you don't ask with respect.
"00:05:22,900","00:05:27,610",You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather.
"00:05:29,320","00:05:36,210",You come on my daughter's wedding day and ask me to murder for money.
"00:05:36,290","00:05:38,830",I ask you for justice.
"00:05:38,920","00:05:41,920",That is not justice. Your daughter is alive.
"00:05:42,960","00:05:46,420","Let them suffer, then, as she suffers."
"00:05:48,550","00:05:50,850",How much shall I pay you?
"00:06:05,530","00:06:09,450","Bonasera, Bonasera."
"00:06:09,530","00:06:13,620",What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully?
"00:06:14,740","00:06:17,290","If you'd come in friendship,"
"00:06:17,370","00:06:21,790",the scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day.
"00:06:22,920","00:06:28,090","And if an honest man like you should make enemies, they'd be my enemies."
"00:06:31,010","00:06:33,850",And then they would fear you.
"00:06:37,350","00:06:39,480",Be my friend?
"00:06:43,440","00:06:44,980",Godfather?
"00:06:49,320","00:06:50,530",Good.
"00:06:52,660","00:06:57,830","Some day, and that day may never come, I'll ask a service of you."
"00:06:59,210","00:07:01,330",But until that day
"00:07:03,130","00:07:07,420",accept this justice as a gift on my daughter's wedding day.
"00:07:07,510","00:07:09,920","- Gràzie, Godfather. - Prego."
"00:07:16,970","00:07:19,680",Give this to Clemenza.
"00:07:21,980","00:07:25,440",I want people that aren't going to get carried away.
"00:07:25,520","00:07:29,690","We're not murderers, in spite of what this undertaker says."
"00:07:54,970","00:07:58,390","- Where's Michael? - Don't worry, he'll be here."
"00:07:59,520","00:08:02,600",We're not taking the picture without Michael.
"00:08:08,940","00:08:11,400",- What's the matter? - It's Michael.
"00:09:01,080","00:09:02,750",Don Barzini.
"00:09:19,050","00:09:22,430","Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine."
"00:09:22,520","00:09:24,770",Paulie! More wine.
"00:09:26,600","00:09:31,820",- You look terrific on the floor. - Are you a dance judge or something?
"00:09:31,900","00:09:34,150",Take a walk and do your job.
"00:09:41,910","00:09:45,160","Sandra, watch the kids. Don't let them run wild."
"00:09:45,250","00:09:47,710","You watch yourself, all right?"
"00:10:08,850","00:10:13,110","20, 30 grand. In small bills, cash."
"00:10:14,070","00:10:16,440",In that little silk purse.
"00:10:16,530","00:10:20,110",If this were somebody else's wedding... Sfortunato!
"00:10:20,200","00:10:21,450","Hey, Paulie!"
"00:10:21,530","00:10:25,330","I got two gabagool, capocol, and a prosciut."
"00:10:25,410","00:10:26,500",Stupid jerk!
"00:10:35,630","00:10:37,550",What's the matter?
"00:10:49,810","00:10:52,400",- Have to go back to work. - Tom.
"00:10:52,480","00:10:56,730",No Sicilian can refuse any request on his daughter's wedding day.
"00:11:02,450","00:11:07,580","Don Corleone, I'm honored and grateful that you have invited me."
"00:11:12,420","00:11:15,630",Get out of here! It's a private party. Go on!
"00:11:16,710","00:11:19,670",What is it? It's my sister's wedding.
"00:11:26,260","00:11:28,970",Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!
"00:11:31,980","00:11:35,360","Come here, come here, come here!"
"00:11:49,620","00:11:54,170","But towards the end, he was paroled to help with the American war effort,"
"00:11:54,250","00:11:57,340",so for six months he's worked in my pastry shop.
"00:11:57,420","00:12:00,170","Nazorine, what can I do for you?"
"00:12:00,260","00:12:02,220","Now that the war is over,"
"00:12:02,300","00:12:06,300","this boy, Enzo, they want to repatriate him back to Italy."
"00:12:06,390","00:12:11,270","Godfather, I have a daughter. You see, she and Enzo..."
"00:12:12,480","00:12:16,980","You want Enzo to stay in this country, and your daughter to be married."
"00:12:18,150","00:12:20,440",You understand everything.
"00:12:21,280","00:12:23,650",Mr. Hagen. Thank you.
"00:12:26,780","00:12:30,750",Wait till you see the wedding cake I made for your daughter!
"00:12:30,830","00:12:33,580","The bride, the groom and the angel..."
"00:12:38,840","00:12:43,380",- Who should I give this job to? - Not to our paisan.
"00:12:43,470","00:12:46,035",Give it to a Jew Congressman in another district.
"00:12:46,036","00:12:48,600",Who else is on the list?
"00:12:55,640","00:12:57,230","Hey, Michael!"
"00:13:17,040","00:13:20,500","He's not on the list, but Luca Brasi wants to see you."
"00:13:26,340","00:13:28,720",Is this necessary?
"00:13:28,800","00:13:33,430","He didn't expect to be invited to the wedding, so he wanted to thank you."
"00:13:34,770","00:13:40,190","Don Corleone, I'm honored and grateful that you have invited me"
"00:13:40,270","00:13:43,110",on the wedding day of your daughter.
"00:13:43,190","00:13:45,610",May their first child be a masculine child.
"00:13:46,820","00:13:48,240",Michael...
"00:13:50,030","00:13:53,410",That man over there is talking to himself.
"00:13:53,490","00:13:56,330",See that scary guy over there?
"00:13:56,410","00:13:59,920",- He's a very scary guy. - What's his name?
"00:14:00,000","00:14:04,670",His name is Luca Brasi. He helps my father out sometimes.
"00:14:06,470","00:14:09,390","Michael, he's coming over here!"
"00:14:13,720","00:14:15,560",You look terrific!
"00:14:15,640","00:14:18,940","My brother Tom Hagen, Miss Kay Adams."
"00:14:20,690","00:14:22,940",Your father's been asking for you.
"00:14:23,020","00:14:25,860",- Very nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
"00:14:27,610","00:14:30,320",Why does your brother have a different name?
"00:14:30,450","00:14:34,290",My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen in the street.
"00:14:34,370","00:14:38,290","He had no home, so my father took him in."
"00:14:40,040","00:14:43,130",He's been with us ever since.
"00:14:43,210","00:14:45,170",He's a good lawyer.
"00:14:46,010","00:14:50,590",Not a Sicilian. I think he's going to be consigliere.
"00:14:50,680","00:14:53,600","- What's that? - That's a,"
"00:14:53,680","00:14:57,470","like a counselor, an advisor. Very important for the family."
"00:14:58,480","00:15:00,640",You like your lasagna?
"00:15:04,900","00:15:07,110",Don Corleone.
"00:15:07,190","00:15:09,860",I'm honored and grateful
"00:15:09,950","00:15:13,780",that you have invited me to your daughter's wedding.
"00:15:18,790","00:15:22,080",On the day of your daughter's wedding.
"00:15:22,170","00:15:27,000",And I hope that their first child will be a masculine child.
"00:15:28,420","00:15:33,550",I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.
"00:15:35,510","00:15:40,940","- For your daughter's bridal purse. - Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend."
"00:15:41,020","00:15:46,150","Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you now, because I know you're busy."
"00:15:46,690","00:15:48,030",Thank you.
"00:16:37,530","00:16:39,870",Signora Corleone!
"00:16:41,080","00:16:43,910",No!
"00:17:53,030","00:17:58,110","Senator Cauley apologized for not coming, but said you'd understand."
"00:17:58,200","00:18:02,450",Also some of the judges. They've all sent gifts.
"00:18:05,500","00:18:06,710",What is that outside?
"00:18:15,800","00:18:20,340",Johnny! Johnny!
"00:18:21,390","00:18:23,060",I love you!
"00:18:33,360","00:18:36,780",He came all the way from California. I told you he'd come!
"00:18:36,860","00:18:40,360",- He's probably in trouble again. - He's a good godson.
"00:18:41,370","00:18:45,700","Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!"
"00:19:01,720","00:19:04,140",You never said you knew Johnny Fontane!
"00:19:04,220","00:19:08,310",- Sure. You want to meet him? - Great! Sure.
"00:19:08,390","00:19:12,230",- My father helped him with his career. - He did?
"00:19:12,310","00:19:13,400",How?
"00:19:15,940","00:19:18,780",- Let's listen to this song. - Michael...
"00:19:52,100","00:19:54,270","Please, Michael. Tell me."
"00:19:57,770","00:20:02,820","When Johnny was starting out, he was signed to a personal service contract"
"00:20:02,910","00:20:05,780",with a big bandleader.
"00:20:05,910","00:20:10,120","And as his career got better and better, he wanted to get out of it."
"00:20:11,160","00:20:13,870",Johnny is my father's godson.
"00:20:13,960","00:20:17,290",My father went to see this bandleader.
"00:20:17,380","00:20:21,260","He offered him $ 10,000 to let Johnny go,"
"00:20:21,340","00:20:24,090",but the bandleader said no.
"00:20:24,180","00:20:29,560","So the next day my father went to see him, but this time with Luca Brasi."
"00:20:31,310","00:20:33,560","Within an hour,"
"00:20:33,640","00:20:39,150","he signed a release for a certified check of $ 1,000."
"00:20:41,150","00:20:45,110",- How did he do that? - Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.
"00:20:46,780","00:20:51,660","- What was that? - Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,"
"00:20:51,790","00:20:57,000",and father said that either his brains or his signature would be on the contract.
"00:21:02,010","00:21:03,630",That's a true story.
"00:21:15,060","00:21:17,730","That's my family, Kay. It's not me."
"00:21:30,240","00:21:31,990",Beautiful!
"00:22:04,230","00:22:06,360",I'll take care of it.
"00:22:06,450","00:22:08,320",Tom...
"00:22:08,410","00:22:12,120",I want you to find Santino. Tell him to come to the office.
"00:22:19,370","00:22:22,340","How are you, Fredo?"
"00:22:22,420","00:22:25,010","My brother Fredo, this is Kay Adams."
"00:22:26,090","00:22:28,380",- Hi. - How are you doing?
"00:22:30,340","00:22:34,850",- This is my brother Mike. - Are you having a good time?
"00:22:34,930","00:22:37,520",Yeah. This is your friend?
"00:22:37,600","00:22:42,270",I don't know what to do. My voice is weak. It's weak.
"00:22:43,980","00:22:50,450","Anyway, if I had this part in the picture, it puts me right back on top again."
"00:22:50,530","00:22:55,870","But this... man won't give it to me, the head of the studio."
"00:22:55,950","00:22:59,210",- What's his name? - Woltz.
"00:22:59,290","00:23:03,460","He won't give it to me, and he says there's no chance."
"00:23:07,710","00:23:09,010",Sonny?
"00:23:10,630","00:23:11,800",Sonny?
"00:23:18,230","00:23:19,480",Sonny?
"00:23:20,310","00:23:23,060","- Sonny, are you in there? - What?"
"00:23:23,150","00:23:25,020",The old man wants you.
"00:23:26,270","00:23:27,980",One minute.
"00:23:42,420","00:23:47,460","A month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best-seller."
"00:23:47,550","00:23:51,130",The main character is a guy just like me.
"00:23:51,220","00:23:53,890",I wouldn't even have to act.
"00:23:54,850","00:23:57,680","Godfather, I don't know what to do."
"00:23:58,970","00:24:03,270",You can act like a man! What's the matter with you?
"00:24:03,350","00:24:09,070",Is this how you turned out? A Hollywood finocchio that cries like a woman?
"00:24:09,150","00:24:13,200","""What can I do? What can I do?"" What is that nonsense?"
"00:24:13,280","00:24:14,990",Ridiculous.
"00:24:19,700","00:24:22,830",- You spend time with your family? - Sure I do.
"00:24:22,910","00:24:24,579",Good.
"00:24:24,580","00:24:29,300",Because a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man.
"00:24:34,930","00:24:38,390",You look terrible. I want you to eat.
"00:24:38,470","00:24:43,770","Rest, and in a month this Hollywood big shot will give you what you want."
"00:24:43,850","00:24:46,980","It's too late, they start shooting in a week."
"00:24:47,060","00:24:50,230",I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.
"00:24:53,070","00:24:58,070","Just go outside and enjoy yourself, and forget about all this nonsense."
"00:25:00,240","00:25:03,290",- I want you to leave it all to me. - All right.
"00:25:28,360","00:25:33,650","- What time does my daughter leave? - Soon, after they cut the cake."
"00:25:33,740","00:25:37,360",Do we give your son-in-law something important?
"00:25:37,450","00:25:42,790","Never. Give him a living, but never discuss the family business with him."
"00:25:42,870","00:25:45,660",- What else? - Virgil Sollozzo called.
"00:25:45,790","00:25:50,210",- We'll have to see him next week. - When you come back from California.
"00:25:51,590","00:25:54,710",- When am I going to California? - Tonight.
"00:25:54,840","00:26:00,140",I want you to talk to this movie big shot and settle this business for Johnny.
"00:26:01,470","00:26:05,600","If there's nothing else, I'd like to go to my daughter's wedding."
"00:26:07,770","00:26:10,730","Carlo, we're going to take the picture."
"00:26:11,770","00:26:13,570",Wait a minute.
"00:26:13,650","00:26:15,940","No, Michael. Not me."
"00:26:20,450","00:26:23,330","Okay, that's it. Just like that. Hold it!"
"00:28:13,480","00:28:16,650",- You need a little more heat on that arc. - Start talking.
"00:28:16,730","00:28:20,150",I was sent by a friend of Johnny Fontane.
"00:28:20,240","00:28:23,990","This friend would give his friendship to Mr. Woltz,"
"00:28:24,070","00:28:26,910",if Mr. Woltz would grant us a favor.
"00:28:26,990","00:28:29,330",Woltz is listening.
"00:28:29,410","00:28:33,500",Give Johnny the part in that war film you're starting next week.
"00:28:39,210","00:28:44,220",And what favor would your friend grant Mr. Woltz?
"00:28:44,300","00:28:47,850",He could make your future union problems disappear.
"00:28:47,930","00:28:52,020",And one of your stars has just moved from marijuana to heroin.
"00:28:52,100","00:28:56,400","Are you trying to muscle me? Listen, you son-of-a-bitch!"
"00:28:56,480","00:28:59,070",Let me lay it on the line.
"00:28:59,150","00:29:01,150",Johnny Fontane will never get that movie!
"00:29:01,280","00:29:05,780",No matter how many Dago Guinea greaseballs come out of the woodwork!
"00:29:05,860","00:29:09,700","- I'm German-Irish. - Listen here, my Kraut-Mick friend."
"00:29:09,780","00:29:14,160",- I'm going to make trouble for you! - I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened...
"00:29:14,250","00:29:17,630",I know New York's big lawyers. Who are you?
"00:29:17,710","00:29:21,250",I have a special practice. I handle one client.
"00:29:21,340","00:29:23,340",I'll wait for your call.
"00:29:25,090","00:29:28,050","By the way, I admire your pictures very much."
"00:29:32,850","00:29:34,350",Check him out.
"00:29:56,870","00:29:59,420",- It's really beautiful. - Look at this.
"00:29:59,500","00:30:04,010",- It used to decorate a King's palace. - Very nice.
"00:30:04,090","00:30:06,470",Why didn't you say you work for Corleone?
"00:30:06,590","00:30:10,800",I thought you were some cheap hustler Johnny was running in.
"00:30:10,890","00:30:14,220",- I only use his name when necessary. - How's your drink?
"00:30:14,350","00:30:17,810",- Fine. - Now I'll show you something beautiful.
"00:30:17,890","00:30:20,480","You do appreciate beauty, don't you?"
"00:30:23,440","00:30:26,490","There you are. $600,000 on four hoofs."
"00:30:26,570","00:30:30,530",I bet Russian czars never paid that for a single horse.
"00:30:30,620","00:30:32,160",Khartoum.
"00:30:32,780","00:30:34,080",Khartoum.
"00:30:35,620","00:30:40,000","I'm not going to race him, though. I'm going to put him out to stud."
"00:30:41,580","00:30:43,130","Thanks, Tony."
"00:30:43,920","00:30:46,840",Let's get something to eat.
"00:30:46,920","00:30:50,340",Corleone is Johnny's godfather.
"00:30:50,430","00:30:54,850","To the Italian people that's a very sacred, close relationship."
"00:30:54,930","00:30:58,850",I respect it. Tell him to ask me anything else.
"00:30:58,940","00:31:01,270",This favor I can't give him.
"00:31:01,350","00:31:04,650",He never asks a second favor when he's been refused the first.
"00:31:04,770","00:31:10,910",You don't understand. Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.
"00:31:10,990","00:31:14,660",That part is perfect for him. It'll make him a big star.
"00:31:14,780","00:31:18,870","I'm going to run him out of the business, and let me tell you why."
"00:31:20,870","00:31:25,550",Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz International's most valuable protégés.
"00:31:25,630","00:31:31,010","We trained her for five years. Singing, acting, dancing lessons."
"00:31:31,130","00:31:35,720","I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on her, to make her a big star."
"00:31:35,810","00:31:38,600",Let me be even more Frank.
"00:31:38,680","00:31:41,185",To show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man.
"00:31:41,186","00:31:43,690",That it's not all dollars and cents.
"00:31:43,770","00:31:47,400",She was beautiful. She was young and innocent!
"00:31:47,480","00:31:52,910",She's the greatest piece of ass I've had and I've had them all over the world.
"00:31:52,990","00:31:59,120",Then Johnny Fontane comes along with his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.
"00:31:59,200","00:32:00,910",And she runs off.
"00:32:02,250","00:32:06,340",She threw it all away just to make me look ridiculous!
"00:32:06,420","00:32:11,590",And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous!
"00:32:11,670","00:32:14,010",You get the hell out of here!
"00:32:14,090","00:32:18,470","If that goombah tries any rough stuff, tell him I'm no bandleader."
"00:32:19,770","00:32:22,770","Yeah, I heard that story."
"00:32:23,600","00:32:27,610",Thank you for dinner and a very pleasant evening.
"00:32:27,690","00:32:30,570",Maybe your car can take me to the airport.
"00:32:30,650","00:32:34,240",Mr. Corleone insists on hearing bad news immediately.
"00:34:26,930","00:34:30,860","- You're not too tired, are you, Tom? - No, I slept on the plane."
"00:34:30,940","00:34:34,030",I have the Sollozzo notes here.
"00:34:34,110","00:34:35,360",Now...
"00:34:37,320","00:34:40,910",Sollozzo is known as The Turk.
"00:34:40,990","00:34:42,950","He's supposed to be very good with a knife,"
"00:34:43,030","00:34:47,460",but only in matters of business with reasonable complaint.
"00:34:47,540","00:34:50,790",His business is narcotics.
"00:34:50,880","00:34:54,250","He has fields in Turkey, where they grow poppy."
"00:34:54,340","00:34:58,170",In Sicily he has plants to process them into heroin.
"00:34:58,260","00:35:01,760","He needs cash, he needs protection from the police."
"00:35:01,840","00:35:05,770",He'll give a piece of the action. I don't know how much.
"00:35:05,890","00:35:11,100",The Tattaglia family is behind him here. They have to be in it for something.
"00:35:12,400","00:35:16,980","- What about his prison record? - One term in Italy, one here."
"00:35:17,070","00:35:19,820",He's known as a top narcotics man.
"00:35:19,900","00:35:24,580","- Santino, what do you think? - A lot of money in that white powder."
"00:35:26,910","00:35:28,290",Tom?
"00:35:28,370","00:35:32,540",Yes. There's more money in narcotics than anything else.
"00:35:32,630","00:35:37,380","If we don't get into it, somebody else will, maybe the five families."
"00:35:37,460","00:35:41,930",With that money they can buy more police and political power.
"00:35:42,010","00:35:44,100",Then they come after us.
"00:35:44,220","00:35:50,730","Now we have unions and gambling, and that's great, but narcotics is the future."
"00:35:50,810","00:35:55,940","If we don't get a piece of that action, we risk everything in 10 years' time."
"00:36:00,490","00:36:03,570","So? What's your answer going to be, Pop?"
"00:36:08,330","00:36:10,080",Don Corleone.
"00:36:12,170","00:36:15,460",I need a man who has powerful friends.
"00:36:15,590","00:36:18,300",I need a million dollars in cash.
"00:36:18,380","00:36:24,220","I need those politicians that you carry in your pocket, like nickels and dimes."
"00:36:25,680","00:36:29,680",- What is the interest for my family? - 30%.
"00:36:29,770","00:36:33,730","In the first year your end should be three, four million dollars."
"00:36:33,810","00:36:35,810",And then it would go up.
"00:36:37,020","00:36:40,440",And what is the interest for the Tattaglia family?
"00:36:42,450","00:36:44,280",My compliments.
"00:36:47,950","00:36:51,370","I'll take care of them, out of my share."
"00:36:51,450","00:36:55,750","So I receive 30% for finance,"
"00:36:55,830","00:36:59,170",political influence and legal protection?
"00:36:59,250","00:37:00,960",That's right.
"00:37:02,260","00:37:06,180",Why do you come to me? Why do I deserve this generosity?
"00:37:06,260","00:37:11,560","If you consider a million dollars in cash just finance,"
"00:37:11,640","00:37:13,810",te salud Don Corleone.
"00:37:24,320","00:37:29,580","I said that I would see you, because I heard you were a serious man,"
"00:37:29,660","00:37:31,910",to be treated with respect.
"00:37:36,580","00:37:39,880","But, I must say no to you."
"00:37:41,050","00:37:43,880",And I'll give you my reason.
"00:37:43,970","00:37:46,800","It's true, I have a lot of friends in politics."
"00:37:48,050","00:37:52,470","They wouldn't be friendly long if I was involved in drugs instead of gambling,"
"00:37:52,560","00:37:58,190","which they regard as a harmless vice, but drugs is a dirty business."
"00:37:58,270","00:38:03,280",It doesn't make any difference to me what a man does for a living.
"00:38:03,360","00:38:08,610",But your business is... a little dangerous.
"00:38:08,700","00:38:13,120","If you're worried about security, the Tattaglias will guarantee it."
"00:38:13,200","00:38:16,710",- The Tattaglias would guarantee our... - Wait a minute.
"00:38:24,010","00:38:28,800","I have a sentimental weakness for my children, and I spoil them."
"00:38:28,880","00:38:32,140",They talk when they should listen. But anyway...
"00:38:32,260","00:38:37,640","Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to congratulate you on your new business."
"00:38:37,730","00:38:41,190","I know you'll do well, and good luck."
"00:38:41,270","00:38:46,110",Especially since your interests don't conflict with mine. Thank you.
"00:39:06,760","00:39:08,670",Santino.
"00:39:08,760","00:39:10,590",Come here.
"00:39:12,930","00:39:14,850",What's the matter with you?
"00:39:14,930","00:39:19,560",Your brain is going soft from playing with that girl.
"00:39:19,640","00:39:23,770",Never tell anybody outside the family what you're thinking again.
"00:39:25,070","00:39:26,320",Go on.
"00:39:30,280","00:39:33,120","Tom, what's this nonsense?"
"00:39:33,200","00:39:36,620",It's from Johnny. He's starring in that new film.
"00:39:38,950","00:39:41,540",- Take it away. - Take it over there.
"00:39:42,830","00:39:44,380",And
"00:39:45,420","00:39:47,590",tell Luca Brasi to come in.
"00:39:53,720","00:39:57,140",I'm a little worried about this Sollozzo fellow.
"00:39:57,220","00:40:00,180",Find out what he's got under his fingernails.
"00:40:01,190","00:40:04,810",Go to the Tattaglias.
"00:40:04,900","00:40:09,190",Make them think that you're not too happy with our family
"00:40:10,570","00:40:12,950",and find out what you can.
"00:40:30,420","00:40:33,720",I got something for your mother and for Sonny
"00:40:33,800","00:40:38,470","and a tie for Freddy, and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen."
"00:40:38,560","00:40:41,810",- What do you want for Christmas? - Just you.
"00:41:13,720","00:41:15,630","Andiamo, Fredo."
"00:41:15,720","00:41:19,140","- Tell Paulie to get the car. - Okay, Pop."
"00:41:19,220","00:41:23,230",I'll have to get it myself. Paulie called in sick this morning.
"00:41:24,980","00:41:28,230",Paulie's a good kid. I don't mind getting the car.
"00:41:31,650","00:41:33,820","Buon natale, Caro. Gràzie."
"00:42:16,450","00:42:20,740",- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia. - I know.
"00:42:30,670","00:42:31,670",You know who I am?
"00:42:31,750","00:42:33,090",I know you.
"00:42:34,380","00:42:37,970",You have been talking to the Tattaglia family... right?
"00:42:38,970","00:42:42,970",I think you and I can do business.
"00:42:44,810","00:42:47,480",I need someone strong like you.
"00:42:48,100","00:42:50,940",I heard you are not happy...
"00:42:51,360","00:42:53,650",with the Corleone family.
"00:42:54,400","00:42:56,150",Want to join me?
"00:42:57,320","00:42:59,280",What's in it for me?
"00:43:01,910","00:43:04,830","$50,000 to start with."
"00:43:06,830","00:43:08,080",Not bad!
"00:43:09,750","00:43:11,380",Agreed?
"00:44:10,810","00:44:14,520",Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.
"00:44:14,650","00:44:19,570",- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you. - I haven't got time.
"00:44:19,650","00:44:22,700","Make time, Consigliere. Get in the car."
"00:44:24,530","00:44:29,040","What are you worried about? If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already."
"00:44:29,120","00:44:30,580",Get in.
"00:44:41,590","00:44:45,300","- Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit. - Okay, Pop."
"00:44:52,100","00:44:54,940",Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.
"00:46:22,480","00:46:26,530",Would you like me better if I were a nun? Like in the story.
"00:46:29,660","00:46:30,660",No.
"00:46:30,740","00:46:35,120","- What if I were Ingrid Bergman? - Now, that's a thought."
"00:46:37,710","00:46:39,670",Michael.
"00:46:39,750","00:46:42,170","No, I wouldn't like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman."
"00:46:42,250","00:46:44,050",What's the matter?
"00:47:00,940","00:47:03,610",They don't say if he's dead or alive.
"00:47:25,880","00:47:29,170","- Sonny, it's Michael. - Where have you been?"
"00:47:29,260","00:47:32,010",- Is he all right? - We don't know yet.
"00:47:32,090","00:47:36,140","There are all kinds of stories. He was hit bad, Mikey."
"00:47:38,100","00:47:41,350","- Are you there? - Yeah, I'm here."
"00:47:41,480","00:47:46,360",- Where have you been? I was worried. - Didn't Tom tell you I called?
"00:47:46,440","00:47:50,490","No. Look, come home, kid. You should be with Mama, you hear?"
"00:47:57,950","00:47:59,540","Oh, my God."
"00:48:03,540","00:48:04,960",Sonny!
"00:48:13,840","00:48:16,140",Stay back there.
"00:48:16,220","00:48:18,890","- Who is it? - Open up, it's Clemenza."
"00:48:21,310","00:48:24,560",There's more news about your old man.
"00:48:24,650","00:48:26,820",Word is out that he's already dead.
"00:48:27,230","00:48:31,150",- What's the matter with you? - Take it easy!
"00:48:31,320","00:48:34,570",- Where was Paulie? - Sick. He's been sick all winter.
"00:48:34,660","00:48:37,080","- How often? - Only three, four times."
"00:48:37,160","00:48:40,950",- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard. - Pick him up now.
"00:48:41,040","00:48:45,880",I don't care how sick he is. Bring him to my father's house right now.
"00:48:45,960","00:48:49,050",- You want anyone sent over here? - No. Go ahead.
"00:48:58,220","00:49:02,230",I'm going to have a couple of our people come over to the house.
"00:49:05,150","00:49:07,310",- Hello? - Santino Corleone?
"00:49:07,400","00:49:10,230",- Yeah. - We have Tom Hagen.
"00:49:10,320","00:49:14,030",In three hours he'll be released with our proposition.
"00:49:14,110","00:49:17,450",Listen to what he has to say before you do anything.
"00:49:17,530","00:49:22,160","What's done is done. Don't lose that famous temper of yours, Sonny."
"00:49:22,250","00:49:23,960",I'll wait.
"00:49:38,300","00:49:40,310",Your boss is dead.
"00:49:43,140","00:49:47,560","I know you're not in the muscle end of the family, so don't be scared."
"00:49:48,650","00:49:52,530",I want you to help the Corleones and me.
"00:49:56,490","00:50:00,990",We got him outside his office about an hour after we picked you up.
"00:50:02,410","00:50:03,700",Drink it.
"00:50:08,460","00:50:11,920",It's up to you to make peace between me and Sonny.
"00:50:16,130","00:50:18,930","Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?"
"00:50:20,300","00:50:23,140",And you knew it was the right thing to do.
"00:50:24,310","00:50:29,440","- Sonny will come after you. - That will be his first reaction, sure."
"00:50:30,860","00:50:37,360",So you have to talk sense into him. The Tattaglia family is behind me.
"00:50:37,450","00:50:42,530",The other New York families will go along with anything to prevent war.
"00:50:42,620","00:50:47,830","Let's face it, with all due respect, the Don rest in peace was slipping."
"00:50:50,830","00:50:53,840","Ten years ago, could I have gotten to him?"
"00:50:57,720","00:51:01,680","Well, now he's dead, Tom, and nothing can bring him back."
"00:51:03,470","00:51:09,350","You've got to talk to Sonny, to the Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza."
"00:51:14,320","00:51:16,400","It's good business, Tom."
"00:51:17,780","00:51:22,620",I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
"00:51:25,660","00:51:27,450","Yeah, well..."
"00:51:29,290","00:51:31,670",Let me worry about Luca.
"00:51:36,880","00:51:39,260",You just talk to Sonny.
"00:51:39,340","00:51:41,590",And the other two kids.
"00:51:44,550","00:51:47,060",- I'll do my best. - Good.
"00:51:49,430","00:51:51,850",Now you can go.
"00:51:58,690","00:52:03,370","I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman."
"00:52:03,450","00:52:05,910",Blood is a big expense.
"00:52:27,140","00:52:29,020",He's still alive.
"00:52:29,100","00:52:33,060","They hit him with five shots, and he's still alive!"
"00:52:33,150","00:52:37,900","That's bad luck for me, and bad luck for you if you don't make that deal."
"00:53:22,610","00:53:25,030",Your mother is at the hospital with your father.
"00:53:25,031","00:53:27,450",Looks like he'll pull through.
"00:53:29,280","00:53:35,920","It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon..."
"00:53:36,000","00:53:39,420",- You gonna kill all those guys? - Stay out of it.
"00:53:39,500","00:53:41,960","If you get rid of Sollozzo, everything falls into line."
"00:53:42,050","00:53:46,340",What about Luca? Sollozzo thinks he can control him.
"00:53:46,430","00:53:50,220","If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble."
"00:53:50,310","00:53:53,890",- Has anyone been in touch with Luca? - We've been trying all night.
"00:53:53,980","00:53:58,020","- Hey, do me a favor... - Luca never sleeps over with a broad."
"00:54:00,110","00:54:05,320","Well, Tom, you're consigliere. What do we do if the old man dies?"
"00:54:06,450","00:54:12,660","If we lose the old man, we lose the political contacts and half our strength."
"00:54:12,740","00:54:18,420",The other New York families might support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.
"00:54:18,500","00:54:23,050",This is almost 1946. Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.
"00:54:23,130","00:54:24,800",If your father dies
"00:54:27,220","00:54:28,970",you make the deal.
"00:54:29,050","00:54:33,930",- Easy to say. He's not your father. - I'm as much a son as you or Mike.
"00:54:38,520","00:54:40,020",What is it?
"00:54:41,020","00:54:46,820","- Paulie, I told you to stay put. - The guy at the gates has a package."
"00:54:46,900","00:54:49,030","Tessio, go see what it is."
"00:54:52,370","00:54:54,620",- Shall I stay? - Yeah. Are you all right?
"00:54:54,700","00:54:58,460",- I'm fine. - There's food. Are you hungry?
"00:54:58,540","00:55:02,130",- No. - A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.
"00:55:02,210","00:55:04,840",- Go ahead. - That might be a good idea.
"00:55:06,590","00:55:12,640",Take care of that son-of-a-bitch. Paulie sold out the old man.
"00:55:12,720","00:55:16,310",- Make that the first thing on your list. - Understood.
"00:55:16,390","00:55:20,690","Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys and go to Luca's apartment."
"00:55:20,770","00:55:24,480",Maybe we shouldn't get Mike mixed up in this too directly.
"00:55:27,030","00:55:30,740",Hanging around the house on the phone would be a big help.
"00:55:31,610","00:55:33,530",Try Luca again.
"00:55:42,460","00:55:45,210",- What's this? - A Sicilian message.
"00:55:45,300","00:55:48,170",It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.
"00:56:01,900","00:56:03,980",- I'm going. - When will you be home?
"00:56:04,060","00:56:05,730",Probably late.
"00:56:08,280","00:56:11,950","- Don't forget the cannoli! - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"00:56:14,200","00:56:18,700","Rocco, sit on the other side. You block the rear-view mirror."
"00:56:20,250","00:56:23,670",Sonny's running wild. He wants to go to mattresses already.
"00:56:23,750","00:56:29,630",We have to find a spot on the West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.
"00:56:29,710","00:56:33,220",- Know a good spot on the West Side? - I'll think about it.
"00:56:33,300","00:56:37,060",Think while you're driving. I want to hit New York this month.
"00:56:37,140","00:56:38,890",Watch the kids.
"00:56:49,780","00:56:55,570","Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up 18 mattresses and bring me the bill."
"00:56:55,660","00:56:57,080","Yeah, all right."
"00:56:57,160","00:57:01,580","Make sure they're clean, because the guys will be there a long time."
"00:57:01,660","00:57:05,920",- They're clean and exterminated. - That's a bad word to use.
"00:57:06,000","00:57:09,960","Exterminate! Watch out, so we don't exterminate you!"
"00:57:16,680","00:57:19,180",Pull over. I've got to take a leak.
"00:58:01,060","00:58:04,270",Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.
"00:58:22,450","00:58:25,330","Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!"
"00:58:27,250","00:58:29,380",- Yeah. - Phone call!
"00:58:35,420","00:58:37,630",- Who is it? - Some girl.
"00:58:41,930","00:58:44,350",- Hello. Kay? - How's your father?
"00:58:44,430","00:58:46,430",He's going to make it.
"00:58:46,890","00:58:48,730",I love you.
"00:58:50,150","00:58:51,770",I love you!
"00:58:52,610","00:58:55,240","- Michael? - Yeah, I know."
"00:58:55,320","00:58:58,240",- Tell me you love me. - I can't talk.
"00:58:58,320","00:59:00,200",Can't you say it?
"00:59:01,410","00:59:03,280",I'll see you tonight.
"00:59:04,080","00:59:07,210",Why don't you tell that nice girl you love her?
"00:59:07,290","00:59:12,090","I love you with all my heart. If I don't see you again soon, I'm going to die!"
"00:59:13,170","00:59:18,050",Come and learn something. You might have to cook for 20 guys some day.
"00:59:18,130","00:59:21,760","You start with a little oil, then fry some garlic."
"00:59:21,890","00:59:27,520","Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, fry it and make sure it doesn't stick."
"00:59:27,600","00:59:31,690","You get it to a boil, you shove in all your sausage and meatballs."
"00:59:33,570","00:59:35,650",Add a little bit of wine.
"00:59:38,900","00:59:43,320",And a little bit of sugar. That's my trick.
"00:59:43,450","00:59:47,700",Cut the crap. I have more important things for you. How's Paulie?
"00:59:47,790","00:59:50,000",You won't see him no more.
"00:59:51,460","00:59:53,960",- Where are you going? - To the city.
"00:59:54,040","00:59:57,550",- Send bodyguards with him. - I'm going to the hospital...
"00:59:57,630","01:00:00,970",He'll be all right. Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.
"01:00:01,050","01:00:03,050","- Be careful. - Yes, sir."
"01:00:06,180","01:00:08,470",Send somebody with him anyway.
"01:00:36,540","01:00:39,590",- I have to go. - Can I go with you?
"01:00:41,380","01:00:45,720","No, Kay. There will be detectives there, people from the press."
"01:00:45,800","01:00:47,930",I'll wait in the cab.
"01:00:50,560","01:00:53,190",I don't want you to get involved.
"01:00:55,900","01:00:58,150",When will I see you again?
"01:01:04,490","01:01:08,620","Go back to New Hampshire, and I'll call you at your parents' house."
"01:01:10,370","01:01:15,080","- When will I see you again, Michael? - I don't know."
"01:03:27,300","01:03:31,140",What are you doing here? You're not supposed to be here.
"01:03:31,220","01:03:34,720",I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.
"01:03:34,810","01:03:37,140",What happened to the guards?
"01:03:37,230","01:03:42,650",Your father had too many visitors. They interfered with hospital service.
"01:03:42,730","01:03:46,070",The police made them leave about 10 minutes ago.
"01:03:50,570","01:03:54,530","Get me Long Beach 45620, please."
"01:03:57,080","01:03:59,410",Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.
"01:04:03,460","01:04:08,300","Sonny, I'm at the hospital. I got here late, there's nobody here."
"01:04:08,420","01:04:12,680","No Tessio's men, no detectives, nobody. Papa's all alone."
"01:04:12,760","01:04:15,260",- Don't panic. - I won't panic.
"01:04:16,720","01:04:19,600","I'm sorry, but you will have to leave."
"01:04:22,310","01:04:25,150",We're going to move him to another room.
"01:04:25,230","01:04:28,230",Can you disconnect the tubes?
"01:04:28,320","01:04:31,860",- That's out of the question! - Do you know my father?
"01:04:31,950","01:04:36,240",Men are coming here to kill him. Do you understand?
"01:04:36,330","01:04:38,120","Help me, please."
"01:05:55,200","01:05:58,990","- Who are you? - I am Enzo, the Baker."
"01:06:00,030","01:06:02,080",- Remember me? - Enzo.
"01:06:02,160","01:06:05,290","You'd better go, there's going to be trouble."
"01:06:05,370","01:06:10,000","If there is trouble, I'll stay here to help you. For your father."
"01:06:12,000","01:06:16,130","Listen. Wait for me outside, in front of the hospital, all right?"
"01:06:16,220","01:06:18,300",I'll be out in a minute.
"01:06:32,070","01:06:35,820","Just lie here, Pop. I'll take care of you now."
"01:06:37,780","01:06:39,820",I'm with you now.
"01:06:41,450","01:06:42,990",I'm with you.
"01:07:18,450","01:07:20,610",Get rid of these. Come here.
"01:07:21,570","01:07:23,785","Put your hand in your pocket, like you have a gun."
"01:07:23,786","01:07:26,000",You'll be all right.
"01:08:17,340","01:08:19,010",You did good.
"01:09:07,560","01:09:10,770",I thought all you Guinea hoods were locked up!
"01:09:10,890","01:09:15,480",- Why isn't anyone guarding my father? - You little punk!
"01:09:15,560","01:09:19,480",Don't you tell me my business! I pulled them off.
"01:09:19,610","01:09:25,530",- Stay away from this hospital! - Not until my father's room is guarded.
"01:09:26,370","01:09:29,660","- Phil, take him in! - The kid's clean, Captain."
"01:09:29,740","01:09:33,580",- He's a war hero. He's never been... - I said take him in!
"01:09:35,750","01:09:42,010",- What's The Turk paying you? - Take a hold of him. Stand him up.
"01:09:42,090","01:09:43,970",Stand him up straight.
"01:10:06,110","01:10:11,740",I'm the Corleones' attorney. These men are hired to protect Vito Corleone.
"01:10:11,830","01:10:14,250",They're licensed to carry firearms.
"01:10:14,330","01:10:18,750","If you interfere, you'll have to appear before the judge and show 'cause."
"01:10:18,830","01:10:20,840",Let him go.
"01:10:53,240","01:10:57,160",- What's with all the new faces? - We'll need them now.
"01:10:57,250","01:11:00,130","After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad."
"01:11:00,210","01:11:03,380",We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.
"01:11:04,510","01:11:06,510",Jesus Christ.
"01:11:13,180","01:11:15,680",Looks like a fortress around here.
"01:11:17,810","01:11:23,190",Tamaduch! Hey... 100 buttonmen on the street 24 hours a day.
"01:11:23,270","01:11:26,860","That Turk shows one hair on his ass, he's dead."
"01:11:28,900","01:11:30,990","Mike, let me look at you."
"01:11:35,040","01:11:38,080","You're beautiful, beautiful. You're gorgeous."
"01:11:38,210","01:11:43,790",The Turk wants to talk! Imagine the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.
"01:11:43,880","01:11:46,630",- He wants a meeting today. - What did he say?
"01:11:46,760","01:11:51,550",What did he say... He wants us to send Michael to hear the proposition.
"01:11:51,640","01:11:55,100",He promises that the deal is too good to refuse.
"01:11:55,180","01:11:58,270",- And Bruno Tattaglia? - That's part of the deal.
"01:11:58,350","01:12:02,650",- He cancels out what they did to Father. - We should listen to them.
"01:12:02,730","01:12:05,860","No more! Not this time, Consigliere."
"01:12:05,940","01:12:09,490","No more meetings, discussions, or Sollozzo tricks."
"01:12:09,570","01:12:12,610","I want Sollozzo, or we go to war..."
"01:12:12,700","01:12:15,660",- The other families... - They hand me Sollozzo!
"01:12:15,740","01:12:18,040","This is business, not personal!"
"01:12:18,120","01:12:22,540","- They shot my father... - Even that was business, not personal."
"01:12:23,460","01:12:27,210",Then business will have to suffer. Do me a favor.
"01:12:27,300","01:12:31,300",No more advice on how to patch things up. Just help me win.
"01:12:37,600","01:12:41,520","I found out about Captain McCluskey, who broke Mike's jaw."
"01:12:41,600","01:12:45,900","He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money."
"01:12:45,980","01:12:50,030",McCluskey has agreed to be The Turk's bodyguard.
"01:12:50,110","01:12:53,860","So when Sollozzo is being guarded, he's invulnerable."
"01:12:53,950","01:12:57,530",Nobody has ever gunned down a New York police captain.
"01:12:57,660","01:13:03,580",All the families would come after you. The Corleone family would be outcasts!
"01:13:03,670","01:13:07,500",Even the old man's political protection would run for cover.
"01:13:08,800","01:13:12,630",Do me a favor. Take this into consideration.
"01:13:16,470","01:13:18,470","All right, we'll wait."
"01:13:23,890","01:13:26,730",We can't wait. We can't wait.
"01:13:28,190","01:13:32,150","No matter what Sollozzo says, he's going to kill Pop."
"01:13:32,240","01:13:35,950",That's the key for him. We've got to get Sollozzo.
"01:13:36,030","01:13:40,330",- Mike is right. - Let me ask you something.
"01:13:40,410","01:13:45,000",What about this McCluskey? What do we do with this cop?
"01:13:50,170","01:13:53,050","They want to have a meeting with me, right?"
"01:13:53,920","01:13:58,350","It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo."
"01:14:00,350","01:14:02,350",Let's set the meeting.
"01:14:04,520","01:14:08,230",Get our informers to find out where it's going to be held.
"01:14:10,070","01:14:13,860","We insist it's a public place. A bar, a restaurant."
"01:14:13,940","01:14:17,700","Some place where there are people, so I feel safe."
"01:14:20,450","01:14:23,450","They'll search me when I meet them, right?"
"01:14:23,540","01:14:25,870",So I can't have a weapon on me.
"01:14:29,250","01:14:34,210",But if Clemenza can figure out a way to have a weapon planted there for me
"01:14:39,180","01:14:41,390",then I'll kill them both.
"01:14:53,480","01:14:58,200",Nice college boy. Didn't want to get mixed up in the family business.
"01:14:58,320","01:15:01,950",Now you want to shoot a police captain because he slapped you?
"01:15:02,080","01:15:08,580",This isn't like the army! You have to get close and get their brains on your suit.
"01:15:08,670","01:15:11,710",You're taking this very personal.
"01:15:11,790","01:15:15,210","Tom, this is business and he's taking it personal."
"01:15:15,340","01:15:18,800",- Where does it say you can't kill a cop? - Mikey...
"01:15:18,930","01:15:25,020","I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up in drugs, a dishonest cop."
"01:15:26,060","01:15:30,350",A cop who got mixed up in the rackets and got what was coming.
"01:15:30,480","01:15:35,030","That's a terrific story. We have newspaper people on the payroll, right?"
"01:15:36,490","01:15:40,320",- They might like a story like that. - They might.
"01:15:43,990","01:15:47,580","It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business."
"01:15:50,790","01:15:52,330",It's as cold as they come.
"01:15:52,420","01:15:55,670","Impossible to trace, so you don't worry about prints."
"01:15:56,090","01:16:00,130",I put a special tape on the trigger and the butt. Try it.
"01:16:12,310","01:16:14,400",Is the trigger too tight?
"01:16:17,730","01:16:18,940",My ears!
"01:16:19,030","01:16:23,660","I left it noisy, so it scares away any pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders."
"01:16:24,830","01:16:27,740",You've shot them both. Now what do you do?
"01:16:30,120","01:16:33,790","- Sit down, finish my dinner. - Don't fool around."
"01:16:33,880","01:16:37,420",Let your hand drop to your side and let the gun slip out.
"01:16:37,500","01:16:41,930","Everybody will still think you've got it. They'll stare at your face,"
"01:16:42,010","01:16:44,890","so walk out fast, but don't run."
"01:16:44,970","01:16:48,390","Don't look anybody in the eye, but don't look away either."
"01:16:48,470","01:16:51,980","They'll be scared stiff, so don't worry about nothing."
"01:16:54,020","01:16:58,280","You'll be all right. You'll take a vacation, nobody knows where,"
"01:16:58,360","01:17:00,440",and we'll catch the hell.
"01:17:01,070","01:17:04,910",- How bad do you think it will be? - Pretty goddamn bad.
"01:17:04,990","01:17:08,040",All the other families will probably line up against us.
"01:17:08,160","01:17:10,935","These things have to happen every five, 10 years."
"01:17:10,936","01:17:13,710",Gets rid of the bad blood.
"01:17:13,830","01:17:18,250",Been 10 years since the last one. You have to stop them at the beginning.
"01:17:18,380","01:17:24,090","Like they should have stopped Hitler in Munich, not letting him get away with it."
"01:17:25,510","01:17:30,020","You know, Mike, we were all proud of you. Being a hero and all."
"01:17:30,100","01:17:31,810",Your father too.
"01:18:09,890","01:18:13,310",Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.
"01:18:14,270","01:18:18,520",Even Sollozzo's people don't know where the meeting will be held.
"01:18:18,610","01:18:20,940",How much time do we have?
"01:18:21,820","01:18:26,610",They're going to pick you up outside Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.
"01:18:27,610","01:18:32,490",- We could put a tail on them. - Sollozzo would lose our ass.
"01:18:33,870","01:18:38,420",- What about the negotiator? - He's playing pinochle with my men.
"01:18:38,540","01:18:43,630",- He's happy. They're letting him win. - Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.
"01:18:43,710","01:18:47,090",The negotiator plays cards until Mike is back safe.
"01:18:47,180","01:18:51,220",- He could blast whoever is in the car. - They'll expect that.
"01:18:51,300","01:18:54,640","Sollozzo might not even be in the car, Sonny!"
"01:18:54,730","01:18:56,230",I'll get it.
"01:19:21,500","01:19:23,670",Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.
"01:19:23,750","01:19:27,090",- Is it reliable? - My man in McCluskey's precinct.
"01:19:27,220","01:19:32,930",A police captain is on call 24 hours a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10.
"01:19:33,010","01:19:37,890","- Anybody know this joint? - Sure, I do. It's perfect for us."
"01:19:37,980","01:19:42,940","A small family place, good food. Everyone minds his business. Perfect."
"01:19:43,690","01:19:48,860","They've got an old-fashioned toilet. You know, the box and the chain thing."
"01:19:50,860","01:19:53,950",We might be able to tape the gun behind it.
"01:19:54,030","01:19:58,160","All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,"
"01:19:58,250","01:20:02,130","you eat, talk for a while, you relax. Make them relax."
"01:20:02,210","01:20:07,550","Then you go to take a leak. No, better still, you ask permission to go."
"01:20:07,630","01:20:12,090",Then you come back blasting. Two shots in the head apiece.
"01:20:13,850","01:20:16,350",I want somebody very good to plant that gun.
"01:20:16,430","01:20:19,940",I don't want him coming out with just his dick.
"01:20:20,020","01:20:25,570",- The gun will be there. - You drive him and pick him up.
"01:20:25,650","01:20:27,320",Let's move.
"01:20:32,820","01:20:35,990",Did he tell you to drop the gun right away?
"01:20:36,080","01:20:37,950","Yeah, a million times."
"01:20:42,710","01:20:46,920",Don't forget. Two shots apiece in the head as soon as you come out.
"01:20:53,510","01:20:57,100",How long do you think it will be before I can come back?
"01:20:57,930","01:21:00,020",At least a year.
"01:21:00,140","01:21:04,940","I'll square it with Mom, that you're not seeing her before you leave and..."
"01:21:06,480","01:21:10,320",I'll get a message to that girlfriend when the time is right.
"01:21:16,160","01:21:17,660",Take care.
"01:21:20,450","01:21:22,210","Take care, Mike."
"01:21:55,030","01:21:58,830",I'm glad you came. I hope we can straighten everything out.
"01:22:00,040","01:22:05,120",It's not the way I wanted things to go. It should never have happened.
"01:22:05,250","01:22:09,540",I want to straighten everything out. I don't want my father bothered again.
"01:22:09,630","01:22:12,880","I swear on my children that he won't be, Mike."
"01:22:13,880","01:22:17,180",But you have to keep an open mind when we talk.
"01:22:17,260","01:22:21,680",I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny. You can't talk business with him.
"01:22:23,560","01:22:25,230",He's a good kid.
"01:22:29,310","01:22:32,690","I'm sorry about the other night, Mike."
"01:22:32,780","01:22:36,860","I've got to frisk you, so turn around. On your knees, facing me."
"01:22:41,990","01:22:46,670",I guess I'm getting too old for my job. Too grouchy.
"01:22:48,080","01:22:51,920",Can't stand the aggravation. You know how it is.
"01:22:54,210","01:22:55,630",He's clean.
"01:23:22,240","01:23:24,540",Going to Jersey?
"01:23:27,040","01:23:28,580",Maybe.
"01:23:53,860","01:23:55,650","Nice work, Lou."
"01:24:32,810","01:24:38,360",- How's the food in this restaurant? - Try the veal. It's the best in the city.
"01:24:38,440","01:24:40,110",I'll have it.
"01:25:15,690","01:25:18,860",- I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey. - Go ahead.
"01:26:38,480","01:26:40,150",What I want...
"01:26:41,110","01:26:43,280",What's most important to me
"01:26:46,030","01:26:50,240",is that I have a guarantee. No more attempts on my father's life.
"01:26:50,330","01:26:55,080",What guarantees can I give you? I'm the hunted one!
"01:26:55,160","01:26:58,710","I missed my chance. You think too much of me, kid."
"01:26:58,790","01:27:00,630",I'm not that clever.
"01:27:02,130","01:27:04,380",All I want is a truce.
"01:27:10,930","01:27:14,770",I have to go to the bathroom. Is it all right?
"01:27:16,140","01:27:18,650","When you got to go, you got to go."
"01:27:24,150","01:27:26,070",He's clean.
"01:27:26,150","01:27:28,240",Don't take too long.
"01:27:31,370","01:27:33,160",I've frisked a thousand punks.
"01:32:23,780","01:32:25,790","Okay, you take over."
"01:32:43,050","01:32:44,890","I love you, Grandpa."
"01:32:47,810","01:32:50,520","I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet."
"01:32:51,850","01:32:54,940","- Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa. - Okay."
"01:32:55,060","01:33:01,320",""" I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."""
"01:33:04,320","01:33:06,620",Go with your mother.
"01:33:06,700","01:33:08,830",Take them downstairs.
"01:33:14,960","01:33:17,000","Go on, Carlo, you too."
"01:33:18,710","01:33:20,420",Go on.
"01:33:41,030","01:33:45,030","- What's the matter with you, Carlo? - Shut up and set the table."
"01:34:00,590","01:34:06,640","Since McCluskey's killing, the police have cracked down on our operations."
"01:34:08,390","01:34:13,270",And also the other families. There's been a lot of bad blood.
"01:34:13,350","01:34:16,850","They hit us, so we hit them back."
"01:34:17,690","01:34:22,230",Through our newspaper contacts we've been able to put out material
"01:34:22,320","01:34:26,610",about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo in the drug rackets.
"01:34:26,700","01:34:28,820",So things are loosening up.
"01:34:30,080","01:34:34,830","And I'm sending Fredo to Las Vegas,"
"01:34:34,910","01:34:37,460",under the protection of Don Francesco of L.A.
"01:34:37,580","01:34:42,090",- I want him to rest. - I'm going to learn the casino business.
"01:34:50,430","01:34:52,220",Where's Michael?
"01:35:04,530","01:35:07,660",It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.
"01:35:09,450","01:35:13,290",But he's safe. We're starting to work to bring him back.
"01:35:34,680","01:35:37,060",I want you to find out where that old pimp Tattaglia is hiding.
"01:35:37,140","01:35:39,100",I want him now.
"01:35:39,190","01:35:42,730","Sonny, things are starting to loosen up."
"01:35:42,820","01:35:47,530","If you go after Tattaglia, all hell will break loose. Pop can negotiate."
"01:35:47,610","01:35:53,620",- He must get better first. I'll decide... - War is costly. We can't do business.
"01:35:53,700","01:35:57,540",- Neither can they. Don't worry about it! - We can't afford a stalemate.
"01:35:57,660","01:36:02,590",- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard! - You're getting a great reputation!
"01:36:02,710","01:36:08,760","Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime consigliere, I wouldn't be in this shape!"
"01:36:08,840","01:36:11,140",Pop had Genco. Look what I got.
"01:36:14,720","01:36:17,020",I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
"01:36:18,180","01:36:21,150",Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.
"01:36:22,060","01:36:26,440",Niggers are having a good time with our policy banks in Harlem.
"01:36:26,530","01:36:30,700","Driving new Cadillacs, paying 50% on a bet."
"01:36:30,780","01:36:34,120",That's because they've started making big money.
"01:36:34,200","01:36:37,500",Papa never talked business at the table.
"01:36:37,580","01:36:41,460","- Shut up, Connie... - Don't you ever tell her to shut up."
"01:36:42,210","01:36:43,290",Don't interfere.
"01:36:45,590","01:36:49,510",I'd like to talk to you after dinner. I could do more for the family...
"01:36:49,590","01:36:52,380",We don't discuss business at the table.
"01:37:39,600","01:37:42,230","I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino."
"01:37:47,770","01:37:49,780",Why are you so far from the house?
"01:37:50,440","01:37:53,110",You know I'm responsible to your father for your life.
"01:37:53,200","01:37:54,490",The bodyguards are here.
"01:37:55,410","01:37:56,740",It's still dangerous...
"01:37:57,870","01:37:59,620",We've heard from Santino in New York...
"01:38:01,040","01:38:03,290",Your enemies know you're here.
"01:38:05,290","01:38:07,040",Did Santino say when I can go back?
"01:38:07,710","01:38:09,000",Not yet.
"01:38:09,670","01:38:11,510",It's out of the question.
"01:38:14,970","01:38:16,390",Where are you going now?
"01:38:18,050","01:38:19,100",To Corleone.
"01:38:19,720","01:38:20,970",Take my car.
"01:38:24,310","01:38:25,350",I want to walk.
"01:38:27,980","01:38:29,150",Be careful.
"01:39:03,680","01:39:05,060",Where have all the men gone?
"01:39:06,100","01:39:08,310",They're all dead from vendettas.
"01:39:09,940","01:39:12,360",There are the names of the dead.
"01:39:28,750","01:39:32,880","Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!"
"01:39:32,960","01:39:37,260","Hey, hey, take me to the America, G. I.! Clark Gable!"
"01:39:37,380","01:39:42,640","America! Take me to the America, G. I.! Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!"
"01:40:00,570","01:40:02,620",Mamma Mia what a beauty.
"01:40:10,790","01:40:13,880",I think you got hit by the thunderbolt.
"01:40:20,090","01:40:24,100",In Sicily women are more dangerous than shotguns.
"01:40:46,790","01:40:48,950",Did you have a good hunt?
"01:40:49,910","01:40:52,290",You know all the girls around here?
"01:40:52,790","01:40:54,290",We saw some real beauties.
"01:40:55,130","01:40:58,630",One of them struck our friend like a thunderbolt.
"01:41:01,840","01:41:04,600",She would tempt the devil himself.
"01:41:12,230","01:41:14,400",Really put together.
"01:41:14,480","01:41:15,520","Right, Calo?"
"01:41:19,280","01:41:21,280","Such hair, such mouth!"
"01:41:23,660","01:41:26,830",The girls around here are beautiful... but virtuous.
"01:41:27,370","01:41:29,750",This one had a purple dress...
"01:41:30,120","01:41:32,250",And a purple ribbon in her hair.
"01:41:33,120","01:41:36,290",A type more Greek than Italian.
"01:41:38,710","01:41:40,550",Do you know her?
"01:41:44,970","01:41:47,760",There's no girl like that in this town.
"01:41:50,470","01:41:51,680","My God, I understand!"
"01:41:55,810","01:41:56,810",What's wrong?
"01:41:59,020","01:42:00,400",Let's go.
"01:42:02,360","01:42:03,610",It's his daughter.
"01:42:04,070","01:42:05,570",Tell him to come here.
"01:42:08,990","01:42:10,330",Call him.
"01:42:30,390","01:42:32,720","Fabrizio, you translate."
"01:42:36,850","01:42:38,730",I apologize if I offended you.
"01:42:39,730","01:42:43,150",I'm a stranger in this country.
"01:42:43,240","01:42:46,320",I meant no disrespect to you or your daughter.
"01:42:51,790","01:42:54,660","I'm an American, hiding in Sicily."
"01:42:56,080","01:42:58,420",My name is Michael Corleone.
"01:43:00,460","01:43:04,590",There are people who'd pay a lot of money for that information.
"01:43:06,760","01:43:09,800",But then your daughter would lose a father
"01:43:11,390","01:43:13,770",instead of gaining a husband.
"01:43:21,940","01:43:24,150",I want to meet your daughter.
"01:43:24,820","01:43:29,410","With your permission, and under the supervision of your family."
"01:43:30,070","01:43:31,740",With all respect.
"01:43:37,790","01:43:41,790",Come to my house Sunday morning. My name is Vitelli.
"01:43:47,300","01:43:48,800",What's her name?
"01:46:44,140","01:46:46,310",I'll knock you dizzy.
"01:46:52,070","01:46:54,150",Save it for the library.
"01:46:57,820","01:47:00,490",We've got to pick up my sister.
"01:47:18,550","01:47:20,260",What's the matter?
"01:47:22,720","01:47:24,520",What's the matter?
"01:47:26,310","01:47:28,230",- It was my fault! - Where is he?
"01:47:28,310","01:47:31,480",It was my fault. I hit him.
"01:47:31,570","01:47:35,360","I started a fight with him. I hit him, so he hit me..."
"01:47:40,570","01:47:43,870",I'm just going to get a doctor to take a look at you.
"01:47:43,950","01:47:46,460","Sonny, please don't do anything."
"01:47:48,420","01:47:50,500",What's the matter with you? What am I going to do?
"01:47:50,580","01:47:53,460",Make that baby an orphan before he's born?
"01:47:58,010","01:48:01,220",You spic slobs still betting Yankees?
"01:48:01,300","01:48:03,970",Tell them to stop taking in action.
"01:48:04,810","01:48:06,520",We lost enough money last week.
"01:48:13,650","01:48:15,690","Come here, come here!"
"01:49:12,620","01:49:15,960","If you touch my sister again, I'll kill you."
"01:53:09,190","01:53:13,450","Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay. You should call."
"01:53:13,530","01:53:17,870","Yes, I have. I've tried writing and calling."
"01:53:17,950","01:53:21,790",- I want to reach Michael. - Nobody knows where he is.
"01:53:21,870","01:53:24,420",All we know is that he's all right.
"01:53:26,960","01:53:30,590","- What was that? - An accident, but nobody was hurt."
"01:53:31,720","01:53:35,850","Tom, will you give this letter to Michael. Please?"
"01:53:37,390","01:53:42,560","If I accepted that, a court could prove I have knowledge of his whereabouts."
"01:53:43,560","01:53:45,440",He'll get in touch with you.
"01:53:45,560","01:53:49,230","I let my cab go, so can I call another one, please?"
"01:53:49,320","01:53:51,190",Come on. Sorry.
"01:54:08,420","01:54:13,090",- Hello? - Is Carlo there?
"01:54:13,880","01:54:16,340",- Who is this? - A friend of Carlo.
"01:54:16,430","01:54:19,810",Tell him that I can't make it tonight until later.
"01:54:25,560","01:54:26,810",Bitch!
"01:54:28,820","01:54:31,610",- Dinner's on the table. - I'm not hungry.
"01:54:31,690","01:54:35,030",- The food is getting cold. - I'll eat out later.
"01:54:35,110","01:54:38,490",- You just told me to make you dinner! - Vafangool!
"01:54:38,700","01:54:40,830",I'll vafangool you!
"01:54:45,670","01:54:48,460","She has a filthy mouth, this Guinea brat."
"01:54:52,800","01:54:57,140","That's it, break it all, you spoiled Guinea brat. Break it all!"
"01:55:06,350","01:55:09,480",Why don't you bring your whore home for dinner?
"01:55:10,480","01:55:12,150",Maybe I will.
"01:55:18,910","01:55:22,080",- Clean it up! - Like hell I will!
"01:55:22,160","01:55:26,080","You skinny, spoiled brat. Clean it up! Clean it up!"
"01:55:26,160","01:55:30,670","Clean it up! I said, clean it up! Clean it up!"
"01:55:30,750","01:55:35,590","Clean it up. Clean that up, you..."
"01:55:38,840","01:55:40,550",Clean it!
"01:55:40,640","01:55:44,890","Clean it up! Yeah, kill me. Be a murderer, like your father!"
"01:55:44,970","01:55:48,440",- All you Corleones are murderers! - I hate you!
"01:55:48,520","01:55:50,230","Come on, kill me!"
"01:55:51,770","01:55:53,440",Get out of here!
"01:55:53,520","01:55:56,950",- I hate you! - Now I'll kill you.
"01:55:57,030","01:55:59,700",You Guinea brat. Get out of here!
"01:56:10,170","01:56:13,130","Connie, what's the matter? I can't hear you."
"01:56:14,250","01:56:17,300","Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying."
"01:56:17,380","01:56:20,300","Santino, I can't understand. I don't know."
"01:56:21,590","01:56:23,390","Yeah, Connie."
"01:56:28,060","01:56:30,020",You wait there.
"01:56:32,650","01:56:35,190","No, you just wait there."
"01:56:37,360","01:56:39,610",Son-of-a-bitch.
"01:56:39,700","01:56:42,910",- Son-of-a-bitch! - What's the matter?
"01:56:47,080","01:56:50,160",Open the goddamn gate! Get off your ass.
"01:56:58,170","01:56:59,420",Sonny!
"01:57:05,890","01:57:07,890",- Sonny. - Get out of here!
"01:57:08,980","01:57:10,850","Go after him, go on!"
"01:57:40,590","01:57:42,630",Son-of-a-bitch. Come on!
"01:59:31,330","01:59:33,160",Give me a drop.
"01:59:41,590","01:59:43,880",My wife is crying upstairs.
"01:59:46,260","01:59:48,760",I hear cars coming to the house.
"01:59:53,430","01:59:56,350","Consigliere of mine,"
"01:59:56,430","01:59:59,940",tell your Don what everyone seems to know.
"02:00:00,020","02:00:02,400",I didn't tell Mama anything.
"02:00:03,360","02:00:06,610",I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.
"02:00:10,110","02:00:12,330",But you needed a drink first.
"02:00:14,660","02:00:15,910",Yeah.
"02:00:19,210","02:00:21,710","Well, now you've had your drink."
"02:00:27,260","02:00:31,140",They shot Sonny on the causeway. He's dead.
"02:00:48,190","02:00:50,740",I want no inquiries made.
"02:00:55,200","02:00:57,750",I want no acts of vengeance.
"02:00:59,460","02:01:02,290",I want you to arrange a meeting
"02:01:03,290","02:01:05,920",with the heads of the five families.
"02:01:07,840","02:01:09,920",This war stops now.
"02:01:31,860","02:01:34,410",Call Bonasera.
"02:01:34,490","02:01:36,660",I need him now.
"02:01:49,050","02:01:54,220","This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for Vito Corleone, at his request."
"02:01:54,300","02:01:56,680",You owe your Don a service.
"02:01:56,760","02:02:00,310",He has no doubt that you will repay it.
"02:02:00,390","02:02:02,560",He will be at your funeral parlor in one hour.
"02:02:02,561","02:02:04,730",Be there to greet him.
"02:02:25,920","02:02:30,710","Well, my friend, are you ready to do me this service?"
"02:02:30,800","02:02:33,880",Yes. What do you want me to do?
"02:02:42,270","02:02:46,730",I want you to use all your powers and all your skills.
"02:02:50,900","02:02:53,820",I don't want his mother to see him this way.
"02:03:09,840","02:03:12,960",Look how they massacred my boy.
"02:03:41,990","02:03:45,250",It's safer to teach you English!
"02:03:46,000","02:03:47,420",I know English...
"02:03:47,500","02:03:52,290","Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday."
"02:03:59,510","02:04:01,300","Greetings, Don Tommasino."
"02:04:02,010","02:04:04,010",How are things in Palermo?
"02:04:10,020","02:04:14,070","Michael is teaching me to drive... watch, I'll show you."
"02:04:16,860","02:04:18,700",How are things in Palermo?
"02:04:19,070","02:04:22,200",Young people don't respect anything anymore...
"02:04:23,280","02:04:26,660",times are changing for the worse.
"02:04:28,910","02:04:32,330",This place has become too dangerous for you.
"02:04:35,050","02:04:40,220",I want you to move to a villa near Siracusa... right now.
"02:04:46,220","02:04:47,390",What's wrong?
"02:04:48,520","02:04:50,730",Bad news from America.
"02:04:53,190","02:04:56,900","Your brother, Santino, they killed him."
"02:05:03,490","02:05:05,330",Let's go... you promised.
"02:05:24,140","02:05:25,140",Fabrizio!
"02:05:25,220","02:05:26,640",Get the car.
"02:05:28,020","02:05:32,190","Are you driving yourself, Boss? Is your wife coming with you?"
"02:05:32,270","02:05:35,860","No, take her to her father's house until things are safe."
"02:05:35,940","02:05:37,860","Okay, anything you say."
"02:05:43,780","02:05:45,530","Calo, where is Apollonia?"
"02:05:46,280","02:05:49,790",She's going to surprise you. She wants to drive.
"02:05:52,080","02:05:54,120",She'll make a good American wife.
"02:05:55,580","02:05:58,130","Wait, I'll get the baggage."
"02:06:08,390","02:06:10,560",Fabrizio!
"02:06:10,640","02:06:12,310",Where are you going?
"02:06:14,020","02:06:16,440",Wait there! I'll drive to you.
"02:06:22,570","02:06:23,990","No, Apollonia!"
"02:06:47,050","02:06:52,890","Don Barzini, I want to thank you for helping me organize this meeting,"
"02:06:53,020","02:06:57,860",and the other heads of the five families from New York and New Jersey.
"02:06:59,610","02:07:02,740","Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,"
"02:07:02,820","02:07:06,160",and from Brooklyn
"02:07:07,780","02:07:09,870",Philip Tattaglia.
"02:07:11,660","02:07:14,370",And from Staten Island
"02:07:14,460","02:07:17,960",we have with us Victor Strachi.
"02:07:18,040","02:07:23,670",And the other associates that came as far as from California and Kansas City
"02:07:23,760","02:07:27,510",and all the other territories of the country. Thank you.
"02:07:34,350","02:07:37,810",How did things ever get so far?
"02:07:37,900","02:07:39,520",I don't know.
"02:07:41,570","02:07:45,070","It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary."
"02:07:48,200","02:07:51,620","Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son."
"02:07:54,080","02:07:57,500","We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,"
"02:07:57,580","02:08:01,590",then I'm willing to let things go on as before.
"02:08:03,050","02:08:06,670",We're grateful to Don Corleone for calling this meeting.
"02:08:06,760","02:08:12,140",We all know him as a man of his word. A modest man who listens to reason.
"02:08:12,220","02:08:16,310","Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest."
"02:08:16,390","02:08:20,600",He had all the judges and politicians in his pocket.
"02:08:20,690","02:08:23,570",He refused to share them.
"02:08:23,650","02:08:27,440",When did I ever refuse an accommodation?
"02:08:27,530","02:08:29,910",All of you know me.
"02:08:30,820","02:08:35,990","When did I ever refuse, except one time? And why?"
"02:08:37,660","02:08:43,500",Because I believe this drug business will destroy us in the years to come.
"02:08:43,590","02:08:47,840","It's not like gambling or liquor or even women,"
"02:08:47,920","02:08:53,890","which is something that most people want, but is forbidden by the Church."
"02:08:54,010","02:08:58,730",Even the police that have helped us in the past with gambling and other things
"02:08:58,810","02:09:03,020",are going to refuse to help us when it comes to narcotics.
"02:09:03,110","02:09:08,240",I believed that then and I believe that now.
"02:09:08,320","02:09:10,530",Times have changed.
"02:09:10,650","02:09:15,370","It's not like the old days, when we could do anything we wanted."
"02:09:15,450","02:09:18,330",A refusal is not the act of a friend.
"02:09:18,410","02:09:23,830","If Don Corleone had all the judges and politicians, then he must share them"
"02:09:23,920","02:09:28,510",or let others use them. He must let us draw the water from the well.
"02:09:29,590","02:09:33,180",Certainly he can present a bill for such services.
"02:09:33,260","02:09:35,850","After all, we're not communists."
"02:09:38,970","02:09:42,060",I also don't believe in drugs.
"02:09:42,190","02:09:47,020","For years I paid my people extra, so they wouldn't do that kind of business."
"02:09:47,110","02:09:50,240","Somebody says to them "" I have powders."""
"02:09:50,320","02:09:53,570",""" If you put up 3-4,000 dollar investment,"
"02:09:53,860","02:09:56,660","we can make 50,000 distributing."""
"02:09:57,870","02:10:03,790","They can't resist. I want to control it as a business, keep it respectable."
"02:10:03,870","02:10:08,670","I don't want it near schools, I don't want it sold to children."
"02:10:08,750","02:10:10,550",Thats an infàmia.
"02:10:11,880","02:10:15,800",In my city we would keep the traffic to the colored.
"02:10:15,890","02:10:19,100","They're animals, so let them lose their souls."
"02:10:25,730","02:10:29,320",I hoped that we could come here and reason together.
"02:10:30,730","02:10:37,370",And I'm willing to do whatever is necessary to find a peaceful solution.
"02:10:37,910","02:10:42,500","We are agreed. The traffic in drugs will be permitted, but controlled."
"02:10:42,580","02:10:46,880","Don Corleone will give us protection in the east, and there will be peace."
"02:10:46,960","02:10:50,710",I must have strict assurance from Corleone.
"02:10:50,800","02:10:54,090","As time goes by and his position becomes stronger,"
"02:10:54,170","02:10:56,840",will he attempt any individual vendetta?
"02:10:56,930","02:11:02,060",We are all reasonable men. We don't have to give assurances.
"02:11:02,140","02:11:05,020",You talk about vengeance.
"02:11:05,100","02:11:08,360",Will vengeance bring your son back to you?
"02:11:08,440","02:11:10,980",Or my boy to me?
"02:11:11,070","02:11:13,860",I forgo the vengeance of my son.
"02:11:16,660","02:11:18,950",But I have selfish reasons.
"02:11:21,240","02:11:24,830",My youngest son was forced to leave this country
"02:11:26,710","02:11:29,250",because of this Sollozzo business.
"02:11:30,790","02:11:34,720",And I have to make arrangements to bring him back here safely.
"02:11:34,800","02:11:37,470",Cleared of all these false charges.
"02:11:38,890","02:11:42,010",But I'm a superstitious man.
"02:11:42,140","02:11:47,440","If an unlucky accident should befall him, if he should be shot by a police officer,"
"02:11:48,810","02:11:52,400","or if he should hang himself in his jail cell,"
"02:11:52,480","02:11:55,360","or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,"
"02:11:56,650","02:12:00,240",then I'm going to blame some of the people in this room.
"02:12:01,910","02:12:04,240",And that I do not forgive.
"02:12:06,710","02:12:09,080","But, that aside"
"02:12:12,170","02:12:14,500",let me say that I swear
"02:12:16,130","02:12:19,260","on the souls of my grandchildren,"
"02:12:19,340","02:12:23,720",that I will not be the one to break the peace we've made here today.
"02:12:49,210","02:12:54,670",Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's drug middlemen have clean records?
"02:12:54,750","02:12:56,880",Mention it. Don't insist.
"02:12:58,880","02:13:03,800",- Barzini will know without being told. - You mean Tattaglia.
"02:13:05,430","02:13:07,390",Tattaglia's a pimp.
"02:13:08,480","02:13:11,600",He could never have outfought Santino.
"02:13:13,980","02:13:19,570",But I didn't know until this day that it was Barzini all along.
"02:13:35,040","02:13:37,130","Come on, Nancy."
"02:13:38,340","02:13:40,920","Keep together, everyone. Brian."
"02:13:42,260","02:13:43,930","Okay, all right."
"02:13:57,020","02:13:59,230",How long have you been back?
"02:14:00,030","02:14:01,860",I've been back a year.
"02:14:03,280","02:14:05,410","Longer than that, I think."
"02:14:08,240","02:14:10,410","It's good to see you, Kay."
"02:14:21,470","02:14:24,010","I'm working for my father now, Kay."
"02:14:26,510","02:14:29,510",He's been sick. Very sick.
"02:14:31,060","02:14:33,020",But you're not like him.
"02:14:33,100","02:14:36,900",You told me you weren't going to become like your father.
"02:14:38,820","02:14:43,110",My father is no different than any other powerful man.
"02:14:43,200","02:14:46,660",Any man who's responsible for other people.
"02:14:47,870","02:14:50,290",Like a senator or president.
"02:14:50,370","02:14:52,830",- How naive you sound. - Why?
"02:14:52,910","02:14:55,750",They don't have men killed.
"02:14:59,170","02:15:01,170","Who's being naive, Kay?"
"02:15:02,420","02:15:06,680",My father's way of doing things is over. Even he knows that.
"02:15:08,220","02:15:12,600",In five years the Corleone family is going to be completely legitimate.
"02:15:14,430","02:15:18,400",Trust me. That's all I can tell you about my business. Kay...
"02:15:19,860","02:15:22,980","Michael, why did you come here? Why?"
"02:15:24,280","02:15:26,700",What do you want with me after all this time?
"02:15:26,701","02:15:29,120",I've been calling and writing.
"02:15:29,200","02:15:32,700",I came because I need you. I care for you.
"02:15:32,790","02:15:36,620","- Please stop it, Michael. - Because... I want you to marry me."
"02:15:38,330","02:15:40,920","- It's too late. - Please, Kay..."
"02:15:42,670","02:15:46,550",I'll do anything you ask to make up for what's happened to us.
"02:15:48,220","02:15:52,470","Because that's important, Kay. Because what's important is that"
"02:15:54,020","02:15:57,270",we have each other. That we have a life together.
"02:15:58,850","02:16:01,570",That we have children. Our children.
"02:16:03,070","02:16:05,240","Kay, I need you."
"02:16:07,200","02:16:08,780",And I love you.
"02:16:30,930","02:16:34,680",Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it!
"02:16:34,810","02:16:38,440",- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat! - Be patient.
"02:16:38,520","02:16:41,650",I'm not asking for help. Just take off the handcuffs.
"02:16:41,730","02:16:44,860",- Be patient. - We must protect ourselves.
"02:16:44,940","02:16:48,400",- Let me recruit some new men. - No.
"02:16:48,490","02:16:52,370","- Barzini would get an excuse to fight. - Mike, you're wrong."
"02:16:53,870","02:16:56,040",Don Corleone...
"02:16:56,120","02:17:00,250",You once said that one day Tessio and me could form our own family.
"02:17:00,330","02:17:04,380",Till today I would never think of it. I must ask your permission.
"02:17:05,380","02:17:08,050",Michael is now head of the family.
"02:17:08,130","02:17:12,430","If he gives his permission, then you have my blessing."
"02:17:12,510","02:17:14,890",After we make the move to Nevada
"02:17:14,970","02:17:19,390",you can leave the Corleone family and go on your own.
"02:17:19,480","02:17:23,810",- How long will that be? - Six months.
"02:17:23,900","02:17:27,150","Forgive me, but with you gone,"
"02:17:27,230","02:17:30,070",me and Pete will come under Barzini's thumb.
"02:17:30,150","02:17:35,830",I hate that Barzini. In six months' time there will be nothing left to build on.
"02:17:35,910","02:17:38,830",- Do you have faith in my judgment? - Yes.
"02:17:38,910","02:17:41,830","- Do I have your loyalty? - Always, Godfather."
"02:17:41,920","02:17:45,170",Then be a friend to Michael. Do as he says.
"02:17:50,090","02:17:55,430",Things are negotiated that'll solve your problems and answer your questions.
"02:17:55,510","02:17:57,850",That's all I can tell you now.
"02:17:58,680","02:18:01,270","Carlo, you grew up in Nevada."
"02:18:01,350","02:18:04,730","When we make our move there, you'll be my right-hand man."
"02:18:04,810","02:18:09,610",Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere. He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.
"02:18:09,690","02:18:12,240","That's no reflection on Tom, just how I want it."
"02:18:12,320","02:18:17,030","If I ever need help, who's a better consigliere than my father? That's it."
"02:18:37,050","02:18:40,890","- Thank you, Papa. - I'm happy for you, Carlo."
"02:18:40,970","02:18:43,890",Mike... Why am I out?
"02:18:45,400","02:18:48,110","You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom."
"02:18:49,400","02:18:52,650",Things may get rough with the move.
"02:18:52,740","02:18:54,030",Tom.
"02:18:59,200","02:19:04,370",I advised Michael. I never thought you were a bad consigliere.
"02:19:04,460","02:19:08,590","I thought Santino was a bad Don, rest in peace."
"02:19:10,050","02:19:13,260","Michael has all my confidence, just as you do."
"02:19:14,260","02:19:19,220",But there are reasons why you must have no part in what is going to happen.
"02:19:20,260","02:19:23,310","- Maybe I could help. - You're out, Tom."
"02:20:12,480","02:20:16,780",I can't get over the way your face looks. So good!
"02:20:16,900","02:20:21,490","This doctor did some job. Did Kay talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!"
"02:20:21,570","02:20:25,700",Leave them out here. He's tired and wants to clean up.
"02:20:25,790","02:20:28,160","Let me open the door, all right?"
"02:20:34,340","02:20:39,760","- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas! - All for you, kid! It's all his idea."
"02:20:39,840","02:20:42,470",- Your brother Freddy. - Girls?
"02:20:46,390","02:20:49,480",I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.
"02:20:50,690","02:20:54,190","- Anything you want, kid, anything. - Who are the girls?"
"02:20:55,610","02:20:59,030","- That's for you to find out. - Get rid of them, Fredo."
"02:21:00,570","02:21:05,240","- Hey, Mike... - I'm here on business. Get rid of them."
"02:21:05,330","02:21:08,000",I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.
"02:21:13,880","02:21:17,170","Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go."
"02:21:17,260","02:21:19,380","Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo."
"02:21:21,090","02:21:23,220","Hey, come on! Scram!"
"02:21:24,890","02:21:28,430","Come on, honey. I don't know what's the matter with him, Johnny."
"02:21:28,520","02:21:29,810",Sorry.
"02:21:31,770","02:21:34,310",I don't know. He's tired.
"02:21:41,320","02:21:44,410",What happened to Moe Greene?
"02:21:44,490","02:21:48,830",He had some business. He said to give him a call when the party started.
"02:21:48,910","02:21:50,870","Well, give him a call."
"02:21:52,250","02:21:55,380","- Johnny, how are you? - Nice to see you, Mike."
"02:21:55,460","02:21:57,670",- We're proud of you. - Thanks.
"02:21:57,750","02:22:01,340","Sit down, I want to talk to you. The Don is proud too."
"02:22:01,420","02:22:03,680","Well, I owe it all to him."
"02:22:04,890","02:22:06,470",He knows how grateful you are.
"02:22:06,550","02:22:09,810",That's why he'd like to ask a favor of you.
"02:22:09,890","02:22:11,810","Mike, what can I do?"
"02:22:12,980","02:22:15,440",We're thinking of giving up our interests
"02:22:15,520","02:22:18,440",in the olive oil business and settling here.
"02:22:19,280","02:22:24,610","Moe will sell us his share of the casino and the hotel, so we'll own all of it."
"02:22:24,700","02:22:27,450",- Tom! - Are you sure?
"02:22:27,530","02:22:30,540",Moe loves the business. He never said nothing about selling.
"02:22:30,620","02:22:33,330",I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
"02:22:34,620","02:22:37,040","See, Johnny..."
"02:22:37,130","02:22:41,340",We figure that entertainment would draw gamblers to the casino.
"02:22:41,420","02:22:45,180",We hope you'll sign a contract to appear five times a year.
"02:22:48,100","02:22:52,730",Perhaps convince some of your friends in the movies to do the same.
"02:22:53,980","02:22:56,100",We're counting on you.
"02:22:58,110","02:23:01,780","Sure, Mike. I'll do anything for my godfather."
"02:23:01,860","02:23:03,150",Good.
"02:23:04,780","02:23:09,410","Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows. Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom."
"02:23:09,490","02:23:12,040","- Good to see you. - How are you, Moe?"
"02:23:12,160","02:23:17,250","Have everything? Specially prepared food, the best dancers, and good credit."
"02:23:17,330","02:23:20,920","Draw chips for everybody, so they can play on the house."
"02:23:23,590","02:23:26,340",Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
"02:23:28,090","02:23:29,930",Buy me out?
"02:23:30,010","02:23:32,600","The casino, the hotel."
"02:23:32,680","02:23:35,600",The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
"02:23:35,690","02:23:41,110","The Corleone family wants to buy me out? No, I buy you out."
"02:23:41,190","02:23:44,610",Your casino loses money. We can do better.
"02:23:44,690","02:23:48,570",- You think I'm skimming off the top? - You're unlucky.
"02:23:53,370","02:23:55,790",You Guineas make me laugh.
"02:23:55,910","02:24:00,500","I took Freddy in when you had a bad time, and now you try to push me out!"
"02:24:01,880","02:24:05,300",You did that because we bankrolled your casino
"02:24:05,380","02:24:08,010",and the Molinari family guaranteed his safety.
"02:24:08,011","02:24:10,640",Let's talk business.
"02:24:10,720","02:24:13,470","Yes. First of all, you're all done."
"02:24:13,560","02:24:16,020",You don't have that kind of muscle anymore.
"02:24:16,140","02:24:20,520",The Godfather is sick. You're getting chased out of New York by the others.
"02:24:20,610","02:24:24,530",Do you think you can come to my hotel and take over?
"02:24:24,610","02:24:29,660",I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal with him and still keep my hotel!
"02:24:29,740","02:24:33,240",Is that why you slapped my brother around in public?
"02:24:33,330","02:24:38,160","That was nothing, Mike. Moe didn't mean nothing by that."
"02:24:38,250","02:24:42,460","He flies off the handle sometimes, but we're good friends."
"02:24:42,540","02:24:47,300",I have a business to run. I've got to kick asses sometimes.
"02:24:47,380","02:24:51,260","We had an argument, so I had to straighten him out."
"02:24:51,340","02:24:54,180",You straightened my brother out?
"02:24:54,260","02:24:58,730",He was banging cocktail waitresses! Players couldn't get a drink.
"02:24:58,810","02:25:00,770",What's wrong with you?
"02:25:05,650","02:25:08,780",I leave for New York tomorrow. Think about a price.
"02:25:09,700","02:25:11,320",Son-of-a-bitch!
"02:25:11,410","02:25:16,580",I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones when you were out with cheerleaders.
"02:25:16,660","02:25:19,160","Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea."
"02:25:20,290","02:25:23,840","Tom, you're the consigliere. Talk to the Don..."
"02:25:23,960","02:25:29,340",Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and Mike is in charge of the family business.
"02:25:29,420","02:25:32,760","If you have anything to say, say it to Michael."
"02:25:37,640","02:25:42,480","Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!"
"02:25:43,230","02:25:44,440",Fredo...
"02:25:45,650","02:25:48,400","You're my older brother, and I love you."
"02:25:49,860","02:25:53,870",But don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again.
"02:25:55,370","02:25:56,370",Ever.
"02:26:04,500","02:26:08,670","I have to see my father and his people, so have dinner without me."
"02:26:10,420","02:26:15,300","This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to the city, see a show and have dinner."
"02:26:22,690","02:26:25,730",Your sister wants to ask you something.
"02:26:25,810","02:26:27,940",- Let her ask. - She's afraid to.
"02:26:28,020","02:26:30,990",They want you to be godfather to their boy.
"02:26:31,070","02:26:32,900",- We'll see. - Will you?
"02:26:32,990","02:26:35,320",Let me think about it. Come on.
"02:26:44,210","02:26:47,080",Barzini will move against you first.
"02:26:47,170","02:26:51,590",He'll set up a meeting with someone you absolutely trust.
"02:26:51,670","02:26:53,720",Guaranteeing your safety.
"02:26:54,970","02:26:58,050",And at that meeting you'll be assassinated.
"02:27:02,770","02:27:05,770",I like to drink wine more than I used to.
"02:27:07,190","02:27:10,690","- Anyway, I'm drinking more. - It's good for you, Pop."
"02:27:15,740","02:27:17,240",I don't know.
"02:27:19,280","02:27:22,200",Are you happy with your wife and children?
"02:27:23,160","02:27:26,000",- Very happy. - That's good.
"02:27:27,880","02:27:32,760",I hope you don't mind the way I keep going over this Barzini business.
"02:27:32,840","02:27:35,800","- No, not at all. - It's an old habit."
"02:27:37,260","02:27:40,260",I spend my life trying not to be careless.
"02:27:41,810","02:27:45,270","Women and children can be careless, but not men."
"02:27:48,600","02:27:50,940",- How's your boy? - He's good.
"02:27:51,070","02:27:53,780",He looks more like you every day.
"02:27:56,490","02:28:00,950",He's smarter than I am. He's three and can read the funny papers.
"02:28:03,080","02:28:05,120",Read the funny papers.
"02:28:12,340","02:28:17,970",I want you to arrange for a telephone man to check all in-and out-going calls.
"02:28:18,090","02:28:20,740","I did it already. I took care of that, Pop."
"02:28:20,741","02:28:23,390",That's right. I forgot.
"02:28:27,440","02:28:29,150",What's the matter?
"02:28:29,980","02:28:32,020",What's bothering you?
"02:28:35,610","02:28:40,240","I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it, so I'll handle it."
"02:28:53,500","02:28:58,010",I knew that Santino would have to go through all this.
"02:28:58,090","02:28:59,720",And Fredo...
"02:29:02,430","02:29:04,470","Fredo was, well..."
"02:29:06,350","02:29:09,190",But I never wanted this for you.
"02:29:11,520","02:29:16,570",I worked my whole life. I don't apologize for taking care of my family.
"02:29:16,650","02:29:20,570","And I refused to be a fool,"
"02:29:20,660","02:29:24,780",dancing on a string held by all those big shots.
"02:29:26,740","02:29:30,210","I don't apologize. That's my life, but I thought that,"
"02:29:31,870","02:29:37,050","that when it was your time, you would be the one to hold the strings."
"02:29:38,840","02:29:44,510",Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone. Something.
"02:29:44,600","02:29:47,600",Another pezzonovante.
"02:29:47,680","02:29:49,350",Well...
"02:29:52,560","02:29:56,480","Just wasn't enough time, Michael. Wasn't enough time."
"02:29:56,570","02:30:00,070","We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there."
"02:30:04,910","02:30:09,370","Now listen, whoever comes to you with this Barzini meeting,"
"02:30:09,450","02:30:12,420",he's the traitor. Don't forget that.
"02:30:29,390","02:30:31,520","Can I hold it, please?"
"02:30:46,620","02:30:50,490","- Can I water these? - Yes, go ahead."
"02:30:50,580","02:30:53,370","Over here, over here."
"02:30:55,250","02:30:57,750",Be careful. You're spilling it.
"02:31:04,130","02:31:05,890",Anthony!
"02:31:05,970","02:31:07,640","Come here, come here."
"02:31:12,810","02:31:15,480",That's it. We'll put it right there.
"02:31:20,690","02:31:23,280",I'll show you something. Come here.
"02:31:25,320","02:31:27,200",Stand there.
"02:31:30,950","02:31:32,700",Give me an orange!
"02:31:51,060","02:31:52,850",That's a new trick.
"02:31:53,850","02:31:56,190",You run in there. Run in there.
"02:32:09,740","02:32:11,700",Where are you?
"02:35:09,380","02:35:11,760","Mike, can I have a minute?"
"02:35:21,850","02:35:24,310",Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.
"02:35:24,390","02:35:27,690",He says we can straighten out any of our problems.
"02:35:28,360","02:35:30,570",- You talked to him? - Yeah.
"02:35:31,900","02:35:35,700",I can arrange security. On my territory.
"02:35:38,740","02:35:41,290",- All right? - All right.
"02:35:58,800","02:36:01,760",Do you know how they're going to come at you?
"02:36:04,270","02:36:07,940",They're arranging a meeting in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.
"02:36:10,110","02:36:11,900",Where I'll be safe.
"02:36:24,160","02:36:27,750","I always thought it would be Clemenza, not Tessio."
"02:36:27,830","02:36:31,630",It's the smart move. Tessio was always smarter.
"02:36:33,880","02:36:35,170",But I'm going to wait.
"02:36:35,840","02:36:36,840",After the baptism.
"02:36:40,720","02:36:44,310",I've decided to be godfather to Connie's baby.
"02:36:44,390","02:36:48,560",And then I'll meet with Don Barzini and Tattaglia.
"02:36:50,150","02:36:53,110",All the heads of the five families.
"02:39:14,080","02:39:19,040","Michael, do you believe in God, the Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?"
"02:39:19,130","02:39:20,300",I do.
"02:39:20,380","02:39:23,880","Do you believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord?"
"02:39:23,970","02:39:24,970",I do.
"02:39:25,050","02:39:29,100","Do you believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy Catholic Church?"
"02:39:29,180","02:39:30,470",I do.
"02:40:36,040","02:40:40,380","Michael Francis Rizzi, do you renounce Satan?"
"02:40:46,630","02:40:47,880",I do renounce him.
"02:40:57,560","02:40:58,980",And all his works?
"02:41:12,870","02:41:13,910",I do renounce them.
"02:41:15,660","02:41:16,910","Oh, God!"
"02:41:19,830","02:41:23,500",- And all his pomps? - I do renounce them.
"02:41:39,270","02:41:43,480","Michael Rizzi, will you be baptized?"
"02:41:43,560","02:41:44,770",I will.
"02:41:51,910","02:41:57,410","Michael Rizzi, go in peace, and may the Lord be with you. Amen."
"02:42:11,630","02:42:13,550",Kay!
"02:42:13,640","02:42:15,600",Kiss your godfather.
"02:42:40,000","02:42:44,080",Can't go to Vegas. Something's come up.
"02:42:44,170","02:42:45,830",Everybody has to leave without us.
"02:42:45,920","02:42:48,880","- Mike, it's our first vacation! - Connie, please."
"02:42:49,000","02:42:52,510","Go back to the house, wait for my call. It's important."
"02:42:53,630","02:42:56,010",I'll only be a couple of days.
"02:43:12,280","02:43:14,490",We're on our way to Brooklyn.
"02:43:16,660","02:43:20,410",- I hope Mike can get us a good deal. - I'm sure he will.
"02:43:28,210","02:43:33,630","Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a separate car, so you two go on ahead."
"02:43:33,720","02:43:37,260",- That screws up my arrangements. - That's what he said.
"02:43:37,340","02:43:39,510","I can't go either, Sal."
"02:43:51,480","02:43:55,400",Tell Mike it was only business. I always liked him.
"02:43:57,070","02:43:59,910","- He understands that. - Excuse me, Sal."
"02:44:05,910","02:44:08,380","Tom, can you get me off the hook?"
"02:44:09,540","02:44:12,710","- For old times' sake? - Can't do it, Sally."
"02:44:58,130","02:45:00,970","You have to answer for Santino, Carlo."
"02:45:05,850","02:45:09,770","- Mike, you got it all wrong. - You fingered Sonny for Barzini."
"02:45:10,810","02:45:14,730",That little farce you played with my sister.
"02:45:14,820","02:45:19,910",- You think that could fool a Corleone? - I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.
"02:45:19,990","02:45:22,700","- Please, don't do this. - Sit down."
"02:45:25,370","02:45:27,660","Don't do this to me, please."
"02:45:36,920","02:45:38,670",Barzini is dead.
"02:45:40,800","02:45:43,140",So is Philip Tattaglia.
"02:45:44,350","02:45:45,850",Moe Greene.
"02:45:46,810","02:45:50,600",Strachi. Cuneo.
"02:45:52,560","02:45:57,820","Today I settle all family business, so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo."
"02:45:57,900","02:45:59,690",Admit what you did.
"02:46:03,620","02:46:05,280",Get him a drink.
"02:46:11,580","02:46:12,870",Come on.
"02:46:14,210","02:46:16,630","Don't be afraid, Carlo."
"02:46:16,710","02:46:19,590",Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?
"02:46:20,720","02:46:23,430","I'm godfather to your son, Carlo."
"02:46:30,350","02:46:32,390","Go ahead, drink, drink."
"02:46:37,190","02:46:41,030","No, you're out of the family business. That's your punishment."
"02:46:42,110","02:46:46,070",You're finished. I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.
"02:46:46,160","02:46:47,780",Tom.
"02:46:51,910","02:46:55,500",I want you to stay there. Understand?
"02:46:55,580","02:46:58,170",Only don't tell me you're innocent.
"02:46:59,420","02:47:03,680",Because it insults my intelligence. Makes me very angry.
"02:47:07,930","02:47:09,970",Who approached you?
"02:47:11,270","02:47:13,480",Tattaglia or Barzini?
"02:47:21,360","02:47:23,070",It was Barzini.
"02:47:27,200","02:47:28,780",Good.
"02:47:35,000","02:47:39,040",There's a car waiting outside to take you to the airport.
"02:47:39,130","02:47:42,670",I'll call your wife and tell her what flight you're on.
"02:47:46,970","02:47:49,510",- Mike... - Get out of my sight.
"02:48:15,660","02:48:17,290","Hello, Carlo."
"02:49:17,140","02:49:20,270","- I'm trying to tell you... - Mama, please!"
"02:49:28,650","02:49:30,740",Michael!
"02:49:30,820","02:49:32,820",- What is it? - Where is he?
"02:49:35,240","02:49:40,370","Michael, you lousy bastard! You killed my husband."
"02:49:40,460","02:49:44,540","You waited until Papa died, so nobody could stop you."
"02:49:44,630","02:49:47,710",You blamed him for Sonny. Everybody did.
"02:49:47,800","02:49:53,600",But you never thought about me! Now what are we going to do?
"02:49:53,680","02:49:55,310",Connie.
"02:49:57,560","02:50:00,270",Why do you think he kept Carlo at the Mall?
"02:50:00,350","02:50:03,190",He knew he was going to kill him.
"02:50:03,270","02:50:08,610",And you stood godfather to our baby. You lousy cold-hearted bastard!
"02:50:08,690","02:50:12,780",Want to know how many men he had killed with Carlo? Read the papers!
"02:50:12,860","02:50:15,620","That's your husband, that's your husband!"
"02:50:25,290","02:50:29,510","No! No, no..."
"02:50:29,590","02:50:32,970",Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.
"02:50:54,110","02:50:55,820",She's hysterical.
"02:51:00,370","02:51:02,120",Hysterical.
"02:51:04,120","02:51:05,830","Michael, is it true?"
"02:51:07,840","02:51:11,510","- Don't ask me about my business, Kay. - Is it true?"
"02:51:11,590","02:51:14,340",Don't ask me about my business. Enough!
"02:51:34,400","02:51:35,910",All right.
"02:51:38,740","02:51:40,490",This one time.
"02:51:44,460","02:51:47,790",This one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs.
"02:51:53,880","02:51:55,300",Is it true?
"02:51:59,390","02:52:00,890",Is it?
"02:52:02,640","02:52:04,020",No.
"02:52:17,950","02:52:20,910",I guess we both need a drink. Come on.
"02:52:52,190","02:52:53,900",Don Corleone.
