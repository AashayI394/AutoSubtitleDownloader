The.Avengers,"00:00:28,500","00:00:32,457",<i>The Tesseract has awakened.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:00:33,297","00:00:38,255","It is on a little world, a human world."
The.Avengers,"00:00:38,970","00:00:42,302","They would wield its power,"
The.Avengers,"00:00:42,681","00:00:48,351",but our ally knows its workings as they never will.
The.Avengers,"00:00:49,897","00:00:52,981",<i>He is ready to lead</i>
The.Avengers,"00:00:53,192","00:00:58,613","<i>and our force, our Chitauri, will follow.</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:01:00,241","00:01:02,614",<i>A world will be his.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:01:02,827","00:01:05,947","<i>The universe, yours.</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:01:06,164","00:01:12,036","<i>And the humans, what can they do but burn?</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:01:26,268","00:01:27,347","<i>All personnel,</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:01:27,519","00:01:29,808",<i>the evacuation order has been confirmed.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:02:01,722","00:02:03,180",How bad is it?
The.Avengers,"00:02:03,389","00:02:06,675","That's the problem, sir. We don't know."
The.Avengers,"00:02:10,271","00:02:13,189",Dr Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago.
The.Avengers,"00:02:13,316","00:02:15,190",NASA didn't authorise Selvig to go to test phase.
The.Avengers,"00:02:15,402","00:02:17,560",He wasn't testing it. He wasn't even in the room.
The.Avengers,"00:02:17,779","00:02:18,775",Spontaneous event.
The.Avengers,"00:02:18,947","00:02:20,062",It just turned itself on?
The.Avengers,"00:02:20,282","00:02:21,313",Where are the energy levels now?
The.Avengers,"00:02:21,533","00:02:23,692","Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered evac."
The.Avengers,"00:02:23,911","00:02:25,109",How long to get everyone out?
The.Avengers,"00:02:25,329","00:02:26,658",Campus should be clear in the next half-hour.
The.Avengers,"00:02:26,872","00:02:28,117",Do better.
The.Avengers,"00:02:29,083","00:02:31,039","Sir, evacuation may be futile."
The.Avengers,"00:02:31,251","00:02:32,626",We should tell them to go back to sleep?
The.Avengers,"00:02:32,836","00:02:35,043","If we can't control the Tesseract's energy,"
The.Avengers,"00:02:35,255","00:02:37,581",there may not be a minimum safe distance.
The.Avengers,"00:02:37,716","00:02:38,748",I need you to make sure
The.Avengers,"00:02:38,884","00:02:40,544",the Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.
The.Avengers,"00:02:40,720","00:02:42,759","Sir, is that really a priority right now?"
The.Avengers,"00:02:42,972","00:02:44,680","Until such time as the world ends,"
The.Avengers,"00:02:44,807","00:02:46,847",we will act as though it intends to spin on.
The.Avengers,"00:02:47,810","00:02:49,186",Clear out the tech below.
The.Avengers,"00:02:49,395","00:02:51,887",Every piece of Phase 2 on a truck and gone.
The.Avengers,"00:02:52,107","00:02:53,186","Yes, sir."
The.Avengers,"00:02:53,608","00:02:54,771",With me.
The.Avengers,"00:02:57,862","00:02:58,858","Talk to me, Doctor."
The.Avengers,"00:03:00,656","00:03:02,032",Director.
The.Avengers,"00:03:02,241","00:03:03,902",Is there anything we know for certain?
The.Avengers,"00:03:04,118","00:03:06,360",The Tesseract is misbehaving.
The.Avengers,"00:03:06,579","00:03:09,367","- Is that supposed to be funny? - No, it's not funny at all."
The.Avengers,"00:03:09,583","00:03:13,082","The Tesseract is not only active, she's behaving."
The.Avengers,"00:03:13,295","00:03:14,291",I assume you pulled the plug.
The.Avengers,"00:03:14,505","00:03:16,213",She's an energy source.
The.Avengers,"00:03:16,423","00:03:19,460","We turn off the power, she turns it back on."
The.Avengers,"00:03:19,677","00:03:20,756",If she reaches peak level...
The.Avengers,"00:03:20,970","00:03:24,385","We prepared for this, Doctor. Harnessing energy from space."
The.Avengers,"00:03:24,598","00:03:25,973",But we don't have the harness.
The.Avengers,"00:03:26,099","00:03:27,380",My calculations are far from complete.
The.Avengers,"00:03:27,935","00:03:30,473","And she's throwing off interference, radiation."
The.Avengers,"00:03:30,688","00:03:32,396","Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation."
The.Avengers,"00:03:33,315","00:03:35,142",That can be harmful.
The.Avengers,"00:03:35,359","00:03:36,770",Where's Agent Barton?
The.Avengers,"00:03:36,944","00:03:38,652",The Hawk?
The.Avengers,"00:03:39,530","00:03:41,570","Up in his nest, as usual."
The.Avengers,"00:03:43,034","00:03:44,826","<i>Agent Barton, report.</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:03:45,704","00:03:46,866",<i>I gave you this detail</i>
The.Avengers,"00:03:46,997","00:03:48,574",<i>so you could keep a close eye on things.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:03:48,790","00:03:50,166","Well, I see better from a distance."
The.Avengers,"00:03:50,375","00:03:52,332",Have you seen anything that might set this thing off?
The.Avengers,"00:03:52,793","00:03:54,917","Doctor, it's spiking again."
The.Avengers,"00:03:55,129","00:03:56,505",No one's come or gone.
The.Avengers,"00:03:56,714","00:03:58,339",And Selvig's clean.
The.Avengers,"00:03:58,550","00:04:00,839","No contacts, no IMs."
The.Avengers,"00:04:01,344","00:04:03,136","If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end."
The.Avengers,"00:04:05,057","00:04:06,432","""At this end""?"
The.Avengers,"00:04:06,642","00:04:10,474","Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right?"
The.Avengers,"00:04:12,314","00:04:13,595",Doors open from both sides.
The.Avengers,"00:04:14,358","00:04:15,687",Not yet.
The.Avengers,"00:05:23,596","00:05:26,716","Sir, please put down the spear."
The.Avengers,"00:06:06,057","00:06:07,218",You have heart.
The.Avengers,"00:06:37,797","00:06:39,291",Please don't.
The.Avengers,"00:06:41,092","00:06:42,290",I still need that.
The.Avengers,"00:06:42,510","00:06:43,969",This doesn't have to get any messier.
The.Avengers,"00:06:44,179","00:06:45,377",Of course it does.
The.Avengers,"00:06:45,597","00:06:47,471",I've come too far for anything else.
The.Avengers,"00:06:49,434","00:06:52,222","I am Loki, of Asgard"
The.Avengers,"00:06:52,938","00:06:55,310",and I am burdened with glorious purpose.
The.Avengers,"00:06:55,524","00:06:56,935","Loki,"
The.Avengers,"00:06:57,443","00:06:58,723",brother of Thor.
The.Avengers,"00:06:58,945","00:07:01,399",We have no quarrel with your people.
The.Avengers,"00:07:01,613","00:07:04,567",An ant has no quarrel with a boot.
The.Avengers,"00:07:05,159","00:07:06,819",Are you planning to step on us?
The.Avengers,"00:07:07,161","00:07:10,245",I come with glad tidings
The.Avengers,"00:07:11,499","00:07:13,408",of a world made free.
The.Avengers,"00:07:13,793","00:07:14,789",Free from what?
The.Avengers,"00:07:15,002","00:07:16,331",Freedom.
The.Avengers,"00:07:16,879","00:07:19,501",Freedom is life's great lie.
The.Avengers,"00:07:19,716","00:07:23,132","Once you accept that, in your heart,"
The.Avengers,"00:07:27,641","00:07:29,514",you will know peace.
The.Avengers,"00:07:29,809","00:07:32,265","Yeah, you say ""peace,"""
The.Avengers,"00:07:32,478","00:07:34,305",I kind of think you mean the other thing.
The.Avengers,"00:07:34,522","00:07:37,013","Sir, Director Fury is stalling."
The.Avengers,"00:07:37,233","00:07:38,562",This place is about to blow
The.Avengers,"00:07:38,693","00:07:40,401",and drop a hundred feet of rock on us.
The.Avengers,"00:07:41,905","00:07:42,936",He means to bury us.
The.Avengers,"00:07:43,156","00:07:44,271",Like the pharaohs of old.
The.Avengers,"00:07:44,491","00:07:46,448",He's right. The portal is collapsing in on itself.
The.Avengers,"00:07:46,660","00:07:48,867",We've got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.
The.Avengers,"00:07:49,246","00:07:50,242","Well, then."
The.Avengers,"00:08:06,013","00:08:07,092",I need these vehicles.
The.Avengers,"00:08:11,185","00:08:13,308",- Who's that? - They didn't tell me.
The.Avengers,"00:08:16,524","00:08:17,769",<i>Hill!</i>
The.Avengers,"00:08:18,193","00:08:19,473",Do you copy?
The.Avengers,"00:08:20,195","00:08:21,523",<i>Barton has turned.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:08:34,584","00:08:37,420",They have the Tesseract! Shut them down!
The.Avengers,"00:09:13,834","00:09:16,040","Okay, let's go. No, leave it. Go!"
The.Avengers,"00:09:32,519","00:09:34,642","We're clear upstairs, sir. You need to go."
The.Avengers,"00:11:06,616","00:11:07,944",<i>Director?</i>
The.Avengers,"00:11:08,284","00:11:09,778","Director Fury, do you copy?"
The.Avengers,"00:11:09,994","00:11:12,283",The Tesseract is with a hostile force.
The.Avengers,"00:11:12,539","00:11:14,946",I have men down. Hill?
The.Avengers,"00:11:15,292","00:11:17,165",A lot of men still under.
The.Avengers,"00:11:17,377","00:11:19,085",I don't know how many survivors.
The.Avengers,"00:11:19,296","00:11:20,459",<i>Sound a general call.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:11:20,672","00:11:22,380",I want every living soul not working rescue
The.Avengers,"00:11:22,508","00:11:23,504",looking for that briefcase.
The.Avengers,"00:11:23,717","00:11:24,749",Roger that.
The.Avengers,"00:11:24,969","00:11:28,254","Coulson, get back to base. This is a Level Seven."
The.Avengers,"00:11:29,348","00:11:30,926","<i>As of right now,</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:11:31,142","00:11:32,600",we are at war.
The.Avengers,"00:11:34,311","00:11:35,591",What do we do?
The.Avengers,"00:13:21,380","00:13:23,123",...you may have to write it down.
The.Avengers,"00:13:38,439","00:13:41,013","<i>You're at 1- 14 Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor.</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:13:41,276","00:13:43,399",<i>We have an F-22 exactly eight miles out.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:13:44,279","00:13:46,236","<i>Put the woman on the phone, or I will blow up the block</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:13:46,448","00:13:48,487",<i>before you can make the lobby.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:13:54,956","00:13:57,079",<i>- We need you to come in. - Are you kidding? I'm working.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:13:57,292","00:13:58,572",<i>This takes precedence.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:13:58,794","00:14:00,418",I'm in the middle of an interrogation.
The.Avengers,"00:14:00,587","00:14:02,379",This moron is giving me everything.
The.Avengers,"00:14:02,798","00:14:05,419",I don't give everything.
The.Avengers,"00:14:06,844","00:14:08,219","Look, you can't pull me out of this right now."
The.Avengers,"00:14:08,345","00:14:09,341",<i>Natasha...</i>
The.Avengers,"00:14:10,931","00:14:12,426",Barton's been compromised.
The.Avengers,"00:14:15,644","00:14:17,471",Let me put you on hold.
The.Avengers,"00:14:59,231","00:15:00,227",Where is Barton now?
The.Avengers,"00:15:00,399","00:15:01,893",<i>- We don't know. - But he's alive?</i>
The.Avengers,"00:15:02,109","00:15:04,896",We think so. I'll brief you on everything when you get back.
The.Avengers,"00:15:05,154","00:15:07,194","But first, we need you to talk to the big guy."
The.Avengers,"00:15:07,406","00:15:10,490","Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me."
The.Avengers,"00:15:10,701","00:15:14,200",I've got Stark. You get the big guy.
The.Avengers,"00:15:44,235","00:15:45,231",You're a doctor.
The.Avengers,"00:16:02,546","00:16:03,791",Please.
The.Avengers,"00:16:30,992","00:16:33,281","You should've got paid up front, Banner."
The.Avengers,"00:16:33,494","00:16:34,775","You know, for a man"
The.Avengers,"00:16:34,913","00:16:36,193",who's supposed to be avoiding stress
The.Avengers,"00:16:36,414","00:16:39,665",you picked a hell of a place to settle.
The.Avengers,"00:16:41,420","00:16:43,626",Avoiding stress isn't the secret.
The.Avengers,"00:16:43,839","00:16:46,330",Then what is it? Yoga?
The.Avengers,"00:16:47,509","00:16:50,676",You brought me to the edge of the city. Smart.
The.Avengers,"00:16:51,263","00:16:55,308",I assume the whole place is surrounded.
The.Avengers,"00:16:55,768","00:16:57,143",Just you and me.
The.Avengers,"00:16:58,395","00:17:00,435",And your actress buddy?
The.Avengers,"00:17:00,647","00:17:02,605","Is she a spy, too? They start that young?"
The.Avengers,"00:17:03,025","00:17:04,270",I did.
The.Avengers,"00:17:04,485","00:17:05,516",Who are you?
The.Avengers,"00:17:05,736","00:17:06,851",Natasha Romanoff.
The.Avengers,"00:17:10,199","00:17:11,528","Are you here to kill me, Ms Romanoff?"
The.Avengers,"00:17:11,743","00:17:14,448",Because that's not going to work out for everyone.
The.Avengers,"00:17:14,662","00:17:17,118","No, of course not. I'm here on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D."
The.Avengers,"00:17:18,875","00:17:20,369",S.H.I.E.L.D.
The.Avengers,"00:17:22,170","00:17:23,165",How did they find me?
The.Avengers,"00:17:23,337","00:17:24,962","We never lost you, Doctor."
The.Avengers,"00:17:25,173","00:17:26,168",We've kept our distance.
The.Avengers,"00:17:26,382","00:17:28,174",Even helped keep some other interested parties
The.Avengers,"00:17:28,343","00:17:29,374",off your scent.
The.Avengers,"00:17:29,886","00:17:30,882",Why?
The.Avengers,"00:17:31,012","00:17:33,384",Nick Fury seems to trust you.
The.Avengers,"00:17:33,598","00:17:35,223",But now we need you to come in.
The.Avengers,"00:17:36,184","00:17:38,058",What if I say no?
The.Avengers,"00:17:38,270","00:17:40,393",I'll persuade you.
The.Avengers,"00:17:42,524","00:17:46,854",And what if the other guy says no?
The.Avengers,"00:17:47,571","00:17:49,196",You've been more than a year without an incident.
The.Avengers,"00:17:49,407","00:17:51,979",I don't think you want to break that streak.
The.Avengers,"00:17:54,203","00:17:56,824","Well, I don't every time get what I want."
The.Avengers,"00:17:57,873","00:18:00,080","Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe."
The.Avengers,"00:18:00,918","00:18:04,038","Well, those I actively try to avoid."
The.Avengers,"00:18:04,380","00:18:06,420",This
The.Avengers,"00:18:06,632","00:18:09,005",is the Tesseract.
The.Avengers,"00:18:09,219","00:18:12,006",It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.
The.Avengers,"00:18:14,850","00:18:17,008","What does Fury want me to do, swallow it?"
The.Avengers,"00:18:17,226","00:18:19,682",He wants you to find it. It's been taken.
The.Avengers,"00:18:20,521","00:18:24,685",It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace.
The.Avengers,"00:18:24,901","00:18:27,819",There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do.
The.Avengers,"00:18:28,029","00:18:30,817","If there was, that's where I'd be."
The.Avengers,"00:18:31,408","00:18:33,567","So, Fury isn't after the monster?"
The.Avengers,"00:18:33,785","00:18:35,031",Not that he's told me.
The.Avengers,"00:18:35,245","00:18:37,404",And he tells you everything?
The.Avengers,"00:18:38,082","00:18:39,457",Talk to Fury. He needs you on this.
The.Avengers,"00:18:39,583","00:18:40,615",He needs me in a cage?
The.Avengers,"00:18:40,751","00:18:41,747",No one's going to put you in a...
The.Avengers,"00:18:41,919","00:18:42,915",Stop lying to me!
The.Avengers,"00:18:47,132","00:18:49,754",I'm sorry. That was mean.
The.Avengers,"00:18:50,719","00:18:52,878",I just wanted to see what you'd do.
The.Avengers,"00:18:54,098","00:18:57,052",Why don't we do this the easy way
The.Avengers,"00:18:57,268","00:18:58,513",where you don't use that
The.Avengers,"00:18:58,728","00:19:02,642",and the other guy doesn't make a mess.
The.Avengers,"00:19:03,441","00:19:04,722",Okay?
The.Avengers,"00:19:05,735","00:19:07,064",Natasha?
The.Avengers,"00:19:12,742","00:19:13,773",Stand down.
The.Avengers,"00:19:14,744","00:19:16,286",<i>We're good here.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:19:18,122","00:19:19,665","""Just you and me."""
The.Avengers,"00:19:21,835","00:19:24,408","<i>This is out of line, Director.</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:19:24,629","00:19:27,037",<i>You're dealing with forces you can't control.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:19:27,466","00:19:30,917","You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight?"
The.Avengers,"00:19:31,136","00:19:33,924",Did you feel an overabundance of control?
The.Avengers,"00:19:34,140","00:19:37,509",<i>You're saying that this Asgard is declaring war on our planet?</i>
The.Avengers,"00:19:37,643","00:19:40,264",Not Asgard. Loki.
The.Avengers,"00:19:40,479","00:19:43,266",<i>He can't be working alone. What about the other one?</i>
The.Avengers,"00:19:43,398","00:19:44,430",<i>His brother.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:19:44,566","00:19:46,606",Our intelligence says Thor is not a hostile
The.Avengers,"00:19:46,819","00:19:47,815",but he's worlds away.
The.Avengers,"00:19:47,987","00:19:49,778","We can't depend on him to help, either."
The.Avengers,"00:19:49,905","00:19:50,901",It's up to us.
The.Avengers,"00:19:51,032","00:19:53,653",<i>Which is why you should be focusing on Phase 2.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:19:53,826","00:19:55,107",<i>It was designed for exactly this...</i>
The.Avengers,"00:19:55,328","00:19:58,495",Phase 2 isn't ready. Our enemy is.
The.Avengers,"00:19:58,748","00:20:00,290",We need a response team.
The.Avengers,"00:20:00,500","00:20:02,789",<i>The Avengers Initiative was shut down.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:20:03,003","00:20:04,794",This isn't about the Avengers.
The.Avengers,"00:20:05,005","00:20:06,119",<i>We've seen the list.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:20:06,339","00:20:08,545",<i>You're running the world's greatest covert security network</i>
The.Avengers,"00:20:08,674","00:20:10,299",<i>and you're going to leave the fate of the human race</i>
The.Avengers,"00:20:10,468","00:20:11,713",<i>to a handful of freaks.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:20:11,845","00:20:13,754",I'm not leaving anything to anyone.
The.Avengers,"00:20:13,972","00:20:16,178",We need a response team.
The.Avengers,"00:20:16,433","00:20:19,138","These people may be isolated, unbalanced even"
The.Avengers,"00:20:19,353","00:20:23,516",but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need.
The.Avengers,"00:20:23,816","00:20:25,096",<i>You believe?</i>
The.Avengers,"00:20:25,317","00:20:28,900","<i>War isn't won by sentiment, Director.</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:20:29,613","00:20:32,946","No, it's won by soldiers."
The.Avengers,"00:20:52,595","00:20:54,387",<i>There's not enough time.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:20:54,598","00:20:56,140",<i>I got to put her in the water!</i>
The.Avengers,"00:21:01,521","00:21:02,552",<i>You won't be alone.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:21:03,147","00:21:04,642","<i>Oh, my God.</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:21:05,108","00:21:06,270",<i>This guy is still alive!</i>
The.Avengers,"00:21:31,051","00:21:32,795",Trouble sleeping?
The.Avengers,"00:21:34,138","00:21:36,807","I slept for 70 years, sir. I think I've had my fill."
The.Avengers,"00:21:38,351","00:21:42,265","Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world."
The.Avengers,"00:21:48,111","00:21:50,946","When I went under, the world was at war."
The.Avengers,"00:21:51,156","00:21:52,983","I wake up, they say we won."
The.Avengers,"00:21:53,699","00:21:55,242",They didn't say what we lost.
The.Avengers,"00:21:55,827","00:21:58,152",We've made some mistakes along the way.
The.Avengers,"00:21:58,579","00:22:00,240","Some, very recently."
The.Avengers,"00:22:01,791","00:22:02,989","Are you here with a mission, sir?"
The.Avengers,"00:22:03,126","00:22:04,122",I am.
The.Avengers,"00:22:04,252","00:22:05,912",Trying to get me back in the world?
The.Avengers,"00:22:06,421","00:22:08,081",Trying to save it.
The.Avengers,"00:22:12,761","00:22:14,754",HYDRA's secret weapon.
The.Avengers,"00:22:14,972","00:22:17,048",Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean
The.Avengers,"00:22:17,183","00:22:18,297",when he was looking for you.
The.Avengers,"00:22:18,851","00:22:20,511",He thought what we think.
The.Avengers,"00:22:20,769","00:22:24,897",The Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy.
The.Avengers,"00:22:25,357","00:22:29,189",That's something the world sorely needs.
The.Avengers,"00:22:30,696","00:22:31,859",Who took it from you?
The.Avengers,"00:22:32,073","00:22:33,483",He's called Loki.
The.Avengers,"00:22:33,699","00:22:36,321",He's not from around here.
The.Avengers,"00:22:36,786","00:22:38,862",There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on
The.Avengers,"00:22:38,997","00:22:40,195",if you're in.
The.Avengers,"00:22:41,124","00:22:43,164",The world has gotten even stranger
The.Avengers,"00:22:43,293","00:22:44,372",than you already know.
The.Avengers,"00:22:44,878","00:22:47,452","At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me."
The.Avengers,"00:22:48,089","00:22:49,749",Ten bucks says you're wrong.
The.Avengers,"00:22:51,509","00:22:52,884",There's a debriefing packet
The.Avengers,"00:22:53,011","00:22:55,383",waiting for you back at your apartment.
The.Avengers,"00:22:57,766","00:22:59,675",Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract
The.Avengers,"00:22:59,810","00:23:01,008",that we ought to know now?
The.Avengers,"00:23:01,311","00:23:03,600",You should have left it in the ocean.
The.Avengers,"00:23:36,348","00:23:39,218",<i>Good to go on this end. The rest is up to you.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:23:39,434","00:23:40,763",<i>You disconnected the transmission lines?</i>
The.Avengers,"00:23:40,894","00:23:41,889",<i>Are we off the grid?</i>
The.Avengers,"00:23:42,019","00:23:44,178",Stark Tower is about to become a beacon
The.Avengers,"00:23:44,355","00:23:45,814",of self-sustaining clean energy.
The.Avengers,"00:23:45,940","00:23:47,980","<i>Well, assuming the arc reactor takes over</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:23:48,109","00:23:49,307",<i>and it actually works.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:23:49,694","00:23:50,975",<i>I assume.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:23:51,488","00:23:52,484",Light her up.
The.Avengers,"00:23:58,036","00:23:59,032",<i>How does it look?</i>
The.Avengers,"00:23:59,204","00:24:01,874","Like Christmas, but with more me."
The.Avengers,"00:24:02,082","00:24:03,826",<i>We've got to go wider on the public awareness campaign.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:24:04,043","00:24:05,074",<i>You need to do some press.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:24:05,711","00:24:06,707","<i>I'm in DC tomorrow,</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:24:06,879","00:24:08,373",<i>I'm working on the zoning for the next three buildings.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:24:08,548","00:24:10,753","<i>Pepper, you're killing me. The moment, remember?</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:24:10,966","00:24:11,997",<i>Enjoy the moment.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:24:12,217","00:24:13,380",<i>Get in here and I will.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:24:16,722","00:24:19,640","<i>Sir, Agent Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D. Is on the line.</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:24:20,226","00:24:21,222",<i>I'm not in.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:24:21,894","00:24:23,175",I'm actually out.
The.Avengers,"00:24:30,403","00:24:33,025","<i>Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:24:33,240","00:24:35,991","Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date."
The.Avengers,"00:24:40,538","00:24:43,492","Levels are holding steady, I think."
The.Avengers,"00:24:43,708","00:24:45,867",Of course they are. I was directly involved.
The.Avengers,"00:24:46,086","00:24:47,248",Which brings me to my next question.
The.Avengers,"00:24:47,420","00:24:49,378",How does it feel to be a genius?
The.Avengers,"00:24:49,589","00:24:51,831","Well, I really wouldn't know, now would I?"
The.Avengers,"00:24:52,050","00:24:56,547",What do you mean? All this came from you.
The.Avengers,"00:24:56,764","00:25:00,382","No, all this came from that."
The.Avengers,"00:25:00,601","00:25:02,890",Give yourself some credit. Please.
The.Avengers,"00:25:03,103","00:25:04,894",Stark Tower is your baby.
The.Avengers,"00:25:05,105","00:25:07,477",Give yourself 12% of the credit.
The.Avengers,"00:25:07,941","00:25:09,056",12%?
The.Avengers,"00:25:09,193","00:25:10,307",An argument can be made for 15.
The.Avengers,"00:25:10,444","00:25:12,022",12%? My baby?
The.Avengers,"00:25:12,238","00:25:13,815","Well, I did do all the heavy lifting."
The.Avengers,"00:25:13,948","00:25:15,822","Literally, I lifted the heavy things."
The.Avengers,"00:25:16,075","00:25:18,317","And, sorry, but the security snafu?"
The.Avengers,"00:25:18,453","00:25:19,911",That was on you.
The.Avengers,"00:25:20,079","00:25:22,155",- My private elevator... - You mean our elevator?
The.Avengers,"00:25:22,373","00:25:25,043",...it was teeming with sweaty workmen.
The.Avengers,"00:25:25,252","00:25:27,577",I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages
The.Avengers,"00:25:27,796","00:25:29,753","in some subtle way later, aren't I?"
The.Avengers,"00:25:30,214","00:25:31,412",It's not going to be that subtle.
The.Avengers,"00:25:31,632","00:25:32,913",I'll tell you what.
The.Avengers,"00:25:33,134","00:25:35,590","The next building is gonna say ""Potts"" on the tower."
The.Avengers,"00:25:35,803","00:25:37,179",On the lease.
The.Avengers,"00:25:38,098","00:25:40,221",Call your mom. Can you bunk over?
The.Avengers,"00:25:40,433","00:25:41,678","<i>Sir, the telephone.</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:25:41,893","00:25:44,266",<i>I'm afraid my protocols are being overridden.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:25:44,479","00:25:46,437","<i>Mr Stark, we need to talk.</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:25:46,732","00:25:49,057",You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark.
The.Avengers,"00:25:49,318","00:25:51,275",<i>- Please leave a message. - This is urgent.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:25:51,487","00:25:53,278",Then leave it urgently.
The.Avengers,"00:25:54,824","00:25:55,938",Security breach. It's on you.
The.Avengers,"00:25:56,159","00:25:58,862",- Mr Stark. - Phil! Come in.
The.Avengers,"00:25:59,036","00:26:00,031","""Phil""?"
The.Avengers,"00:26:00,162","00:26:01,193",I can't stay.
The.Avengers,"00:26:01,413","00:26:02,611","His first name is ""Agent."""
The.Avengers,"00:26:02,831","00:26:04,456",Come on in. We're celebrating.
The.Avengers,"00:26:04,667","00:26:06,458",Which is why he can't stay.
The.Avengers,"00:26:06,669","00:26:08,626",We need you to look this over as soon as possible.
The.Avengers,"00:26:08,838","00:26:09,869",I don't like being handed things.
The.Avengers,"00:26:10,089","00:26:11,548","That's fine, because I love to be handed things."
The.Avengers,"00:26:11,757","00:26:13,086","So, let's trade."
The.Avengers,"00:26:14,469","00:26:15,963",Thank you.
The.Avengers,"00:26:17,180","00:26:19,386",Official consulting hours are between 8 and 5
The.Avengers,"00:26:19,516","00:26:20,512",every other Thursday.
The.Avengers,"00:26:20,684","00:26:21,680",This isn't a consultation.
The.Avengers,"00:26:21,810","00:26:23,055",Is this about the Avengers?
The.Avengers,"00:26:23,478","00:26:25,304",Which I know nothing about.
The.Avengers,"00:26:25,521","00:26:28,059","The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought."
The.Avengers,"00:26:28,274","00:26:29,650",And I didn't even qualify.
The.Avengers,"00:26:29,859","00:26:30,855",I didn't know that either.
The.Avengers,"00:26:31,027","00:26:33,898","Apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed,"
The.Avengers,"00:26:34,030","00:26:35,275",don't play well with others.
The.Avengers,"00:26:35,574","00:26:36,569",That I did know.
The.Avengers,"00:26:36,700","00:26:38,324",This isn't about personality profiles any more.
The.Avengers,"00:26:38,493","00:26:40,819","Whatever. Ms Potts, got a second?"
The.Avengers,"00:26:41,038","00:26:42,034",Half a mo.
The.Avengers,"00:26:47,336","00:26:49,662","You know, I thought we were having a moment."
The.Avengers,"00:26:49,881","00:26:51,457",I was having 12% of a moment.
The.Avengers,"00:26:52,674","00:26:55,130",This seems serious. Phil's pretty shaken.
The.Avengers,"00:26:55,344","00:26:57,301","How would you know if it's... Why is he ""Phil""?"
The.Avengers,"00:26:57,513","00:26:59,256",What is all this?
The.Avengers,"00:26:59,473","00:27:01,015",This is
The.Avengers,"00:27:01,726","00:27:02,721",this.
The.Avengers,"00:27:10,068","00:27:11,443",I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.
The.Avengers,"00:27:11,569","00:27:12,601",Tomorrow.
The.Avengers,"00:27:12,737","00:27:15,026",You have homework. You have a lot of homework.
The.Avengers,"00:27:15,240","00:27:16,948","Well, what if I didn't?"
The.Avengers,"00:27:17,576","00:27:18,950",- Lf you didn't? - Yeah.
The.Avengers,"00:27:19,160","00:27:21,318",You mean when you've finished?
The.Avengers,"00:27:22,413","00:27:25,699","Well, then..."
The.Avengers,"00:27:30,922","00:27:32,203",Square deal. Fly safe.
The.Avengers,"00:27:36,428","00:27:37,543",Work hard.
The.Avengers,"00:27:40,433","00:27:42,176","So, any chance you're driving by LaGuardia?"
The.Avengers,"00:27:42,393","00:27:45,145",- I can drop you. - Fantastic.
The.Avengers,"00:27:45,271","00:27:46,266",I want to hear
The.Avengers,"00:27:46,396","00:27:48,056",about the cellist. Is that still a thing?
The.Avengers,"00:27:48,273","00:27:49,388",She moved back to Portland.
The.Avengers,"00:27:49,608","00:27:52,728",What? Boo!
The.Avengers,"00:28:00,787","00:28:03,194","We're about 40 minutes out from home base, sir."
The.Avengers,"00:28:06,918","00:28:10,583","So, this Dr Banner was trying to replicate the serum they used on me?"
The.Avengers,"00:28:10,797","00:28:12,340",A lot of people were.
The.Avengers,"00:28:12,548","00:28:14,173",You were the world's first superhero.
The.Avengers,"00:28:14,884","00:28:17,589",Banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking
The.Avengers,"00:28:17,762","00:28:19,091",Erskine's original formula.
The.Avengers,"00:28:20,140","00:28:21,515","Didn't really go his way, did it?"
The.Avengers,"00:28:21,933","00:28:23,392",Not so much.
The.Avengers,"00:28:23,602","00:28:26,437","When he's not that thing, though, the guy's like a Stephen Hawking."
The.Avengers,"00:28:28,482","00:28:31,020",He's like a smart person.
The.Avengers,"00:28:33,153","00:28:34,268","I gotta say,"
The.Avengers,"00:28:34,613","00:28:37,021",it's an honour to meet you officially.
The.Avengers,"00:28:37,783","00:28:39,278","I've sort of met you. I mean,"
The.Avengers,"00:28:39,452","00:28:41,242",I watched you while you were sleeping.
The.Avengers,"00:28:43,080","00:28:45,286","I mean, I was present"
The.Avengers,"00:28:45,499","00:28:48,785",while you were unconscious from the ice.
The.Avengers,"00:28:49,003","00:28:51,292","You know, it's really just a huge honour"
The.Avengers,"00:28:51,422","00:28:53,379",to have you on board this...
The.Avengers,"00:28:53,758","00:28:55,632",I hope I'm the man for the job.
The.Avengers,"00:28:55,843","00:28:58,714","Oh, you are. Absolutely."
The.Avengers,"00:28:58,930","00:29:01,801",We made some modifications to the uniform.
The.Avengers,"00:29:02,017","00:29:03,511",I had a little design input.
The.Avengers,"00:29:03,727","00:29:04,972",The uniform?
The.Avengers,"00:29:05,187","00:29:07,677",Aren't the stars and stripes a little
The.Avengers,"00:29:08,856","00:29:10,185",old-fashioned?
The.Avengers,"00:29:11,025","00:29:13,184",With everything that's happening
The.Avengers,"00:29:13,403","00:29:15,027","and the things that are about to come to light,"
The.Avengers,"00:29:15,905","00:29:19,357",people might just need a little old-fashioned.
The.Avengers,"00:29:51,901","00:29:54,855",The Chitauri grow restless.
The.Avengers,"00:29:55,071","00:29:56,779",Let them gird themselves.
The.Avengers,"00:29:56,907","00:29:58,698",I will lead them in the glorious battle.
The.Avengers,"00:29:58,909","00:30:00,071",Battle?
The.Avengers,"00:30:00,910","00:30:03,994",Against the meagre might of Earth?
The.Avengers,"00:30:04,205","00:30:07,040","Glorious, not lengthy."
The.Avengers,"00:30:07,250","00:30:11,034",If your force is as formidable as you claim.
The.Avengers,"00:30:11,254","00:30:13,745",You question us?
The.Avengers,"00:30:13,965","00:30:16,089","You question him,"
The.Avengers,"00:30:16,260","00:30:18,715",he who put the sceptre in your hand?
The.Avengers,"00:30:18,929","00:30:21,847",Who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose
The.Avengers,"00:30:22,057","00:30:24,928","when you were cast out, defeated?"
The.Avengers,"00:30:25,144","00:30:27,018",I was a king!
The.Avengers,"00:30:27,230","00:30:29,435","The rightful king of Asgard,"
The.Avengers,"00:30:29,940","00:30:30,936",betrayed.
The.Avengers,"00:30:31,608","00:30:34,230",Your ambition is little
The.Avengers,"00:30:34,445","00:30:37,197",and born of childish need.
The.Avengers,"00:30:37,406","00:30:39,399",We look beyond the Earth
The.Avengers,"00:30:39,617","00:30:42,571",to the greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil.
The.Avengers,"00:30:43,037","00:30:44,448",You don't have the Tesseract yet.
The.Avengers,"00:30:47,250","00:30:48,246",I don't threaten.
The.Avengers,"00:30:49,794","00:30:52,368","But until I open the doors,"
The.Avengers,"00:30:52,589","00:30:56,206","until your force is mine to command,"
The.Avengers,"00:30:56,968","00:30:58,759",you are but words.
The.Avengers,"00:30:58,970","00:31:02,920","You will have your war, Asgardian."
The.Avengers,"00:31:04,726","00:31:06,719","If you fail,"
The.Avengers,"00:31:07,729","00:31:12,107","if the Tesseract is kept from us,"
The.Avengers,"00:31:12,317","00:31:16,695","there will be no realm, no barren moon,"
The.Avengers,"00:31:16,906","00:31:20,191",no crevice where he cannot find you.
The.Avengers,"00:31:21,786","00:31:24,537",You think you know pain?
The.Avengers,"00:31:24,746","00:31:30,417",He will make you long for something sweet as pain.
The.Avengers,"00:31:59,616","00:32:00,647",Stow the captain's gear.
The.Avengers,"00:32:00,784","00:32:01,780","Yes, sir."
The.Avengers,"00:32:03,328","00:32:06,448","Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers."
The.Avengers,"00:32:06,665","00:32:07,946",- Ma'am. - Hi.
The.Avengers,"00:32:08,125","00:32:09,121",They need you on the bridge.
The.Avengers,"00:32:09,251","00:32:10,746",They're starting the face-trace.
The.Avengers,"00:32:10,961","00:32:12,041",See you there.
The.Avengers,"00:32:13,798","00:32:17,925","It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice."
The.Avengers,"00:32:18,218","00:32:20,792",I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.
The.Avengers,"00:32:21,013","00:32:23,884",Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?
The.Avengers,"00:32:24,099","00:32:25,298",Trading cards?
The.Avengers,"00:32:25,518","00:32:27,676",They're vintage. He's very proud.
The.Avengers,"00:32:29,438","00:32:30,719",Dr Banner.
The.Avengers,"00:32:32,734","00:32:34,014","Yeah, hi."
The.Avengers,"00:32:34,569","00:32:35,767",They told me you would be coming.
The.Avengers,"00:32:35,987","00:32:37,268","Word is, you can find the Cube."
The.Avengers,"00:32:38,323","00:32:40,197",Is that the only word on me?
The.Avengers,"00:32:40,617","00:32:41,780",Only word I care about.
The.Avengers,"00:32:44,370","00:32:46,956","It must be strange for you, all of this."
The.Avengers,"00:32:47,665","00:32:50,335","Well, this is actually kind of familiar."
The.Avengers,"00:32:50,543","00:32:53,117","Gentlemen, you might want to step inside in a minute."
The.Avengers,"00:32:53,338","00:32:56,090",It's going to get a little hard to breathe.
The.Avengers,"00:32:57,342","00:32:58,884","<i>Flight crew, secure the deck.</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:33:03,390","00:33:04,968",Is this a submarine?
The.Avengers,"00:33:05,518","00:33:06,513",Really?
The.Avengers,"00:33:06,644","00:33:10,392","They want me in a submerged, pressurised, metal container?"
The.Avengers,"00:33:36,800","00:33:39,171","No, no, this is much worse."
The.Avengers,"00:34:08,999","00:34:11,704",Hover power check complete. Position cyclic.
The.Avengers,"00:34:11,919","00:34:14,327",Increase collective to 8.0%.
The.Avengers,"00:34:19,427","00:34:21,716",Preparing for maximum performance takeoff.
The.Avengers,"00:34:21,846","00:34:23,340",Increase output to capacity.
The.Avengers,"00:34:23,515","00:34:25,638",Power plant performing at capacity.
The.Avengers,"00:34:25,850","00:34:27,309",We are clear.
The.Avengers,"00:34:27,519","00:34:29,013",All engines operating.
The.Avengers,"00:34:29,229","00:34:33,855",S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency Protocol 193.6 in effect.
The.Avengers,"00:34:34,108","00:34:36,646","- We are at level, sir. - Good."
The.Avengers,"00:34:37,028","00:34:38,024",Let's vanish.
The.Avengers,"00:34:38,238","00:34:40,645",Engage retro-reflection panels.
The.Avengers,"00:34:56,424","00:34:57,586",Reflection panels engaged.
The.Avengers,"00:34:58,217","00:34:59,592",Gentlemen.
The.Avengers,"00:35:11,939","00:35:13,054","Doctor, thank you for coming."
The.Avengers,"00:35:15,068","00:35:16,941",Thanks for asking nicely.
The.Avengers,"00:35:17,153","00:35:19,775","So, how long am I staying?"
The.Avengers,"00:35:19,990","00:35:21,781","Once we get our hands on the Tesseract,"
The.Avengers,"00:35:21,908","00:35:23,106",you're in the wind.
The.Avengers,"00:35:23,243","00:35:25,070",Where are you with that?
The.Avengers,"00:35:25,287","00:35:27,029",We're sweeping every wirelessly accessible
The.Avengers,"00:35:27,163","00:35:28,159",camera on the planet.
The.Avengers,"00:35:28,748","00:35:30,539","Cell phones, laptops..."
The.Avengers,"00:35:31,084","00:35:34,370","If it's connected to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for us."
The.Avengers,"00:35:34,587","00:35:35,833",That's still not gonna find them in time.
The.Avengers,"00:35:36,047","00:35:37,043",You have to narrow your field.
The.Avengers,"00:35:37,257","00:35:39,214",How many spectrometers do you have access to?
The.Avengers,"00:35:39,426","00:35:41,051",- How many are there? - Call every lab you know.
The.Avengers,"00:35:41,261","00:35:42,969",Tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof
The.Avengers,"00:35:43,097","00:35:44,555",and calibrate them for gamma rays.
The.Avengers,"00:35:44,765","00:35:47,968","I'll rough out a tracking algorithm, basic cluster recognition."
The.Avengers,"00:35:48,269","00:35:50,677",At least we could rule out a few places.
The.Avengers,"00:35:50,938","00:35:52,729",Do you have somewhere for me to work?
The.Avengers,"00:35:52,981","00:35:54,096","Agent Romanoff,"
The.Avengers,"00:35:54,274","00:35:56,516","could you show Dr Banner to his laboratory, please?"
The.Avengers,"00:35:57,653","00:35:59,895","You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys."
The.Avengers,"00:36:00,447","00:36:02,239",Put it over there.
The.Avengers,"00:36:04,243","00:36:06,366",Where did you find all these people?
The.Avengers,"00:36:06,579","00:36:09,533","S.H.I.E.L.D. Has no shortage of enemies, Doctor."
The.Avengers,"00:36:09,999","00:36:11,079",Is this the stuff you need?
The.Avengers,"00:36:11,251","00:36:12,246","Yeah, iridium."
The.Avengers,"00:36:12,419","00:36:15,040",It's found in meteorites. It forms anti-protons.
The.Avengers,"00:36:15,255","00:36:16,880",It's very hard to get hold of.
The.Avengers,"00:36:17,090","00:36:18,632",Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D. Knows you need it.
The.Avengers,"00:36:18,842","00:36:20,216","Well, I didn't know."
The.Avengers,"00:36:20,426","00:36:21,624",Hey!
The.Avengers,"00:36:21,844","00:36:24,133",The Tesseract has shown me so much.
The.Avengers,"00:36:24,597","00:36:26,507",It's more than knowledge. It's truth.
The.Avengers,"00:36:26,641","00:36:27,637",I know.
The.Avengers,"00:36:28,476","00:36:30,386","What did it show you, Agent Barton?"
The.Avengers,"00:36:31,354","00:36:32,765",My next target.
The.Avengers,"00:36:32,939","00:36:33,935",Tell me what you need.
The.Avengers,"00:36:37,444","00:36:39,271",I need a distraction.
The.Avengers,"00:36:40,197","00:36:41,608",And an eyeball.
The.Avengers,"00:36:48,372","00:36:50,910","I mean, if it's not too much trouble."
The.Avengers,"00:36:51,125","00:36:52,156","No, no. It's fine."
The.Avengers,"00:36:55,212","00:36:56,790",It's a vintage set.
The.Avengers,"00:36:57,006","00:36:59,295",It took me a couple of years to collect them all.
The.Avengers,"00:37:01,844","00:37:02,924",Near mint.
The.Avengers,"00:37:03,137","00:37:04,513","Slight foxing around the edges, but..."
The.Avengers,"00:37:04,722","00:37:07,344",We got a hit. A 67% match.
The.Avengers,"00:37:07,851","00:37:09,475","Wait. Cross match, 79%."
The.Avengers,"00:37:10,479","00:37:11,474",Location?
The.Avengers,"00:37:11,646","00:37:14,682","Stuttgart, Germany. 28 Königstrasse."
The.Avengers,"00:37:14,899","00:37:16,144",He's not exactly hiding.
The.Avengers,"00:37:16,359","00:37:17,474","Captain,"
The.Avengers,"00:37:17,819","00:37:18,815",you're up.
The.Avengers,"00:39:54,356","00:39:55,471",Kneel before me.
The.Avengers,"00:39:59,944","00:40:01,225",I said
The.Avengers,"00:40:03,323","00:40:05,481",kneel!
The.Avengers,"00:40:14,793","00:40:18,163",Is not this simpler?
The.Avengers,"00:40:19,715","00:40:22,919",Is this not your natural state?
The.Avengers,"00:40:25,220","00:40:28,424","It's the unspoken truth of humanity,"
The.Avengers,"00:40:28,640","00:40:31,013",that you crave subjugation.
The.Avengers,"00:40:31,560","00:40:35,344",The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy
The.Avengers,"00:40:35,564","00:40:38,138","in a mad scramble for power,"
The.Avengers,"00:40:39,986","00:40:41,361",for identity.
The.Avengers,"00:40:43,031","00:40:46,365",You were made to be ruled.
The.Avengers,"00:40:46,993","00:40:48,618","In the end,"
The.Avengers,"00:40:48,870","00:40:51,158",you will always kneel.
The.Avengers,"00:40:58,546","00:41:00,504",Not to men like you.
The.Avengers,"00:41:01,550","00:41:03,459",There are no men like me.
The.Avengers,"00:41:04,344","00:41:07,215",There are always men like you.
The.Avengers,"00:41:08,515","00:41:10,342","Look to your elder, people."
The.Avengers,"00:41:12,561","00:41:13,972",Let him be an example.
The.Avengers,"00:41:20,777","00:41:23,351","You know, the last time I was in Germany,"
The.Avengers,"00:41:23,572","00:41:26,739","and saw a man standing above everybody else,"
The.Avengers,"00:41:26,951","00:41:28,410",we ended up disagreeing.
The.Avengers,"00:41:28,619","00:41:30,576",The soldier.
The.Avengers,"00:41:32,623","00:41:33,868",The man out of time.
The.Avengers,"00:41:34,459","00:41:35,704",I'm not the one who's out of time.
The.Avengers,"00:41:39,214","00:41:41,752","<i>Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:42:02,112","00:42:03,690",Kneel.
The.Avengers,"00:42:03,822","00:42:05,233",Not today!
The.Avengers,"00:42:07,326","00:42:08,607",The guy's all over the place.
The.Avengers,"00:42:12,122","00:42:14,447",<i>Agent Romanoff. You miss me?</i>
The.Avengers,"00:42:31,184","00:42:33,260","<i>Make your move, Reindeer Games.</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:42:41,319","00:42:42,778",<i>Good move.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:42:44,280","00:42:45,561",Mr Stark.
The.Avengers,"00:42:46,241","00:42:47,403",<i>Captain.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:42:54,625","00:42:56,249",<i>Is he saying anything?</i>
The.Avengers,"00:42:56,460","00:42:57,705",Not a word.
The.Avengers,"00:42:58,003","00:42:59,913",<i>Just get him here. We're low on time.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:43:02,967","00:43:03,963",I don't like it.
The.Avengers,"00:43:04,343","00:43:06,300","What, Rock of Ages giving up so easily?"
The.Avengers,"00:43:06,511","00:43:08,171",I don't remember it being that easy.
The.Avengers,"00:43:08,347","00:43:09,805",This guy packs a wallop.
The.Avengers,"00:43:10,015","00:43:13,598","Still, you are pretty spry for an older fellow."
The.Avengers,"00:43:14,645","00:43:16,223","What's your thing, Pilates?"
The.Avengers,"00:43:16,397","00:43:17,393",What?
The.Avengers,"00:43:17,565","00:43:18,561",It's like calisthenics.
The.Avengers,"00:43:18,691","00:43:20,731",You might have missed a couple of things
The.Avengers,"00:43:20,943","00:43:22,568",doing time as a Capsicle.
The.Avengers,"00:43:24,489","00:43:26,067",Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.
The.Avengers,"00:43:26,282","00:43:29,153","Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you."
The.Avengers,"00:43:29,536","00:43:31,114",Where's this coming from?
The.Avengers,"00:43:35,208","00:43:37,781",What's the matter? Are you scared of a little lightning?
The.Avengers,"00:43:38,211","00:43:40,500",I'm not overly fond of what follows.
The.Avengers,"00:43:58,316","00:43:59,477",What are you doing?
The.Avengers,"00:44:12,413","00:44:13,872",<i>And now there's that guy.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:44:14,081","00:44:15,825",Another Asgardian?
The.Avengers,"00:44:16,042","00:44:17,869",<i>- That guy's a friendly? - Doesn't matter.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:44:18,086","00:44:20,659","<i>If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost.</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:44:20,880","00:44:22,707","Stark, we need a plan of attack!"
The.Avengers,"00:44:22,924","00:44:25,213",<i>I have a plan. Attack.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:44:31,224","00:44:33,015","I'd sit this one out, Cap."
The.Avengers,"00:44:33,226","00:44:34,222",I don't see how I can.
The.Avengers,"00:44:34,436","00:44:37,057",These guys come from legend. They're basically gods.
The.Avengers,"00:44:37,522","00:44:38,803","There's only one God, ma'am."
The.Avengers,"00:44:38,940","00:44:41,313",And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.
The.Avengers,"00:44:56,792","00:44:58,167",Where is the Tesseract?
The.Avengers,"00:44:58,377","00:44:59,657","I missed you, too."
The.Avengers,"00:44:59,878","00:45:01,547",Do I look to be in a gaming mood?
The.Avengers,"00:45:02,256","00:45:03,631",You should thank me.
The.Avengers,"00:45:04,091","00:45:06,131","With the Bifrost gone, how much dark energy"
The.Avengers,"00:45:06,344","00:45:09,096",did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here
The.Avengers,"00:45:09,305","00:45:10,681",to your precious Earth?
The.Avengers,"00:45:14,811","00:45:16,092",I thought you dead.
The.Avengers,"00:45:17,731","00:45:19,142",Did you mourn?
The.Avengers,"00:45:19,608","00:45:21,398",We all did. Our father...
The.Avengers,"00:45:21,734","00:45:24,652",Your father.
The.Avengers,"00:45:26,531","00:45:29,402","He did tell you my true parentage, did he not?"
The.Avengers,"00:45:31,953","00:45:34,195",We were raised together.
The.Avengers,"00:45:34,414","00:45:37,036","We played together, we fought together."
The.Avengers,"00:45:37,543","00:45:38,741",Do you remember none of that?
The.Avengers,"00:45:38,961","00:45:40,918",I remember a shadow.
The.Avengers,"00:45:42,423","00:45:45,459",Living in the shade of your greatness.
The.Avengers,"00:45:46,177","00:45:48,797",I remember you tossing me into an abyss.
The.Avengers,"00:45:48,929","00:45:50,922","I, who was, and should be, king!"
The.Avengers,"00:45:51,139","00:45:53,216",So you take the world I love as a recompense
The.Avengers,"00:45:53,350","00:45:55,177",for your imagined slights?
The.Avengers,"00:45:55,394","00:45:58,479","No. The Earth is under my protection, Loki."
The.Avengers,"00:45:59,899","00:46:03,434",And you're doing a marvellous job with that.
The.Avengers,"00:46:03,903","00:46:05,860",The humans slaughter each other in droves
The.Avengers,"00:46:05,989","00:46:07,780",while you idly fret.
The.Avengers,"00:46:07,991","00:46:10,149","I mean to rule them, as why should I not?"
The.Avengers,"00:46:10,368","00:46:11,911",You think yourself above them?
The.Avengers,"00:46:12,996","00:46:13,992","Well, yes."
The.Avengers,"00:46:14,206","00:46:16,660","Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother."
The.Avengers,"00:46:17,500","00:46:18,875",A throne would suit you ill.
The.Avengers,"00:46:24,090","00:46:26,842",I've seen worlds you've never known about!
The.Avengers,"00:46:27,052","00:46:31,216","I have grown, Odinson, in my exile."
The.Avengers,"00:46:31,598","00:46:33,556","I have seen the true power of the Tesseract,"
The.Avengers,"00:46:33,684","00:46:34,763",and when I wield it...
The.Avengers,"00:46:34,977","00:46:36,720",Who showed you this power?
The.Avengers,"00:46:37,897","00:46:39,225",Who controls the would-be king?
The.Avengers,"00:46:39,440","00:46:41,232",- I am a king! - Not here!
The.Avengers,"00:46:41,442","00:46:42,722",You give up the Tesseract!
The.Avengers,"00:46:42,859","00:46:45,397",You give up this poisonous dream!
The.Avengers,"00:46:48,115","00:46:49,490",You come home.
The.Avengers,"00:46:54,455","00:46:55,570",I don't have it.
The.Avengers,"00:46:57,667","00:46:59,458",You need the Cube to bring me home.
The.Avengers,"00:46:59,586","00:47:01,911","But I've sent it off, I know not where."
The.Avengers,"00:47:03,048","00:47:04,875","You listen well, brother."
The.Avengers,"00:47:06,843","00:47:08,041",I'm listening.
The.Avengers,"00:47:17,187","00:47:18,847",Do not touch me again.
The.Avengers,"00:47:19,064","00:47:20,641",Then don't take my stuff.
The.Avengers,"00:47:20,857","00:47:23,099",You have no idea what you're dealing with.
The.Avengers,"00:47:24,987","00:47:25,983",Shakespeare in the Park?
The.Avengers,"00:47:27,364","00:47:30,484",Doth Mother know you wear-eth her drapes?
The.Avengers,"00:47:30,743","00:47:33,495","This is beyond you, metal man."
The.Avengers,"00:47:33,704","00:47:35,826",Loki will face Asgardian justice.
The.Avengers,"00:47:36,039","00:47:39,408","He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then,"
The.Avengers,"00:47:39,793","00:47:41,038",<i>stay out of the way.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:47:42,588","00:47:44,212",<i>Tourist.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:47:49,595","00:47:50,627",Okay.
The.Avengers,"00:48:20,419","00:48:23,337",Power at 400% capacity.
The.Avengers,"00:48:23,547","00:48:25,089",How about that?
The.Avengers,"00:49:25,402","00:49:26,600",Hey!
The.Avengers,"00:49:29,156","00:49:30,354",That's enough.
The.Avengers,"00:49:34,245","00:49:35,953","Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here."
The.Avengers,"00:49:36,163","00:49:38,452",I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes.
The.Avengers,"00:49:38,666","00:49:41,204",Then prove it. Put that hammer down.
The.Avengers,"00:49:41,336","00:49:42,331",Yeah... No.
The.Avengers,"00:49:42,587","00:49:44,046",<i>Bad call. He loves his hammer.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:49:45,632","00:49:47,874",You want me to put the hammer down?
The.Avengers,"00:50:15,246","00:50:16,906","Are we done, here?"
The.Avengers,"00:51:04,797","00:51:07,751","In case it's unclear,"
The.Avengers,"00:51:08,467","00:51:10,259","if you try to escape,"
The.Avengers,"00:51:11,345","00:51:13,633","if you so much as scratch that glass,"
The.Avengers,"00:51:23,232","00:51:27,182","it's 30,000 feet straight down in a steel trap."
The.Avengers,"00:51:27,737","00:51:29,860",You get how that works?
The.Avengers,"00:51:31,908","00:51:34,530","Ant, boot."
The.Avengers,"00:51:37,873","00:51:39,615",It's an impressive cage.
The.Avengers,"00:51:40,541","00:51:43,163","Not built, I think, for me."
The.Avengers,"00:51:43,544","00:51:45,952",Built for something a lot stronger than you.
The.Avengers,"00:51:46,172","00:51:48,046","Oh, I've heard."
The.Avengers,"00:51:49,050","00:51:50,213",<i>A mindless beast.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:51:51,219","00:51:52,844",<i>Makes play he's still a man.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:51:53,930","00:51:56,172","<i>How desperate are you,</i>"
The.Avengers,"00:51:56,391","00:51:59,476",<i>that you call on such lost creatures to defend you?</i>
The.Avengers,"00:51:59,687","00:52:02,012",<i>How desperate am I?</i>
The.Avengers,"00:52:02,231","00:52:04,023",You threaten my world with war.
The.Avengers,"00:52:04,233","00:52:06,356",You steal a force you can't hope to control.
The.Avengers,"00:52:06,568","00:52:10,352","You talk about peace, and you kill because it's fun."
The.Avengers,"00:52:10,572","00:52:13,573",You have made me very desperate.
The.Avengers,"00:52:13,784","00:52:15,693",You might not be glad that you did.
The.Avengers,"00:52:18,956","00:52:22,242",It burns you to have come so close.
The.Avengers,"00:52:23,711","00:52:26,416","To have the Tesseract, to have power,"
The.Avengers,"00:52:27,215","00:52:29,422",unlimited power.
The.Avengers,"00:52:29,634","00:52:31,592",And for what?
The.Avengers,"00:52:33,263","00:52:37,056",A warm light for all mankind to share.
The.Avengers,"00:52:37,308","00:52:40,558",And then to be reminded what real power is.
The.Avengers,"00:52:44,649","00:52:48,943","Well, let me know if ""real power"" wants a magazine or something."
The.Avengers,"00:52:57,288","00:52:58,747","He really grows on you, doesn't he?"
The.Avengers,"00:52:58,956","00:53:00,865",Loki's gonna drag this out.
The.Avengers,"00:53:01,083","00:53:04,534","So, Thor, what's his play?"
The.Avengers,"00:53:04,753","00:53:07,291",He has an army called the Chitauri.
The.Avengers,"00:53:07,506","00:53:10,424","They're not of Asgard, nor any world known."
The.Avengers,"00:53:10,843","00:53:12,919",He means to lead them against your people.
The.Avengers,"00:53:13,137","00:53:14,715","They will win him the Earth,"
The.Avengers,"00:53:14,847","00:53:16,639","in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract."
The.Avengers,"00:53:16,849","00:53:18,593",An army
The.Avengers,"00:53:18,810","00:53:20,470",from outer space.
The.Avengers,"00:53:20,687","00:53:23,095","So, he's building another portal."
The.Avengers,"00:53:23,315","00:53:24,643",That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.
The.Avengers,"00:53:24,774","00:53:25,770",Selvig?
The.Avengers,"00:53:25,942","00:53:28,267",- He's an astrophysicist. - He's a friend.
The.Avengers,"00:53:28,486","00:53:30,609","Loki has him under some kind of spell,"
The.Avengers,"00:53:30,780","00:53:32,274",along with one of ours.
The.Avengers,"00:53:32,490","00:53:34,068",I want to know why Loki let us take him.
The.Avengers,"00:53:34,200","00:53:35,481",He's not leading an army from here.
The.Avengers,"00:53:35,702","00:53:37,410",I don't think we should be focusing on Loki.
The.Avengers,"00:53:37,621","00:53:39,412",That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.
The.Avengers,"00:53:39,539","00:53:40,820",You could smell crazy on him.
The.Avengers,"00:53:41,041","00:53:42,784",Have care how you speak.
The.Avengers,"00:53:43,335","00:53:45,541","Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard."
The.Avengers,"00:53:45,963","00:53:47,042",And he is my brother.
The.Avengers,"00:53:47,256","00:53:49,130",He killed 80 people in two days.
The.Avengers,"00:53:50,009","00:53:51,005",He's adopted.
The.Avengers,"00:53:51,177","00:53:53,466",I think it's about the mechanics.
The.Avengers,"00:53:53,679","00:53:55,636",Iridium... What do they need the iridium for?
The.Avengers,"00:53:55,847","00:53:56,843",It's a stabilising agent.
The.Avengers,"00:53:57,015","00:53:58,296","I'm just saying, pick a weekend."
The.Avengers,"00:53:58,433","00:53:59,976",I'll fly you to Portland.
The.Avengers,"00:54:00,185","00:54:01,728",Keep love alive.
The.Avengers,"00:54:01,937","00:54:03,811",It means the portal won't collapse on itself
The.Avengers,"00:54:03,981","00:54:05,808",like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.
The.Avengers,"00:54:06,025","00:54:09,311","No hard feelings, Point Break. You've got a mean swing."
The.Avengers,"00:54:09,529","00:54:11,771","Also, it means the portal can open as wide"
The.Avengers,"00:54:11,990","00:54:14,397","and stay open as long, as Loki wants."
The.Avengers,"00:54:15,118","00:54:17,324",Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.
The.Avengers,"00:54:19,039","00:54:20,237",<i>That man is playing Galaga.</i>
The.Avengers,"00:54:21,291","00:54:24,659","He thought we wouldn't notice, but we did."
The.Avengers,"00:54:26,629","00:54:28,005",How does Fury even see these?
The.Avengers,"00:54:28,173","00:54:29,168",He turns.
The.Avengers,"00:54:29,466","00:54:31,090",Sounds exhausting.
The.Avengers,"00:54:32,177","00:54:33,339","The rest of the raw materials,"
The.Avengers,"00:54:33,553","00:54:36,341",Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily.
The.Avengers,"00:54:36,556","00:54:37,932",The only major component he still needs
The.Avengers,"00:54:38,141","00:54:41,641",is a power source of high-energy density.
The.Avengers,"00:54:41,854","00:54:45,104",Something to kick-start the Cube.
The.Avengers,"00:54:45,316","00:54:48,270",When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?
The.Avengers,"00:54:48,486","00:54:49,481",Last night.
The.Avengers,"00:54:49,986","00:54:53,190","The packet, Selvig's notes, the extraction theory papers."
The.Avengers,"00:54:53,407","00:54:54,403",Am I the only one who did the reading?
The.Avengers,"00:54:54,575","00:54:57,362",Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?
The.Avengers,"00:54:57,578","00:55:00,283",He would have to heat the Cube to 120-million Kelvin
The.Avengers,"00:55:00,498","00:55:01,957",just to break through the Coulomb barrier.
The.Avengers,"00:55:02,166","00:55:04,373",Unless Selvig has figured out how to stabilise
The.Avengers,"00:55:04,585","00:55:05,700",the quantum tunnelling effect.
The.Avengers,"00:55:05,920","00:55:06,916","Well, if he could do that,"
The.Avengers,"00:55:07,088","00:55:09,544",he could achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet.
The.Avengers,"00:55:09,758","00:55:12,165","Finally, someone who speaks English."
The.Avengers,"00:55:12,385","00:55:14,343",Is that what just happened?
The.Avengers,"00:55:14,554","00:55:16,546","It's good to meet you, Dr Banner."
The.Avengers,"00:55:16,764","00:55:19,801",Your work on antielectron collisions is unparalleled.
The.Avengers,"00:55:20,018","00:55:21,809",And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control
The.Avengers,"00:55:22,020","00:55:24,059",and turn into an enormous green rage-monster.
The.Avengers,"00:55:25,607","00:55:26,638",Thanks.
The.Avengers,"00:55:26,858","00:55:29,349",Dr Banner is only here to track the Cube.
The.Avengers,"00:55:29,569","00:55:30,850",I was hoping you might join him.
The.Avengers,"00:55:31,071","00:55:32,234",I would start with that stick of his.
The.Avengers,"00:55:32,364","00:55:33,395","It may be magical,"
The.Avengers,"00:55:33,532","00:55:34,813",but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.
The.Avengers,"00:55:34,950","00:55:37,987","I don't know about that, but it is powered by the Cube."
The.Avengers,"00:55:38,287","00:55:40,031",And I would like to know how Loki used it
The.Avengers,"00:55:40,247","00:55:41,825",to turn two of the sharpest men I know
The.Avengers,"00:55:41,958","00:55:43,748",into his personal flying monkeys.
The.Avengers,"00:55:44,126","00:55:45,668",Monkeys? I do not understand.
The.Avengers,"00:55:45,794","00:55:46,790",I do.
The.Avengers,"00:55:49,798","00:55:51,672",I understood that reference.
The.Avengers,"00:55:52,593","00:55:53,921","Shall we play, Doctor?"
The.Avengers,"00:55:54,136","00:55:55,844","This way, sir."
The.Avengers,"00:56:09,820","00:56:11,396",The gamma readings are definitely consistent
The.Avengers,"00:56:11,612","00:56:13,605",with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.
The.Avengers,"00:56:13,990","00:56:15,614",But it's going to take weeks to process.
The.Avengers,"00:56:15,825","00:56:17,023",If we bypass their mainframe
The.Avengers,"00:56:17,160","00:56:18,440","and direct route to the Homer cluster,"
The.Avengers,"00:56:18,661","00:56:21,746",we can clock this at around 600 teraflops.
The.Avengers,"00:56:22,916","00:56:24,873",All I packed was a toothbrush.
The.Avengers,"00:56:25,961","00:56:27,539","You know, you should come by Stark Tower sometime."
The.Avengers,"00:56:27,755","00:56:29,794","Top ten floors, all R&D."
The.Avengers,"00:56:30,132","00:56:31,591",You'd love it. It's Candy Land.
The.Avengers,"00:56:31,801","00:56:34,292","Thanks, but the last time I was in New York,"
The.Avengers,"00:56:34,512","00:56:37,049",I kind of broke Harlem.
The.Avengers,"00:56:37,264","00:56:39,091","Well, I promise a stress-free environment."
The.Avengers,"00:56:39,308","00:56:41,099","No tension, no surprises."
The.Avengers,"00:56:42,603","00:56:44,097",- Hey! - Nothing?
The.Avengers,"00:56:44,313","00:56:45,309",Are you nuts?
The.Avengers,"00:56:45,439","00:56:46,435",Jury's out.
The.Avengers,"00:56:46,565","00:56:47,680","You really have got a lid on it, haven't you?"
The.Avengers,"00:56:47,817","00:56:48,812",What's your secret?
The.Avengers,"00:56:48,943","00:56:50,402","Mellow jazz, bongo drums, huge bag of weed?"
The.Avengers,"00:56:50,570","00:56:51,684",Is everything a joke to you?
The.Avengers,"00:56:51,988","00:56:52,984",Funny things are.
The.Avengers,"00:56:53,114","00:56:54,857",Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship
The.Avengers,"00:56:54,991","00:56:56,236",isn't funny.
The.Avengers,"00:56:56,367","00:56:57,363","No offence, Doc."
The.Avengers,"00:56:57,494","00:56:58,988","It's all right, I wouldn't have come aboard"
The.Avengers,"00:56:59,120","00:57:01,956",if I couldn't handle pointy things.
The.Avengers,"00:57:02,082","00:57:04,654","You're tip-toeing, big man. You need to strut."
The.Avengers,"00:57:04,792","00:57:06,452","And you need to focus on the problem, Mr Stark."
The.Avengers,"00:57:06,586","00:57:08,080",Do you think I'm not?
The.Avengers,"00:57:08,212","00:57:11,000",Why did Fury call us in? Why now? Why not before?
The.Avengers,"00:57:11,132","00:57:12,876",What isn't he telling us?
The.Avengers,"00:57:13,009","00:57:14,753",I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.
The.Avengers,"00:57:15,387","00:57:16,632",You think Fury's hiding something?
The.Avengers,"00:57:16,763","00:57:19,930","He's a spy. Captain, he's ""the"" spy."
The.Avengers,"00:57:20,058","00:57:21,802",His secrets have secrets.
The.Avengers,"00:57:21,935","00:57:23,430","It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?"
The.Avengers,"00:57:26,023","00:57:27,815","I just want to finish my work here, and..."
The.Avengers,"00:57:27,942","00:57:28,938",Doctor?
The.Avengers,"00:57:34,364","00:57:36,737","""A warm light for all mankind."""
The.Avengers,"00:57:36,867","00:57:38,943",Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.
The.Avengers,"00:57:39,078","00:57:40,537",I heard it.
The.Avengers,"00:57:40,663","00:57:42,952",I think that was meant for you.
The.Avengers,"00:57:43,666","00:57:46,620","Even if Barton didn't tell Loki about the tower,"
The.Avengers,"00:57:46,753","00:57:47,832",it was still all over the news.
The.Avengers,"00:57:47,962","00:57:50,038","The Stark Tower? That big, ugly"
The.Avengers,"00:57:51,382","00:57:52,628",building in New York?
The.Avengers,"00:57:52,759","00:57:56,460","It's powered by an arc reactor, a self-sustaining energy source."
The.Avengers,"00:57:56,596","00:57:59,003","That building will run itself for, what, a year?"
The.Avengers,"00:57:59,140","00:58:00,967",It's just the prototype.
The.Avengers,"00:58:01,100","00:58:03,058",I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.
The.Avengers,"00:58:03,478","00:58:04,889",That's what he's getting at.
The.Avengers,"00:58:05,021","00:58:07,595","So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. Bring him in on the Tesseract project?"
The.Avengers,"00:58:07,732","00:58:09,476",What are they doing in the energy business
The.Avengers,"00:58:09,609","00:58:10,938",in the first place?
The.Avengers,"00:58:11,069","00:58:14,023",I should probably look into that once my decryption programme
The.Avengers,"00:58:14,156","00:58:16,314",finishes breaking into all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.
The.Avengers,"00:58:16,450","00:58:17,446",I'm sorry. Did you say...
The.Avengers,"00:58:17,576","00:58:19,569",Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge.
The.Avengers,"00:58:19,703","00:58:21,281","In a few hours, I'll know every dirty secret"
The.Avengers,"00:58:21,414","00:58:22,576",S.H.I.E.L.D. Has ever tried to hide.
The.Avengers,"00:58:22,707","00:58:23,702",Blueberry?
The.Avengers,"00:58:23,833","00:58:25,706",Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around.
The.Avengers,"00:58:25,834","00:58:28,669",An intelligence organisation that fears intelligence?
The.Avengers,"00:58:28,795","00:58:30,373","Historically, not awesome."
The.Avengers,"00:58:30,506","00:58:32,795",I think Loki's trying to wind us up.
The.Avengers,"00:58:32,925","00:58:34,503",This is a man who means to start a war
The.Avengers,"00:58:34,635","00:58:36,177","and if we don't stay focused, he'll succeed."
The.Avengers,"00:58:37,471","00:58:39,927",We have orders. We should follow them.
The.Avengers,"00:58:40,433","00:58:42,426",Following's not really my style.
The.Avengers,"00:58:43,645","00:58:46,017","And you're all about style, aren't you?"
The.Avengers,"00:58:46,147","00:58:47,179","Of the people in this room,"
The.Avengers,"00:58:47,315","00:58:48,893","which one is, A, wearing a spangly outfit,"
The.Avengers,"00:58:49,025","00:58:50,354","and, B, not of use?"
The.Avengers,"00:58:50,485","00:58:54,814","Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you."
The.Avengers,"00:58:57,533","00:58:58,565",Just find the Cube.
The.Avengers,"00:59:11,507","00:59:13,416",That's the guy my dad never shut up about?
The.Avengers,"00:59:13,884","00:59:16,672",I'm wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.
The.Avengers,"00:59:17,513","00:59:19,221",The guy's not wrong about Loki.
The.Avengers,"00:59:19,347","00:59:21,091",He does have the jump on us.
The.Avengers,"00:59:21,224","00:59:23,929",What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.
The.Avengers,"00:59:24,061","00:59:25,888",It's going to blow up in his face.
The.Avengers,"00:59:26,021","00:59:28,310",And I'm going to be there when it does.
The.Avengers,"00:59:28,607","00:59:30,766",Yeah. I'll read all about it.
The.Avengers,"00:59:32,904","00:59:34,184",Or you'll be suiting up with the rest of us.
The.Avengers,"00:59:35,782","00:59:39,365","You see, I don't get a suit of armour."
The.Avengers,"00:59:39,494","00:59:42,828",I'm exposed. Like a nerve.
The.Avengers,"00:59:42,956","00:59:44,699",It's a nightmare.
The.Avengers,"00:59:44,833","00:59:47,619",I've got a cluster of shrapnel trying every second
The.Avengers,"00:59:47,752","00:59:49,745",to crawl its way into my heart.
The.Avengers,"00:59:49,879","00:59:51,919",This stops it.
The.Avengers,"00:59:52,048","00:59:54,373","This little circle of light, it's part of me now,"
The.Avengers,"00:59:55,593","00:59:57,254",not just armour.
The.Avengers,"00:59:57,929","01:00:00,385",It's a terrible privilege.
The.Avengers,"01:00:00,724","01:00:03,096",- But you can control it. - Because I learned how.
The.Avengers,"01:00:03,227","01:00:04,222",It's different.
The.Avengers,"01:00:04,561","01:00:07,895","Hey, I read all about your accident."
The.Avengers,"01:00:08,023","01:00:11,357",That much gamma exposure should have killed you.
The.Avengers,"01:00:11,485","01:00:13,940",So you're saying that the Hulk...
The.Avengers,"01:00:15,405","01:00:17,778",The other guy saved my life?
The.Avengers,"01:00:18,283","01:00:19,398",That's nice.
The.Avengers,"01:00:20,285","01:00:24,070",It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?
The.Avengers,"01:00:25,374","01:00:27,284",I guess we'll find out.
The.Avengers,"01:00:29,003","01:00:30,663",You may not enjoy that.
The.Avengers,"01:00:30,797","01:00:32,754",And you just might.
The.Avengers,"01:01:31,985","01:01:33,360","<i>As soon as Loki took the doctor,</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:01:33,487","01:01:35,229",we moved Jane Foster.
The.Avengers,"01:01:35,363","01:01:37,735",They've got an excellent observatory in Tromsø.
The.Avengers,"01:01:37,865","01:01:41,400",She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday.
The.Avengers,"01:01:41,536","01:01:45,320","Handsome fee, private plane, very remote."
The.Avengers,"01:01:46,208","01:01:47,239",She'll be safe.
The.Avengers,"01:01:47,375","01:01:48,751",Thank you.
The.Avengers,"01:01:50,546","01:01:52,585","It's no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig."
The.Avengers,"01:01:53,590","01:01:56,164",I dread what he plans for him once he's done.
The.Avengers,"01:01:56,302","01:01:57,416",Erik is a good man.
The.Avengers,"01:01:57,553","01:01:58,549",He talks about you a lot.
The.Avengers,"01:02:00,431","01:02:02,423",You changed his life.
The.Avengers,"01:02:04,142","01:02:06,016",You changed everything around here.
The.Avengers,"01:02:06,145","01:02:08,268",They were better as they were.
The.Avengers,"01:02:08,856","01:02:10,932",We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced
The.Avengers,"01:02:11,066","01:02:14,767","but we come here, battling like bilge snipe."
The.Avengers,"01:02:14,904","01:02:16,731",- Like what? - Bilge snipe.
The.Avengers,"01:02:16,864","01:02:19,901","You know, huge, scaly, big antlers."
The.Avengers,"01:02:20,702","01:02:22,493",- You don't have those? - I don't think so.
The.Avengers,"01:02:22,620","01:02:24,494","Well, they are repulsive."
The.Avengers,"01:02:25,832","01:02:28,074",And they trample everything in their path.
The.Avengers,"01:02:35,758","01:02:39,092","When I first came to Earth, Loki's rage followed me here,"
The.Avengers,"01:02:39,221","01:02:41,546",and your people paid the price.
The.Avengers,"01:02:41,681","01:02:43,473","And now, again."
The.Avengers,"01:02:46,019","01:02:48,475","In my youth, I courted war."
The.Avengers,"01:02:50,232","01:02:52,225",War hasn't started yet.
The.Avengers,"01:02:53,361","01:02:55,152",You think you could make Loki tell us
The.Avengers,"01:02:55,279","01:02:56,559",where the Tesseract is?
The.Avengers,"01:02:56,696","01:02:59,947",I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.
The.Avengers,"01:03:00,075","01:03:04,784","It's not just power he craves, it's vengeance, upon me."
The.Avengers,"01:03:04,914","01:03:07,037",There's no pain would prise his need from him.
The.Avengers,"01:03:08,125","01:03:10,332",A lot of guys think that
The.Avengers,"01:03:10,461","01:03:11,955",until the pain starts.
The.Avengers,"01:03:14,257","01:03:15,751",What are you asking me to do?
The.Avengers,"01:03:15,884","01:03:19,467","I'm asking, what are you prepared to do?"
The.Avengers,"01:03:19,596","01:03:20,627",Loki is a prisoner.
The.Avengers,"01:03:20,764","01:03:23,088",Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat
The.Avengers,"01:03:23,224","01:03:24,802",that wants to be here?
The.Avengers,"01:03:37,406","01:03:40,490",There's not many people who can sneak up on me.
The.Avengers,"01:03:40,617","01:03:42,278",But you figured I'd come.
The.Avengers,"01:03:42,953","01:03:44,531",After.
The.Avengers,"01:03:45,414","01:03:48,830","After whatever tortures Fury can concoct,"
The.Avengers,"01:03:48,960","01:03:52,624","you would appear as a friend, as a balm."
The.Avengers,"01:03:53,589","01:03:55,249",And I would cooperate.
The.Avengers,"01:03:55,382","01:03:57,375",I want to know what you've done to Agent Barton.
The.Avengers,"01:03:57,509","01:03:59,502",I would say I've expanded his mind.
The.Avengers,"01:04:02,098","01:04:04,007","And once you've won,"
The.Avengers,"01:04:04,892","01:04:06,173","once you're king of the mountain,"
The.Avengers,"01:04:08,313","01:04:10,804",what happens to his mind?
The.Avengers,"01:04:12,067","01:04:13,858","Is this love, Agent Romanoff?"
The.Avengers,"01:04:13,985","01:04:16,821",Love is for children. I owe him a debt.
The.Avengers,"01:04:20,700","01:04:22,574",Tell me.
The.Avengers,"01:04:26,915","01:04:30,165",Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L. D... I...
The.Avengers,"01:04:32,588","01:04:36,502","Well, I made a name for myself."
The.Avengers,"01:04:36,634","01:04:39,635",I have a very specific skill set.
The.Avengers,"01:04:39,762","01:04:43,427","I didn't care who I used it for, or on."
The.Avengers,"01:04:44,433","01:04:47,932",I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar in a bad way.
The.Avengers,"01:04:49,104","01:04:52,022",Agent Barton was sent to kill me.
The.Avengers,"01:04:53,067","01:04:54,609",He made a different call.
The.Avengers,"01:04:56,570","01:04:59,607",And what will you do if I vow to spare him?
The.Avengers,"01:04:59,991","01:05:01,319",Not let you out.
The.Avengers,"01:05:01,451","01:05:03,325","No, but I like this."
The.Avengers,"01:05:04,245","01:05:07,662","Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man."
The.Avengers,"01:05:07,791","01:05:09,867",Regimes fall every day.
The.Avengers,"01:05:10,002","01:05:12,539",I tend not to weep over that. I'm Russian.
The.Avengers,"01:05:12,670","01:05:13,666",Or I was.
The.Avengers,"01:05:14,964","01:05:16,624",And what are you now?
The.Avengers,"01:05:17,091","01:05:20,046",It's really not that complicated.
The.Avengers,"01:05:20,178","01:05:24,258","I got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out."
The.Avengers,"01:05:25,267","01:05:26,809",Can you?
The.Avengers,"01:05:28,145","01:05:31,929",Can you wipe out that much red?
The.Avengers,"01:05:33,109","01:05:34,900","Dreykov's daughter,"
The.Avengers,"01:05:36,320","01:05:38,146","São Paulo,"
The.Avengers,"01:05:39,197","01:05:41,689",the hospital fire?
The.Avengers,"01:05:42,534","01:05:44,907",Barton told me everything.
The.Avengers,"01:05:45,037","01:05:48,121",Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red
The.Avengers,"01:05:48,249","01:05:50,740",and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself
The.Avengers,"01:05:50,876","01:05:52,252",will change anything?
The.Avengers,"01:05:52,378","01:05:55,048",This is the basest sentimentality.
The.Avengers,"01:05:55,173","01:05:57,415",This is a child at prayer.
The.Avengers,"01:05:57,550","01:05:58,831",Pathetic!
The.Avengers,"01:05:59,636","01:06:02,209",<i>You lie and kill</i>
The.Avengers,"01:06:02,347","01:06:05,383",<i>in the service of liars and killers.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:06:08,478","01:06:11,645","<i>You pretend to be separate, to have your own code,</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:06:11,773","01:06:14,478",<i>something that makes up for the horrors.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:06:15,652","01:06:18,060",<i>But they are part of you.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:06:18,196","01:06:21,981",<i>And they will never go away.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:06:22,576","01:06:26,076","I won't touch Barton, not until I make him kill you."
The.Avengers,"01:06:26,205","01:06:28,447","Slowly, intimately,"
The.Avengers,"01:06:28,582","01:06:30,955",in every way he knows you fear.
The.Avengers,"01:06:31,085","01:06:34,169",And then he'll wake just long enough to see his good work
The.Avengers,"01:06:34,296","01:06:37,747","and when he screams, I'll split his skull."
The.Avengers,"01:06:37,883","01:06:41,003","This is my bargain, you mewling quim."
The.Avengers,"01:06:42,596","01:06:44,174",You're a monster.
The.Avengers,"01:06:46,392","01:06:47,886","Oh, no."
The.Avengers,"01:06:48,770","01:06:50,347",You brought the monster.
The.Avengers,"01:06:53,358","01:06:54,936","So, Banner."
The.Avengers,"01:06:55,986","01:06:57,148",That's your play.
The.Avengers,"01:06:57,279","01:06:58,310",What?
The.Avengers,"01:06:59,280","01:07:00,940",Loki means to unleash the Hulk.
The.Avengers,"01:07:01,073","01:07:02,532",Keep Banner in the lab. I'm on my way.
The.Avengers,"01:07:02,658","01:07:03,738",Send Thor as well.
The.Avengers,"01:07:05,411","01:07:06,740",Thank you
The.Avengers,"01:07:06,871","01:07:09,030",for your cooperation.
The.Avengers,"01:07:16,548","01:07:18,007","What are you doing, Mr Stark?"
The.Avengers,"01:07:18,133","01:07:20,625",Kind of been wondering the same thing about you.
The.Avengers,"01:07:20,761","01:07:22,635",You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.
The.Avengers,"01:07:22,763","01:07:24,341",We are. The model's locked
The.Avengers,"01:07:24,473","01:07:25,754",and we're sweeping for the signature now.
The.Avengers,"01:07:25,892","01:07:26,886","When we get a hit,"
The.Avengers,"01:07:27,017","01:07:28,974",we'll have the location within half a mile.
The.Avengers,"01:07:29,102","01:07:33,349","Yeah, then you get your Cube back. No muss, no fuss."
The.Avengers,"01:07:33,482","01:07:34,597","What is ""Phase 2""?"
The.Avengers,"01:07:36,819","01:07:39,654",Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. Uses the Cube to make weapons.
The.Avengers,"01:07:39,780","01:07:41,524","Sorry, computer was moving a little slow for me."
The.Avengers,"01:07:41,657","01:07:44,362","Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract."
The.Avengers,"01:07:44,494","01:07:45,953",This does not mean that we're making...
The.Avengers,"01:07:46,079","01:07:47,075","I'm sorry, Nick."
The.Avengers,"01:07:47,205","01:07:49,494",What were you lying?
The.Avengers,"01:07:49,624","01:07:50,869","I was wrong, Director."
The.Avengers,"01:07:51,001","01:07:52,032",The world hasn't changed a bit.
The.Avengers,"01:07:52,169","01:07:53,200",Did you know about this?
The.Avengers,"01:07:53,336","01:07:54,664",You want to think about removing yourself
The.Avengers,"01:07:54,795","01:07:56,124","from this environment, Doctor?"
The.Avengers,"01:07:56,255","01:07:58,414",I was in Calcutta. I was pretty well removed.
The.Avengers,"01:07:58,549","01:07:59,712",Loki is manipulating you.
The.Avengers,"01:07:59,843","01:08:01,420","And you've been doing what, exactly?"
The.Avengers,"01:08:01,553","01:08:03,213",You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.
The.Avengers,"01:08:03,346","01:08:04,461","Yes, and I'm not leaving"
The.Avengers,"01:08:04,598","01:08:05,878",because suddenly you get a little twitchy.
The.Avengers,"01:08:06,016","01:08:07,640",I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.
The.Avengers,"01:08:07,768","01:08:11,468",Is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.
The.Avengers,"01:08:12,106","01:08:13,220",Because of him.
The.Avengers,"01:08:14,525","01:08:15,521",Me?
The.Avengers,"01:08:16,485","01:08:18,858","Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet"
The.Avengers,"01:08:18,988","01:08:22,154",who had a grudge match that levelled a small town.
The.Avengers,"01:08:22,282","01:08:24,489",We learned that not only are we not alone
The.Avengers,"01:08:24,618","01:08:28,201","but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned."
The.Avengers,"01:08:28,330","01:08:30,572",My people want nothing but peace with your planet.
The.Avengers,"01:08:30,708","01:08:32,665","But you're not the only people out there, are you?"
The.Avengers,"01:08:32,793","01:08:34,751",And you're not the only threat.
The.Avengers,"01:08:34,879","01:08:38,046","The world's filling up with people who can't be matched,"
The.Avengers,"01:08:38,716","01:08:39,915",that can't be controlled.
The.Avengers,"01:08:40,051","01:08:41,166",Like you controlled the Cube?
The.Avengers,"01:08:41,302","01:08:42,548",Your work with the Tesseract
The.Avengers,"01:08:42,679","01:08:45,253","is what drew Loki to it, and his allies."
The.Avengers,"01:08:45,390","01:08:46,766",It is a signal to all the realms
The.Avengers,"01:08:46,892","01:08:49,560",that the Earth is ready for a higher form of war.
The.Avengers,"01:08:49,685","01:08:50,765",A higher form?
The.Avengers,"01:08:50,895","01:08:51,891",You forced our hand.
The.Avengers,"01:08:52,021","01:08:53,017",We had to come up with something.
The.Avengers,"01:08:53,147","01:08:54,143",A nuclear deterrent.
The.Avengers,"01:08:54,274","01:08:56,266",Because that always calms everything right down.
The.Avengers,"01:08:56,401","01:08:58,773","Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark."
The.Avengers,"01:08:58,904","01:09:01,276","I'm sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck-deep..."
The.Avengers,"01:09:01,406","01:09:03,031",Hold on. How is this now about me?
The.Avengers,"01:09:03,158","01:09:04,273","I'm sorry, isn't everything?"
The.Avengers,"01:09:04,409","01:09:06,283",I thought humans were more evolved than this.
The.Avengers,"01:09:06,412","01:09:09,282","Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?"
The.Avengers,"01:09:09,415","01:09:11,289",You treat your champions with such mistrust.
The.Avengers,"01:09:11,417","01:09:12,876",Are you boys really that naïve?
The.Avengers,"01:09:13,002","01:09:14,875",S.H.I.E.L.D. Monitors potential threats.
The.Avengers,"01:09:15,003","01:09:16,284",Captain America's on threat watch?
The.Avengers,"01:09:16,421","01:09:17,417",We all are.
The.Avengers,"01:09:17,547","01:09:18,958","Wait, you're on that list?"
The.Avengers,"01:09:19,091","01:09:20,633",Are you above or below angry bees?
The.Avengers,"01:09:20,759","01:09:22,882","Stark, so help me God, if you make one more wisecrack..."
The.Avengers,"01:09:23,012","01:09:24,257",Threat! Verbal threat. I feel threatened.
The.Avengers,"01:09:24,388","01:09:26,879",- Show some respect. - Respect what?
The.Avengers,"01:09:34,232","01:09:37,150","<i>Transport Six-Six-Bravo, please relay confirm codes.</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:09:37,277","01:09:39,435","<i>I've got you on the computer, but not on the day log.</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:09:39,571","01:09:41,646",<i>What is your haul? Over.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:09:41,781","01:09:44,402",<i>Arms and ammunition. Over.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:09:52,751","01:09:54,957","You speak of control, yet you court chaos."
The.Avengers,"01:09:55,087","01:09:56,795","That's his M.O., isn't it?"
The.Avengers,"01:09:56,922","01:09:58,167","I mean, what are we, a team?"
The.Avengers,"01:09:58,298","01:10:01,253","No, we're a chemical mixture that makes chaos."
The.Avengers,"01:10:01,385","01:10:03,342",We're a time bomb.
The.Avengers,"01:10:03,471","01:10:05,297",You need to step away.
The.Avengers,"01:10:05,431","01:10:07,258",Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?
The.Avengers,"01:10:07,391","01:10:09,513",You know damn well why. Back off!
The.Avengers,"01:10:09,643","01:10:11,849",I'm starting to want you to make me.
The.Avengers,"01:10:11,979","01:10:15,597",Yeah. Big man in a suit of armour.
The.Avengers,"01:10:15,733","01:10:17,191","Take that off, what are you?"
The.Avengers,"01:10:17,318","01:10:19,643","Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist."
The.Avengers,"01:10:20,529","01:10:23,696",I know guys with none of that worth ten of you.
The.Avengers,"01:10:23,825","01:10:24,820",I've seen the footage.
The.Avengers,"01:10:24,951","01:10:27,193",The only thing you really fight for is yourself.
The.Avengers,"01:10:28,663","01:10:30,572","You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play,"
The.Avengers,"01:10:30,707","01:10:33,198",to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.
The.Avengers,"01:10:33,335","01:10:35,458",I think I would just cut the wire.
The.Avengers,"01:10:38,089","01:10:40,295",Always a way out.
The.Avengers,"01:10:40,425","01:10:41,670",You may not be a threat
The.Avengers,"01:10:41,801","01:10:43,710",but you better stop pretending to be a hero.
The.Avengers,"01:10:43,845","01:10:46,301",A hero? Like you?
The.Avengers,"01:10:46,431","01:10:48,471","You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers."
The.Avengers,"01:10:48,600","01:10:52,218",Everything special about you came out of a bottle.
The.Avengers,"01:11:17,505","01:11:20,340",Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.
The.Avengers,"01:11:21,342","01:11:24,794",You people are so petty and tiny.
The.Avengers,"01:11:24,930","01:11:25,925","Yeah, this is a team."
The.Avengers,"01:11:26,056","01:11:27,301","Agent Romanoff, would you escort"
The.Avengers,"01:11:27,432","01:11:28,547",Dr Banner back to his...
The.Avengers,"01:11:28,684","01:11:30,343",Where? You rented my room.
The.Avengers,"01:11:30,476","01:11:31,935",The cell was just in case...
The.Avengers,"01:11:32,061","01:11:33,603",In case you needed to kill me.
The.Avengers,"01:11:33,730","01:11:36,647","But you can't. I know, I tried."
The.Avengers,"01:11:39,361","01:11:42,278",I got low. I didn't see an end.
The.Avengers,"01:11:42,405","01:11:46,867","So, I put a bullet in my mouth, and the other guy spit it out."
The.Avengers,"01:11:47,453","01:11:48,651",So I moved on.
The.Avengers,"01:11:48,787","01:11:51,623",I focused on helping other people. I was good.
The.Avengers,"01:11:51,749","01:11:53,955",Until you dragged me back into this freak show
The.Avengers,"01:11:54,085","01:11:55,460",and put everyone here at risk.
The.Avengers,"01:11:55,586","01:11:57,661","You want to know my secret, Agent Romanoff?"
The.Avengers,"01:11:57,796","01:11:59,623",You want to know how I stay calm?
The.Avengers,"01:12:02,426","01:12:04,584","Dr Banner,"
The.Avengers,"01:12:05,387","01:12:06,716",put down the sceptre.
The.Avengers,"01:12:15,481","01:12:16,644",Got it.
The.Avengers,"01:12:17,484","01:12:18,479","Sorry, kids,"
The.Avengers,"01:12:18,610","01:12:20,353",you don't get to see my party trick after all.
The.Avengers,"01:12:20,487","01:12:21,483",You located the Tesseract?
The.Avengers,"01:12:21,613","01:12:22,609",I could get there fastest.
The.Avengers,"01:12:22,739","01:12:24,861",The Tesseract belongs on Asgard. No human is a match for it.
The.Avengers,"01:12:24,991","01:12:26,319",- You're not going alone. - You're gonna stop me?
The.Avengers,"01:12:26,451","01:12:27,446","Put on the suit, let's find out."
The.Avengers,"01:12:27,577","01:12:28,857",I'm not afraid to hit an old man.
The.Avengers,"01:12:28,995","01:12:29,991",Put on the suit.
The.Avengers,"01:12:32,874","01:12:34,499","Oh, my God."
The.Avengers,"01:12:50,017","01:12:51,012",Put on the suit.
The.Avengers,"01:12:51,143","01:12:52,423",Yeah.
The.Avengers,"01:12:55,189","01:12:56,932",<i>All hands to stations.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:13:01,070","01:13:02,861",<i>- Hill! - External detonation.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:13:02,989","01:13:04,234",Number three engine is down.
The.Avengers,"01:13:04,365","01:13:05,361",We've been hit.
The.Avengers,"01:13:05,491","01:13:06,654",- Can they get it running? - Fire in engine three!
The.Avengers,"01:13:06,784","01:13:07,780",Talk to me.
The.Avengers,"01:13:07,910","01:13:09,535",Turbine looks mostly intact
The.Avengers,"01:13:09,662","01:13:11,536",but it's impossible to get out there to make repairs
The.Avengers,"01:13:11,664","01:13:13,075",while we're in the air.
The.Avengers,"01:13:13,208","01:13:15,746","If we lose one more engine, we won't be."
The.Avengers,"01:13:15,877","01:13:17,870",Somebody's got to get outside and patch that engine.
The.Avengers,"01:13:18,004","01:13:19,712","<i>- Stark, you copy that? - I'm on it.</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:13:19,839","01:13:23,125","<i>Coulson, initiate defensive lockdown in the detention section</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:13:23,259","01:13:24,255",<i>then get to the armoury.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:13:24,385","01:13:25,500",Romanoff?
The.Avengers,"01:13:29,140","01:13:30,599",We're okay.
The.Avengers,"01:13:33,186","01:13:34,432","We're okay, right?"
The.Avengers,"01:13:47,034","01:13:48,232","- Keep that engine down! - Yes, sir."
The.Avengers,"01:13:48,368","01:13:50,076","Detention, wait for cameras to go dark."
The.Avengers,"01:13:50,204","01:13:51,995",- Got it. - Stay close.
The.Avengers,"01:13:53,749","01:13:55,243","Let's go, Level 4."
The.Avengers,"01:13:56,210","01:13:58,997",Engine three. I'll meet you there.
The.Avengers,"01:14:07,180","01:14:08,343",Doctor?
The.Avengers,"01:14:10,726","01:14:11,721",Bruce?
The.Avengers,"01:14:12,019","01:14:15,683",You got to fight it. This is just what Loki wants.
The.Avengers,"01:14:17,065","01:14:18,096",We're going to be okay. Listen to me.
The.Avengers,"01:14:18,233","01:14:19,228",Are you hurt?
The.Avengers,"01:14:22,529","01:14:24,735",We're going to be okay. All right?
The.Avengers,"01:14:24,865","01:14:27,617","I swear on my life, I will get you out of this."
The.Avengers,"01:14:27,743","01:14:29,118",You will walk away and never ever...
The.Avengers,"01:14:29,244","01:14:31,320",Your life?
The.Avengers,"01:14:47,847","01:14:48,842",Bruce.
The.Avengers,"01:15:25,719","01:15:28,878","Bring the carrier about to a 1-8-0, heading south!"
The.Avengers,"01:15:29,014","01:15:30,888",- Take us to the water! - We're flying blind.
The.Avengers,"01:15:31,017","01:15:33,009",Navigation's recalibrating after the engine failure.
The.Avengers,"01:15:33,144","01:15:34,886",Is the sun coming up?
The.Avengers,"01:15:35,646","01:15:37,852","- Yes, sir. - Then put it on the left."
The.Avengers,"01:15:37,981","01:15:39,641",Get us over water.
The.Avengers,"01:15:39,775","01:15:41,851","One more turbine goes down, and we drop."
The.Avengers,"01:15:44,113","01:15:45,393",Thanks.
The.Avengers,"01:15:48,743","01:15:49,906",Stark!
The.Avengers,"01:15:52,622","01:15:54,282","Stark, I'm here!"
The.Avengers,"01:15:54,416","01:15:55,910",<i>Good.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:15:57,127","01:15:59,120",<i>Let's see what we've got.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:15:59,254","01:16:00,913",I got to get this superconducting coolant system
The.Avengers,"01:16:01,047","01:16:02,043",back online
The.Avengers,"01:16:02,173","01:16:03,632","before I can access the rotors,"
The.Avengers,"01:16:03,758","01:16:05,585",work on dislodging the debris.
The.Avengers,"01:16:08,138","01:16:09,680",<i>I need you to get to that engine control panel</i>
The.Avengers,"01:16:09,806","01:16:13,471",<i>and tell me which relays are in overload position.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:16:25,781","01:16:27,324",<i>What does it look like in there?</i>
The.Avengers,"01:16:28,033","01:16:30,571",It seems to run on some form of electricity.
The.Avengers,"01:16:30,702","01:16:32,446","Well, you're not wrong."
The.Avengers,"01:17:36,270","01:17:39,106","We are not your enemies, Banner."
The.Avengers,"01:17:39,232","01:17:40,228",Try to think!
The.Avengers,"01:17:50,368","01:17:52,242","<i>Okay, the relays are intact.</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:17:52,370","01:17:53,829",What's our next move?
The.Avengers,"01:17:53,955","01:17:54,951","<i>Even if I clear the rotors,</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:17:55,081","01:17:57,288",<i>this thing won't re-engage without a jump.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:17:57,417","01:17:58,792",I'm going to have to get in there and push.
The.Avengers,"01:17:58,919","01:18:00,662","If that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded."
The.Avengers,"01:18:00,796","01:18:02,788",That stator control unit can reverse the polarity
The.Avengers,"01:18:02,923","01:18:04,334",long enough to disengage maglev and that could...
The.Avengers,"01:18:04,466","01:18:05,795",Speak English!
The.Avengers,"01:18:07,136","01:18:08,250",You see that red lever?
The.Avengers,"01:18:09,555","01:18:11,678",<i>It will slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:18:11,807","01:18:13,599",Stand by it. Wait for my word.
The.Avengers,"01:19:06,197","01:19:07,988",We need full evac on the lower hangar bay.
The.Avengers,"01:19:11,201","01:19:12,232",Grenade!
The.Avengers,"01:19:27,385","01:19:28,713",<i>We've got a perimeter breach!</i>
The.Avengers,"01:19:28,845","01:19:30,885",<i>Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. Gear.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:19:31,014","01:19:33,090",<i>Call-outs at every junction.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:19:40,398","01:19:42,604",<i>We have the Hulk and Thor on Research Level 4.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:19:42,734","01:19:44,276",<i>Levels 2 and 3 are dark.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:19:44,402","01:19:46,525","Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!"
The.Avengers,"01:19:47,739","01:19:48,735",Get his attention.
The.Avengers,"01:19:48,865","01:19:53,029","Escort 6-0, proceed to Wishbone and engage hostile."
The.Avengers,"01:19:53,162","01:19:54,442",<i>Don't get too close.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:19:54,580","01:19:55,955",<i>Copy.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:20:07,885","01:20:09,260",<i>Target acquired.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:20:13,557","01:20:14,553",<i>Target engaged.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:20:26,196","01:20:27,738","<i>Target angry, target angry!</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:21:36,142","01:21:38,349","They're not getting through here, so what the hell..."
The.Avengers,"01:21:56,747","01:21:58,989",<i>Engine one is now in shut-down.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:22:07,425","01:22:09,583",We are in an uncontrolled descent.
The.Avengers,"01:22:09,719","01:22:11,593","<i>Sir, we've lost all power in engine one.</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:22:12,138","01:22:13,965",<i>It's Barton. He took out our systems.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:22:14,099","01:22:16,590",<i>He's headed for the detention level.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:22:16,726","01:22:18,684",<i>Does anybody copy?</i>
The.Avengers,"01:22:19,854","01:22:21,977",This is Agent Romanoff.
The.Avengers,"01:22:22,106","01:22:23,565",I copy.
The.Avengers,"01:22:28,196","01:22:29,192","<i>Stark, we're losing altitude.</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:22:29,322","01:22:30,781","Yeah, I noticed."
The.Avengers,"01:22:59,812","01:23:00,843",No!
The.Avengers,"01:23:08,446","01:23:11,151",Are you ever not going to fall for that?
The.Avengers,"01:23:54,160","01:23:56,402",The humans think us immortal.
The.Avengers,"01:23:57,497","01:23:59,039",Should we test that?
The.Avengers,"01:24:01,835","01:24:03,033","Move away, please."
The.Avengers,"01:24:07,506","01:24:09,001",You like this?
The.Avengers,"01:24:09,967","01:24:13,218",We started working on the prototype after you sent the Destroyer.
The.Avengers,"01:24:14,430","01:24:16,672",Even I don't know what it does.
The.Avengers,"01:24:17,475","01:24:18,720",Do you want to find out?
The.Avengers,"01:24:20,729","01:24:22,188",No!
The.Avengers,"01:25:31,718","01:25:33,129",Natasha?
The.Avengers,"01:26:04,711","01:26:06,454",You're going to lose.
The.Avengers,"01:26:08,507","01:26:09,705",Am I?
The.Avengers,"01:26:11,009","01:26:13,500",It's in your nature.
The.Avengers,"01:26:15,681","01:26:18,006",Your heroes are scattered.
The.Avengers,"01:26:18,142","01:26:21,843",Your floating fortress falls from the sky.
The.Avengers,"01:26:21,979","01:26:23,603",Where is my disadvantage?
The.Avengers,"01:26:24,272","01:26:26,349",You lack conviction.
The.Avengers,"01:26:27,192","01:26:28,188",I don't think I'm...
The.Avengers,"01:26:35,034","01:26:36,744","So, that's what it does."
The.Avengers,"01:26:38,830","01:26:41,950",<i>All hands to crash stations immediately.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:27:09,570","01:27:10,566","Cap, hit the lever."
The.Avengers,"01:27:10,946","01:27:13,520",I need a minute here!
The.Avengers,"01:27:13,658","01:27:14,737",Lever
The.Avengers,"01:27:14,867","01:27:15,982",now!
The.Avengers,"01:27:27,963","01:27:29,078",<i>Help!</i>
The.Avengers,"01:28:04,710","01:28:06,085","Sorry, boss."
The.Avengers,"01:28:06,212","01:28:07,920",The god rabbited.
The.Avengers,"01:28:08,047","01:28:09,506",Just stay awake.
The.Avengers,"01:28:09,632","01:28:11,256",Eyes on me.
The.Avengers,"01:28:11,383","01:28:12,925","No, I'm clocking out here."
The.Avengers,"01:28:13,051","01:28:14,546",Not an option.
The.Avengers,"01:28:15,554","01:28:17,511","It's okay, boss."
The.Avengers,"01:28:19,433","01:28:21,473",This was never gonna work
The.Avengers,"01:28:21,602","01:28:22,883",if they didn't have something
The.Avengers,"01:28:24,230","01:28:25,772",to...
The.Avengers,"01:28:54,887","01:28:56,714",<i>Agent Coulson is down.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:28:58,098","01:28:59,806",<i>A medical team is on its way to your location.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:28:59,934","01:29:01,393",<i>They're here.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:29:04,605","01:29:06,229",<i>They called it.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:29:22,707","01:29:24,332",These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.
The.Avengers,"01:29:27,671","01:29:29,794",I guess he never did get you to sign them.
The.Avengers,"01:29:33,301","01:29:34,961",We're dead in the air up here.
The.Avengers,"01:29:35,094","01:29:38,179","Our communications, the location of the Cube,"
The.Avengers,"01:29:38,306","01:29:40,714","Banner, Thor..."
The.Avengers,"01:29:42,018","01:29:43,928",I got nothing for you.
The.Avengers,"01:29:44,062","01:29:46,980",I lost my one good eye.
The.Avengers,"01:29:50,027","01:29:53,028",Maybe I had that coming.
The.Avengers,"01:29:57,243","01:29:58,523","Yes,"
The.Avengers,"01:29:59,703","01:30:03,037",we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract.
The.Avengers,"01:30:04,500","01:30:06,409","I never put all my chips on that number, though"
The.Avengers,"01:30:06,543","01:30:09,580",because I was playing something even riskier.
The.Avengers,"01:30:13,551","01:30:17,679","There was an idea, Stark knows this,"
The.Avengers,"01:30:19,557","01:30:22,891",called the Avengers Initiative.
The.Avengers,"01:30:24,104","01:30:26,226",The idea was to bring together a group
The.Avengers,"01:30:26,355","01:30:28,893",of remarkable people
The.Avengers,"01:30:29,692","01:30:32,527",to see if they could become something more.
The.Avengers,"01:30:33,905","01:30:38,069","To see if they could work together when we needed them to,"
The.Avengers,"01:30:38,201","01:30:41,535",to fight the battles that we never could.
The.Avengers,"01:30:44,291","01:30:49,119",Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea.
The.Avengers,"01:30:51,465","01:30:53,126",In heroes.
The.Avengers,"01:31:01,225","01:31:02,767","Well,"
The.Avengers,"01:31:03,644","01:31:06,314",it's an old-fashioned notion.
The.Avengers,"01:31:26,626","01:31:29,117",<i>You fell out of the sky.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:31:43,144","01:31:44,638",Did I hurt anybody?
The.Avengers,"01:31:44,770","01:31:47,806",There's nobody around here to get hurt.
The.Avengers,"01:31:47,939","01:31:51,225","You did scare the hell out of some pigeons, though."
The.Avengers,"01:31:52,069","01:31:53,100",Lucky.
The.Avengers,"01:31:53,237","01:31:54,861",Or just good aim.
The.Avengers,"01:31:54,989","01:31:56,566",You were awake when you fell.
The.Avengers,"01:31:58,659","01:32:00,699",- You saw? - The whole thing.
The.Avengers,"01:32:00,828","01:32:02,453",Right through the ceiling.
The.Avengers,"01:32:02,580","01:32:06,530",Big and green and buck-ass nude.
The.Avengers,"01:32:06,668","01:32:07,782",Here.
The.Avengers,"01:32:09,170","01:32:11,329",Didn't think those would fit you until you shrunk down
The.Avengers,"01:32:11,464","01:32:13,872",to a regular-size feller.
The.Avengers,"01:32:16,219","01:32:17,499",Thank you.
The.Avengers,"01:32:18,513","01:32:19,758",Are you an alien?
The.Avengers,"01:32:20,348","01:32:21,546",What?
The.Avengers,"01:32:21,850","01:32:23,178","From outer space, an alien."
The.Avengers,"01:32:23,810","01:32:24,806",No.
The.Avengers,"01:32:25,186","01:32:28,306","Well, then, son, you've got a condition."
The.Avengers,"01:32:39,160","01:32:41,484",Clint. You're going to be all right.
The.Avengers,"01:32:44,831","01:32:46,908",You know that?
The.Avengers,"01:32:47,751","01:32:49,625",Is that what you know?
The.Avengers,"01:32:52,089","01:32:54,960",I've got no window.
The.Avengers,"01:32:55,760","01:32:57,136",I have to flush him out.
The.Avengers,"01:32:58,054","01:32:59,881",You got to level out. It's going to take time.
The.Avengers,"01:33:00,014","01:33:01,557",You don't understand.
The.Avengers,"01:33:03,518","01:33:06,768",Have you ever had someone take your brain and play?
The.Avengers,"01:33:07,564","01:33:11,727",Pull you out and stuff something else in?
The.Avengers,"01:33:14,904","01:33:17,277",Do you know what it's like to be unmade?
The.Avengers,"01:33:18,825","01:33:21,197",You know that I do.
The.Avengers,"01:33:28,794","01:33:29,825",Why am I back?
The.Avengers,"01:33:30,963","01:33:32,338",How did you get him out?
The.Avengers,"01:33:32,465","01:33:35,300",Cognitive recalibration.
The.Avengers,"01:33:35,426","01:33:38,130",I hit you really hard on the head.
The.Avengers,"01:33:38,262","01:33:39,341",Thanks.
The.Avengers,"01:33:43,642","01:33:45,386",Natasha...
The.Avengers,"01:33:46,062","01:33:47,141",How many agents did I...
The.Avengers,"01:33:47,271","01:33:48,730",Don't.
The.Avengers,"01:33:48,856","01:33:51,063","Don't do that to yourself, Clint."
The.Avengers,"01:33:51,651","01:33:53,359",This is Loki.
The.Avengers,"01:33:53,486","01:33:56,108","This is monsters and magic,"
The.Avengers,"01:33:56,239","01:33:57,864",and nothing we were ever trained for.
The.Avengers,"01:33:57,991","01:33:59,533","Loki, did he get away?"
The.Avengers,"01:33:59,659","01:34:00,655",Yeah.
The.Avengers,"01:34:00,994","01:34:03,235",I don't suppose you know where.
The.Avengers,"01:34:03,371","01:34:05,162",I didn't need to know.
The.Avengers,"01:34:05,289","01:34:07,033",I didn't ask.
The.Avengers,"01:34:10,295","01:34:12,786","He's going to make his play soon, though."
The.Avengers,"01:34:13,131","01:34:14,127",Today.
The.Avengers,"01:34:14,257","01:34:15,586",We got to stop him.
The.Avengers,"01:34:16,259","01:34:17,504","Yeah? Who's ""we""?"
The.Avengers,"01:34:17,636","01:34:19,593",I don't know. Whoever's left.
The.Avengers,"01:34:20,806","01:34:22,134","Well,"
The.Avengers,"01:34:23,851","01:34:26,009","if I put an arrow through Loki's eye socket,"
The.Avengers,"01:34:26,145","01:34:28,850","I would sleep better, I suppose."
The.Avengers,"01:34:31,692","01:34:33,269",Now you sound like you.
The.Avengers,"01:34:33,986","01:34:35,445",But you don't.
The.Avengers,"01:34:37,364","01:34:40,200","You're a spy, not a soldier."
The.Avengers,"01:34:40,326","01:34:45,071",Now you want to wade into a war. Why?
The.Avengers,"01:34:46,833","01:34:48,790",What did Loki do to you?
The.Avengers,"01:34:49,544","01:34:51,952",He didn't. I just...
The.Avengers,"01:34:55,717","01:34:57,258",Natasha.
The.Avengers,"01:34:59,345","01:35:01,338",I've been compromised.
The.Avengers,"01:35:04,434","01:35:06,557",I got red in my ledger.
The.Avengers,"01:35:08,688","01:35:10,765",I would like to wipe it out.
The.Avengers,"01:35:26,790","01:35:28,284",Was he married?
The.Avengers,"01:35:28,417","01:35:29,828",No.
The.Avengers,"01:35:29,960","01:35:34,172","There was a cellist, I think."
The.Avengers,"01:35:35,758","01:35:37,169",I'm sorry.
The.Avengers,"01:35:37,885","01:35:39,545",He seemed like a good man.
The.Avengers,"01:35:40,847","01:35:41,926",He was an idiot.
The.Avengers,"01:35:42,056","01:35:44,298",Why? For believing?
The.Avengers,"01:35:44,434","01:35:45,845",For taking on Loki alone.
The.Avengers,"01:35:45,977","01:35:47,685",He was doing his job.
The.Avengers,"01:35:47,813","01:35:50,351",He was out of his league. He should have waited.
The.Avengers,"01:35:50,482","01:35:51,512",He should have...
The.Avengers,"01:35:51,649","01:35:53,227","Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony."
The.Avengers,"01:35:53,359","01:35:55,482","Right, I've heard that before."
The.Avengers,"01:35:55,611","01:35:57,106",Is this the first time you lost a soldier?
The.Avengers,"01:35:57,238","01:35:59,030",We are not soldiers.
The.Avengers,"01:36:03,495","01:36:05,238",I'm not marching to Fury's fife.
The.Avengers,"01:36:05,372","01:36:06,535",Neither am I.
The.Avengers,"01:36:06,665","01:36:08,871",He's got the same blood on his hands that Loki does.
The.Avengers,"01:36:09,001","01:36:10,376","But right now, we got to put that behind us"
The.Avengers,"01:36:10,502","01:36:12,709",and get this done.
The.Avengers,"01:36:12,838","01:36:13,834",Loki needs a power source.
The.Avengers,"01:36:13,964","01:36:14,960",If we can put together a list...
The.Avengers,"01:36:15,091","01:36:16,086",He made it personal.
The.Avengers,"01:36:16,259","01:36:17,290",That's not the point.
The.Avengers,"01:36:17,426","01:36:19,798",That is the point. That's Loki's point.
The.Avengers,"01:36:19,928","01:36:21,837",He hit us all right where we live. Why?
The.Avengers,"01:36:21,972","01:36:22,968",To tear us apart.
The.Avengers,"01:36:23,098","01:36:24,972","Yeah, divide and conquer is great"
The.Avengers,"01:36:25,100","01:36:27,556","but he knows he has to take us out to win, right?"
The.Avengers,"01:36:27,686","01:36:29,229",That's what he wants.
The.Avengers,"01:36:29,355","01:36:31,846","He wants to beat us, he wants to be seen doing it."
The.Avengers,"01:36:31,983","01:36:33,097",He wants an audience.
The.Avengers,"01:36:33,818","01:36:35,478",Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.
The.Avengers,"01:36:35,612","01:36:38,529","Yeah, that was just previews. This is opening night."
The.Avengers,"01:36:38,656","01:36:41,195","And Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?"
The.Avengers,"01:36:41,326","01:36:42,904","He wants flowers, he wants parades."
The.Avengers,"01:36:43,036","01:36:46,819",He wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered...
The.Avengers,"01:36:48,583","01:36:50,160",Son of a bitch.
The.Avengers,"01:37:01,430","01:37:02,461",Time to go.
The.Avengers,"01:37:02,598","01:37:04,140",- Go where? - I'll tell you on the way.
The.Avengers,"01:37:04,266","01:37:05,262",Can you fly one of those jets?
The.Avengers,"01:37:06,852","01:37:08,097",I can.
The.Avengers,"01:37:11,982","01:37:13,013",You got a suit?
The.Avengers,"01:37:13,150","01:37:14,145",Yeah.
The.Avengers,"01:37:14,276","01:37:15,735",Then suit up.
The.Avengers,"01:37:43,389","01:37:44,670","Hey, you guys aren't authorised to be in here."
The.Avengers,"01:37:44,807","01:37:47,133","Son, just don't."
The.Avengers,"01:37:49,187","01:37:50,183",Sir.
The.Avengers,"01:37:50,313","01:37:51,511",Agent Hill.
The.Avengers,"01:37:52,065","01:37:53,607","Those cards,"
The.Avengers,"01:37:55,736","01:38:00,197","they were in Coulson's locker, not in his jacket."
The.Avengers,"01:38:04,620","01:38:06,197",They needed the push.
The.Avengers,"01:38:09,291","01:38:11,580",<i>We have an unauthorised departure from Bay 6.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:38:12,461","01:38:13,789",They found him.
The.Avengers,"01:38:14,630","01:38:18,331","Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do."
The.Avengers,"01:38:18,467","01:38:20,709","- I want eyes on everything. - Yes, sir."
The.Avengers,"01:38:34,275","01:38:36,018","<i>Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:38:36,152","01:38:39,984",<i>but the device is already self-sustaining.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:38:40,114","01:38:42,273","<i>Shut it down, Dr Selvig.</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:38:42,951","01:38:44,231",It's too late!
The.Avengers,"01:38:46,288","01:38:47,747",She can't stop now.
The.Avengers,"01:38:48,790","01:38:51,246",She wants to show us something!
The.Avengers,"01:38:51,377","01:38:53,416",A new universe.
The.Avengers,"01:38:53,545","01:38:55,088",<i>Okay.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:39:02,137","01:39:04,011",<i>The barrier is pure energy.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:39:04,139","01:39:06,013",<i>It's unbreachable.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:39:06,141","01:39:07,933","<i>Yeah, I got that.</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:39:09,144","01:39:10,140",<i>Plan B.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:39:11,313","01:39:13,390","<i>Sir, the Mark 7 is not ready for deployment.</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:39:13,524","01:39:15,766",Then skip the spinning rims. We're on the clock.
The.Avengers,"01:39:35,505","01:39:38,542",Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity.
The.Avengers,"01:39:39,676","01:39:42,048","Actually, I'm planning to threaten you."
The.Avengers,"01:39:42,179","01:39:43,638",You should have left your armour on for that.
The.Avengers,"01:39:43,764","01:39:45,175",Yeah.
The.Avengers,"01:39:45,307","01:39:46,386","It's seen a bit of mileage,"
The.Avengers,"01:39:46,517","01:39:49,138",and you've got the glow stick of destiny.
The.Avengers,"01:39:49,937","01:39:52,226",Would you like a drink?
The.Avengers,"01:39:52,356","01:39:53,471",Stalling me won't change anything.
The.Avengers,"01:39:53,608","01:39:55,730","No, no. Threatening."
The.Avengers,"01:39:55,859","01:39:57,234",No drink? Are you sure?
The.Avengers,"01:39:57,361","01:39:58,903",I'm having one.
The.Avengers,"01:39:59,947","01:40:03,861",The Chitauri are coming. Nothing will change that.
The.Avengers,"01:40:04,744","01:40:06,154",What have I to fear?
The.Avengers,"01:40:06,287","01:40:07,995",The Avengers.
The.Avengers,"01:40:10,083","01:40:12,408",That's what we call ourselves. We're sort of like a team.
The.Avengers,"01:40:12,544","01:40:14,168","""Earth's mightiest heroes""-type thing."
The.Avengers,"01:40:14,295","01:40:16,169","Yes, I've met them."
The.Avengers,"01:40:16,298","01:40:17,329",Yeah.
The.Avengers,"01:40:17,465","01:40:18,628","It takes us a while to get any traction,"
The.Avengers,"01:40:18,758","01:40:19,754",I'll give you that one.
The.Avengers,"01:40:19,885","01:40:22,090","But let's do a head count, here."
The.Avengers,"01:40:22,220","01:40:24,711","Your brother, the demigod,"
The.Avengers,"01:40:26,432","01:40:30,015","a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend."
The.Avengers,"01:40:30,145","01:40:33,312","A man with breathtaking anger-management issues,"
The.Avengers,"01:40:33,440","01:40:36,524","a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella,"
The.Avengers,"01:40:37,152","01:40:40,106",you've managed to piss off every single one of them.
The.Avengers,"01:40:40,239","01:40:41,235",That was the plan.
The.Avengers,"01:40:41,365","01:40:43,358",Not a great plan.
The.Avengers,"01:40:43,492","01:40:45,532","When they come,"
The.Avengers,"01:40:45,661","01:40:47,120","and they will,"
The.Avengers,"01:40:47,246","01:40:48,490",they'll come for you.
The.Avengers,"01:40:48,622","01:40:49,618",I have an army.
The.Avengers,"01:40:49,748","01:40:50,911",We have a Hulk.
The.Avengers,"01:40:51,416","01:40:52,792",I thought the beast had wandered off.
The.Avengers,"01:40:52,918","01:40:54,827",You're missing the point. There is no throne.
The.Avengers,"01:40:54,962","01:40:58,960",There is no version of this where you come out on top.
The.Avengers,"01:40:59,091","01:41:01,417","Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us,"
The.Avengers,"01:41:01,552","01:41:03,545",but it's all on you.
The.Avengers,"01:41:04,347","01:41:05,426","Because if we can't protect the Earth,"
The.Avengers,"01:41:05,598","01:41:08,718",you can be damn well sure we'll avenge it.
The.Avengers,"01:41:10,770","01:41:13,807",How will your friends have time for me
The.Avengers,"01:41:13,940","01:41:15,731",when they are so busy fighting you?
The.Avengers,"01:41:23,158","01:41:24,189",This usually works.
The.Avengers,"01:41:24,325","01:41:27,161","Well, performance issues, it's not uncommon."
The.Avengers,"01:41:27,287","01:41:29,196",One out of five...
The.Avengers,"01:41:30,666","01:41:33,580","Jarvis, anytime now."
The.Avengers,"01:41:35,337","01:41:38,089",You will all fall before me.
The.Avengers,"01:41:38,215","01:41:39,591",Deploy!
The.Avengers,"01:41:39,717","01:41:41,128",Deploy!
The.Avengers,"01:42:08,330","01:42:11,283",<i>And there's one other person you pissed off.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:42:12,417","01:42:13,662",<i>His name was Phil.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:42:37,442","01:42:38,937",Right.
The.Avengers,"01:42:39,069","01:42:40,314",Army.
The.Avengers,"01:43:52,687","01:43:53,968",Loki!
The.Avengers,"01:43:54,105","01:43:56,145","Turn off the Tesseract, or I'll destroy it."
The.Avengers,"01:43:56,274","01:43:57,306",You can't.
The.Avengers,"01:43:57,442","01:43:59,315",There is no stopping it.
The.Avengers,"01:43:59,443","01:44:01,235",There is only
The.Avengers,"01:44:01,362","01:44:02,477",the war.
The.Avengers,"01:44:02,613","01:44:03,728",So be it.
The.Avengers,"01:44:25,846","01:44:27,589","<i>Stark, we're on your three, headed northeast.</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:44:27,723","01:44:29,846",What? Did you stop for drive-through?
The.Avengers,"01:44:29,975","01:44:31,683",Swing up Park. I'm going to lay them out for you.
The.Avengers,"01:44:49,746","01:44:51,075","<i>Sir, we have more incoming.</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:44:51,206","01:44:52,949",Fine. Let's keep them occupied.
The.Avengers,"01:44:59,839","01:45:01,713",- Nat? - I see him.
The.Avengers,"01:45:46,053","01:45:48,260",We got to get back up there.
The.Avengers,"01:46:39,609","01:46:41,269","Stark, are you seeing this?"
The.Avengers,"01:46:42,028","01:46:44,483",<i>Seeing. Still working on believing.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:46:44,614","01:46:45,989",Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?
The.Avengers,"01:46:46,115","01:46:47,147",<i>Banner?</i>
The.Avengers,"01:46:47,283","01:46:48,315",Just keep me posted.
The.Avengers,"01:46:49,035","01:46:51,194","<i>Jarvis, find me a soft spot.</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:46:53,457","01:46:55,330",Look at this!
The.Avengers,"01:46:55,459","01:46:56,455",Look around you!
The.Avengers,"01:46:57,461","01:47:01,329",You think this madness will end with your rule?
The.Avengers,"01:47:01,465","01:47:02,959",It's too late.
The.Avengers,"01:47:04,468","01:47:05,713",It's too late to stop it.
The.Avengers,"01:47:05,845","01:47:09,711","No. We can, together."
The.Avengers,"01:47:16,313","01:47:18,436",Sentiment.
The.Avengers,"01:47:46,011","01:47:48,549",We've got civilians still trapped up here.
The.Avengers,"01:47:49,723","01:47:50,719",Loki.
The.Avengers,"01:48:02,360","01:48:04,152",They're fish in a barrel down there.
The.Avengers,"01:48:09,618","01:48:11,576",We got this. It's good. Go.
The.Avengers,"01:48:11,704","01:48:13,079",Do you think you can hold them off?
The.Avengers,"01:48:13,205","01:48:14,201","Captain,"
The.Avengers,"01:48:16,209","01:48:19,044",it would be my genuine pleasure.
The.Avengers,"01:48:45,906","01:48:47,614",Just like Budapest all over again.
The.Avengers,"01:48:48,242","01:48:50,733",You and I remember Budapest very differently.
The.Avengers,"01:49:06,886","01:49:07,882",It's going to be an hour
The.Avengers,"01:49:08,012","01:49:09,292",before they can scramble the National Guard.
The.Avengers,"01:49:09,430","01:49:11,222",National Guard?
The.Avengers,"01:49:12,183","01:49:13,677",Does the army know what's happening here?
The.Avengers,"01:49:13,935","01:49:14,931",Do we?
The.Avengers,"01:49:16,146","01:49:17,344",You need men in these buildings.
The.Avengers,"01:49:17,480","01:49:18,975",There are people inside and they're going to be running
The.Avengers,"01:49:19,107","01:49:20,305",right into the line of fire.
The.Avengers,"01:49:20,442","01:49:22,351",You take them to the basements or through the subway.
The.Avengers,"01:49:22,485","01:49:24,062",You keep them off the streets.
The.Avengers,"01:49:24,195","01:49:26,816",I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.
The.Avengers,"01:49:26,948","01:49:28,572",Why the hell should I take orders from you?
The.Avengers,"01:49:42,631","01:49:43,829",I need men in those buildings.
The.Avengers,"01:49:43,966","01:49:46,042",Lead the people down and away from the streets.
The.Avengers,"01:49:46,177","01:49:48,750",We're going to set up a perimeter all the way down to 39th Street.
The.Avengers,"01:49:59,148","01:50:00,726","Well, we got its attention."
The.Avengers,"01:50:00,858","01:50:02,732",<i>What the hell was step two?</i>
The.Avengers,"01:50:32,266","01:50:33,261",What's the story upstairs?
The.Avengers,"01:50:33,392","01:50:35,301",The power surrounding the Cube is impenetrable.
The.Avengers,"01:50:35,436","01:50:38,057",<i>Thor's right. We got to deal with these guys.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:50:38,189","01:50:39,813",- How do we do this? - As a team.
The.Avengers,"01:50:39,940","01:50:41,221",I have unfinished business with Loki.
The.Avengers,"01:50:41,776","01:50:42,807","Yeah? Well, get in line."
The.Avengers,"01:50:42,944","01:50:43,938",Save it.
The.Avengers,"01:50:44,069","01:50:45,397","Loki's going to keep this fight focused on us,"
The.Avengers,"01:50:45,529","01:50:46,560",and that's what we need.
The.Avengers,"01:50:46,697","01:50:48,357","Without him, these things could run wild."
The.Avengers,"01:50:48,490","01:50:51,444",We got Stark up top. He's going to need us to...
The.Avengers,"01:50:58,793","01:51:02,577","So, this all seems horrible."
The.Avengers,"01:51:03,047","01:51:04,162",I've seen worse.
The.Avengers,"01:51:04,716","01:51:05,712",Sorry.
The.Avengers,"01:51:05,842","01:51:08,512","No, we could use a little worse."
The.Avengers,"01:51:08,637","01:51:11,044","<i>- Stark, we got him. - Banner?</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:51:11,180","01:51:12,425",Just like you said.
The.Avengers,"01:51:12,557","01:51:15,262",Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you.
The.Avengers,"01:51:21,733","01:51:23,809",I don't see how that's a party.
The.Avengers,"01:51:31,660","01:51:32,656",Dr Banner.
The.Avengers,"01:51:34,413","01:51:36,205",Now might be a really good time for you to get angry.
The.Avengers,"01:51:37,250","01:51:39,704","That's my secret, Captain."
The.Avengers,"01:51:41,420","01:51:42,665",I'm always angry.
The.Avengers,"01:51:54,142","01:51:55,766",<i>Hold on!</i>
The.Avengers,"01:52:25,674","01:52:27,217",Send the rest.
The.Avengers,"01:52:33,974","01:52:35,219",Guys.
The.Avengers,"01:52:35,350","01:52:36,548","<i>Call it, Captain.</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:52:36,685","01:52:37,848","All right, listen up."
The.Avengers,"01:52:37,978","01:52:40,765","Until we can close that portal, our priority is containment."
The.Avengers,"01:52:40,898","01:52:42,226","Barton, I want you on that roof."
The.Avengers,"01:52:42,358","01:52:44,232",Eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays.
The.Avengers,"01:52:44,360","01:52:45,735","Stark, you got the perimeter."
The.Avengers,"01:52:45,862","01:52:47,024","Anything gets more than three blocks out,"
The.Avengers,"01:52:47,155","01:52:48,697",you turn it back or you turn it to ash.
The.Avengers,"01:52:48,823","01:52:50,021",<i>- Can you give me a lift? - Right.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:52:50,158","01:52:51,237","<i>Better clench up, Legolas.</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:52:54,829","01:52:57,202","Thor, you got to try and bottleneck that portal."
The.Avengers,"01:52:57,332","01:52:58,495",Slow them down.
The.Avengers,"01:52:58,625","01:53:00,783",You got the lightning. Light the bastards up.
The.Avengers,"01:53:03,087","01:53:04,712","You and me, we stay here on the ground."
The.Avengers,"01:53:04,839","01:53:05,870",We keep the fighting here.
The.Avengers,"01:53:06,007","01:53:07,003",And Hulk...
The.Avengers,"01:53:09,719","01:53:10,799",Smash.
The.Avengers,"01:54:04,401","01:54:05,515",Sir.
The.Avengers,"01:54:06,570","01:54:07,566",The Council is on.
The.Avengers,"01:54:12,451","01:54:15,701","Stark, you got a lot of strays sniffing your tail."
The.Avengers,"01:54:17,540","01:54:19,579",I'm just trying to keep them off the streets.
The.Avengers,"01:54:19,709","01:54:21,950","Well, they can't bank worth a damn."
The.Avengers,"01:54:22,085","01:54:23,248",So find a tight corner.
The.Avengers,"01:54:23,378","01:54:24,707",I will roger that.
The.Avengers,"01:54:47,695","01:54:48,858","Oh, boy."
The.Avengers,"01:54:55,870","01:54:57,495",Nice call.
The.Avengers,"01:54:57,622","01:54:58,820",What else you got?
The.Avengers,"01:54:58,957","01:55:01,744",<i>Thor is taking on a squadron down on Sixth.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:55:01,877","01:55:04,083",And he didn't invite me.
The.Avengers,"01:55:43,586","01:55:45,211","Captain, none of this is going to mean a damn thing"
The.Avengers,"01:55:45,338","01:55:46,583",if we don't close that portal.
The.Avengers,"01:55:46,714","01:55:48,374",Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.
The.Avengers,"01:55:48,508","01:55:50,750","Well, maybe it's not about guns."
The.Avengers,"01:55:52,679","01:55:54,636","If you want to get up there, you're going to need a ride."
The.Avengers,"01:55:55,724","01:55:56,803",I got a ride.
The.Avengers,"01:55:57,935","01:55:58,966","I could use a boost, though."
The.Avengers,"01:56:01,563","01:56:02,559",Are you sure about this?
The.Avengers,"01:56:03,023","01:56:05,562",Yeah. It's gonna be fun.
The.Avengers,"01:56:32,596","01:56:34,470","Okay, turn, turn."
The.Avengers,"01:56:34,598","01:56:36,340",Less! Less!
The.Avengers,"01:57:59,059","01:58:02,013","<i>Captain, the bank on 42nd past Madison.</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:58:02,146","01:58:03,889",<i>They've cornered a lot of civilians in there.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:58:04,023","01:58:05,932",I'm on it.
The.Avengers,"01:58:26,045","01:58:27,837",Everyone! Clear out!
The.Avengers,"01:58:57,745","01:58:59,405","<i>Director Fury,</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:58:59,538","01:59:01,330",<i>the Council has made a decision.</i>
The.Avengers,"01:59:01,457","01:59:04,209",I recognise the Council has made a decision.
The.Avengers,"01:59:04,335","01:59:05,913","But given that it's a stupid-ass decision,"
The.Avengers,"01:59:06,045","01:59:07,456",I have elected to ignore it.
The.Avengers,"01:59:07,588","01:59:10,922","<i>Director, you're closer than any of our subs.</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:59:11,050","01:59:12,046",<i>You scramble that jet...</i>
The.Avengers,"01:59:12,177","01:59:14,882","That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman."
The.Avengers,"01:59:15,013","01:59:17,089","Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,"
The.Avengers,"01:59:17,224","01:59:19,180",I will not order a nuclear strike
The.Avengers,"01:59:19,350","01:59:20,761",against a civilian population.
The.Avengers,"01:59:20,893","01:59:23,301","<i>If we don't hold them here, we lose everything.</i>"
The.Avengers,"01:59:23,438","01:59:26,190","If I send that bird out, we already have."
The.Avengers,"01:59:29,945","01:59:31,653",You.
The.Avengers,"01:59:33,907","01:59:35,070",Hawkeye!
The.Avengers,"01:59:36,535","01:59:37,531","Nat, what are you doing?"
The.Avengers,"01:59:38,454","01:59:39,450",A little help?
The.Avengers,"01:59:44,751","01:59:45,747",I got him.
The.Avengers,"02:00:12,321","02:00:13,317",Enough!
The.Avengers,"02:00:13,656","02:00:16,112","You are, all of you, beneath me!"
The.Avengers,"02:00:16,242","02:00:18,994","I am a god, you dull creature."
The.Avengers,"02:00:19,120","02:00:20,614",And I will not be bullied by...
The.Avengers,"02:00:30,466","02:00:32,339",Puny god.
The.Avengers,"02:00:40,475","02:00:41,934",The sceptre...
The.Avengers,"02:00:43,103","02:00:44,301",Doctor.
The.Avengers,"02:00:46,190","02:00:49,025",Loki's sceptre. The energy.
The.Avengers,"02:00:49,151","02:00:50,811","The Tesseract can't fight,"
The.Avengers,"02:00:50,945","02:00:52,984",but you can't protect against yourself.
The.Avengers,"02:00:53,114","02:00:54,110",It's not your fault.
The.Avengers,"02:00:54,240","02:00:55,485",You didn't know what you were doing.
The.Avengers,"02:00:58,536","02:01:00,695","Actually, I think I did."
The.Avengers,"02:01:00,830","02:01:03,785",I built in a safety to cut their power source.
The.Avengers,"02:01:05,001","02:01:06,411",Loki's sceptre.
The.Avengers,"02:01:06,544","02:01:09,117",It may be able to close the portal.
The.Avengers,"02:01:11,215","02:01:13,374",And I'm looking right at it.
The.Avengers,"02:01:25,356","02:01:29,223","<i>Sir, we will lose power before we penetrate that shell.</i>"
The.Avengers,"02:01:35,866","02:01:39,152","Jarvis, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?"
The.Avengers,"02:01:39,286","02:01:41,658",<i>I wouldn't consider him a role model.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:02:51,278","02:02:53,069",<i>Director Fury is no longer in command.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:02:53,196","02:02:55,235",<i>Override order 7-Alpha- 1- 1.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:02:55,364","02:02:57,938","<i>7- Alpha- 1- 1, confirmed. We're go for takeoff.</i>"
The.Avengers,"02:02:58,826","02:03:00,903","Sir, we have a bird in motion!"
The.Avengers,"02:03:01,412","02:03:03,405","Anyone on the deck, we have a rogue bird."
The.Avengers,"02:03:03,540","02:03:04,820",We need to shut it down!
The.Avengers,"02:03:04,958","02:03:07,164","Repeat, takeoff is not authorised."
The.Avengers,"02:03:37,700","02:03:39,859","Stark, do you hear me?"
The.Avengers,"02:03:39,994","02:03:42,117",You have a missile headed straight for the city.
The.Avengers,"02:03:42,664","02:03:44,039",<i>How long?</i>
The.Avengers,"02:03:44,165","02:03:46,242","<i>Three minutes, max.</i>"
The.Avengers,"02:03:46,376","02:03:48,001",<i>The payload will wipe out Midtown.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:03:48,128","02:03:50,167","Jarvis, put everything we got into the thrusters."
The.Avengers,"02:03:50,296","02:03:51,956",<i>I just did.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:04:04,853","02:04:06,182",<i>Package is sent.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:04:06,313","02:04:09,433","<i>Detonation in 2 minutes, 30 seconds, mark.</i>"
The.Avengers,"02:04:32,215","02:04:34,587",Are you ready for another bout?
The.Avengers,"02:04:35,260","02:04:36,291","What, are you getting sleepy?"
The.Avengers,"02:04:41,892","02:04:43,634",Right at the crown!
The.Avengers,"02:04:49,649","02:04:51,441",I can close it.
The.Avengers,"02:04:51,568","02:04:53,607",Can anybody copy?
The.Avengers,"02:04:53,737","02:04:54,851",I can shut the portal down.
The.Avengers,"02:04:54,988","02:04:57,028","<i>- Do it! - No, wait.</i>"
The.Avengers,"02:04:57,157","02:04:58,402","Stark, these things are still coming."
The.Avengers,"02:04:58,534","02:04:59,529",I got a nuke coming in.
The.Avengers,"02:04:59,660","02:05:01,569",It's gonna blow in less than a minute.
The.Avengers,"02:05:11,254","02:05:13,081",And I know just where to put it.
The.Avengers,"02:05:20,264","02:05:22,636","<i>Stark, you know that's a one-way trip.</i>"
The.Avengers,"02:05:22,767","02:05:24,142","Save the rest for the turn, J."
The.Avengers,"02:05:24,268","02:05:28,349","<i>Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?</i>"
The.Avengers,"02:05:28,481","02:05:30,521",Might as well.
The.Avengers,"02:05:32,444","02:05:34,816",<i>The streets of New York City have become a battleground.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:05:34,946","02:05:37,650",<i>The Army is here trying to contain the violence</i>
The.Avengers,"02:05:37,782","02:05:39,241","<i>but clearly, it is outmatched.</i>"
The.Avengers,"02:05:39,367","02:05:41,656","<i>And I have to say, in all my years of reporting,</i>"
The.Avengers,"02:05:41,786","02:05:44,704",<i>I have never seen anything like this.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:05:44,831","02:05:46,325",<i>We have limited information on the team</i>
The.Avengers,"02:05:46,458","02:05:50,206",<i>but we do know that billionaire Tony Stark's Iron Man...</i>
The.Avengers,"02:07:03,537","02:07:05,364","Come on, Stark."
The.Avengers,"02:07:12,004","02:07:13,119",Close it.
The.Avengers,"02:07:33,193","02:07:34,189",Son of a gun.
The.Avengers,"02:07:38,949","02:07:40,573",He's not slowing down.
The.Avengers,"02:07:58,635","02:08:00,094",Is he breathing?
The.Avengers,"02:08:27,957","02:08:29,368",What the hell?
The.Avengers,"02:08:32,087","02:08:34,210",What just happened?
The.Avengers,"02:08:34,339","02:08:36,628",Please tell me nobody kissed me.
The.Avengers,"02:08:40,930","02:08:42,590",We won.
The.Avengers,"02:08:44,934","02:08:46,213","All right, yay!"
The.Avengers,"02:08:46,351","02:08:48,308","Hurray. Good job, guys."
The.Avengers,"02:08:48,437","02:08:51,640",Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day.
The.Avengers,"02:08:52,524","02:08:54,102",Have you ever tried shawarma?
The.Avengers,"02:08:54,527","02:08:56,815",There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here.
The.Avengers,"02:08:56,946","02:08:58,606","I don't know what it is, but I want to try it."
The.Avengers,"02:08:59,031","02:09:00,490",We're not finished yet.
The.Avengers,"02:09:05,455","02:09:07,578",And then shawarma after.
The.Avengers,"02:09:29,229","02:09:31,471","If it's all the same to you,"
The.Avengers,"02:09:34,777","02:09:36,437",I'll have that drink now.
The.Avengers,"02:09:44,328","02:09:46,367",<i>Despite the devastation of what has been confirmed</i>
The.Avengers,"02:09:46,497","02:09:48,205","<i>as an extraterrestrial attack,</i>"
The.Avengers,"02:09:48,332","02:09:49,874",<i>the extraordinary heroics</i>
The.Avengers,"02:09:50,000","02:09:51,958",<i>of the group known as the Avengers</i>
The.Avengers,"02:09:52,086","02:09:53,628","<i>has been to many a cause not only for comfort,</i>"
The.Avengers,"02:09:53,754","02:09:54,750",<i>but for celebration.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:09:54,881","02:09:57,288",<i>It's just really great knowing they're out there.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:09:57,425","02:09:59,216",<i>That someone is watching over us.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:09:59,344","02:10:00,542","<i>I love you, Thor!</i>"
The.Avengers,"02:10:00,678","02:10:02,387",<i>And then these guys were like...</i>
The.Avengers,"02:10:02,514","02:10:03,842",<i>And then the air goes...</i>
The.Avengers,"02:10:03,974","02:10:05,349",<i>And this green guy walks up and he goes...</i>
The.Avengers,"02:10:05,475","02:10:06,507",<i>I don't know.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:10:06,643","02:10:09,098",<i>I don't exactly feel safer with those things out there.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:10:09,228","02:10:12,313",<i>It just seems that there's a lot they're not telling us.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:10:12,440","02:10:15,856",<i>Superheroes in New York? Give me a break.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:10:15,985","02:10:17,895","<i>These so-called ""heroes""</i>"
The.Avengers,"02:10:18,029","02:10:19,310",<i>have to be held responsible</i>
The.Avengers,"02:10:19,448","02:10:21,606",<i>for the destruction done to this city.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:10:21,742","02:10:23,865",<i>This was their fight. Where are they now?</i>
The.Avengers,"02:10:23,994","02:10:26,820",<i>Tough questions are being asked about the Avengers themselves.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:10:26,956","02:10:27,951",<i>Their sudden appearance</i>
The.Avengers,"02:10:28,082","02:10:29,457",<i>and equally sudden disappearance...</i>
The.Avengers,"02:10:29,583","02:10:32,371","<i>What, this is all somehow their fault?</i>"
The.Avengers,"02:10:34,421","02:10:37,588",<i>Captain America saved my life.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:10:39,718","02:10:43,218","<i>Wherever he is, and wherever any of them are,</i>"
The.Avengers,"02:10:43,347","02:10:44,841",<i>I would just...</i>
The.Avengers,"02:10:45,641","02:10:47,930",<i>I would want to say thank you.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:10:50,396","02:10:51,891",<i>Where are the Avengers?</i>
The.Avengers,"02:10:52,023","02:10:54,431",I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts.
The.Avengers,"02:10:54,567","02:10:56,726",I'd say they've earned a leave of absence.
The.Avengers,"02:10:56,861","02:10:58,439",<i>And the Tesseract?</i>
The.Avengers,"02:10:58,572","02:11:00,814",<i>The Tesseract is where it belongs.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:11:01,240","02:11:03,566",<i>Out of our reach.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:11:03,701","02:11:05,243",<i>That's not your call.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:11:05,370","02:11:06,401",I didn't make it.
The.Avengers,"02:11:06,537","02:11:08,779",I just didn't argue with the god that did.
The.Avengers,"02:11:08,915","02:11:10,706","<i>So, you let him take it</i>"
The.Avengers,"02:11:10,834","02:11:12,458","<i>and the war criminal, Loki,</i>"
The.Avengers,"02:11:12,586","02:11:14,294",<i>who should be answering for his crime.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:11:14,421","02:11:16,994",<i>I think he will be.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:11:30,479","02:11:33,148","<i>I don't think you understand what you've started,</i>"
The.Avengers,"02:11:33,273","02:11:35,729",<i>letting the Avengers loose on this world.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:11:36,277","02:11:37,272",<i>They're dangerous.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:11:37,403","02:11:41,068","<i>They surely are, and the whole world knows it.</i>"
The.Avengers,"02:11:41,616","02:11:44,189",Every world knows it.
The.Avengers,"02:11:44,619","02:11:46,695",<i>Was that the point of all this?</i>
The.Avengers,"02:11:46,829","02:11:48,573",<i>A statement?</i>
The.Avengers,"02:11:51,293","02:11:52,751",<i>A promise.</i>
The.Avengers,"02:12:01,469","02:12:03,011","<i>Sir, how does it work now?</i>"
The.Avengers,"02:12:04,139","02:12:06,131",They've gone their separate ways.
The.Avengers,"02:12:06,266","02:12:09,184","Some, pretty extremely far."
The.Avengers,"02:12:09,936","02:12:11,846","If we get into a situation like this again,"
The.Avengers,"02:12:11,980","02:12:13,523",what happens then?
The.Avengers,"02:12:13,649","02:12:14,645",They'll come back.
The.Avengers,"02:12:16,151","02:12:17,860",Are you really sure about that?
The.Avengers,"02:12:17,987","02:12:18,983",I am.
The.Avengers,"02:12:20,615","02:12:21,813",Why?
The.Avengers,"02:12:22,866","02:12:25,072",Because we'll need them to.
The.Avengers,"02:15:16,671","02:15:19,162",Humans.
The.Avengers,"02:15:20,466","02:15:24,796",They are not the cowering wretches we were promised.
The.Avengers,"02:15:25,764","02:15:27,922",They stand.
The.Avengers,"02:15:28,767","02:15:35,220","They are unruly, and therefore cannot be ruled."
The.Avengers,"02:15:42,197","02:15:45,068",To challenge them
The.Avengers,"02:15:45,200","02:15:48,901",is to court death.
