tt0317919,"00:00:38,872","00:00:40,123",Does that sound familiar?
tt0317919,"00:00:43,836","00:00:46,004",The Rabbit's Foot. Where is it?
tt0317919,"00:00:47,130","00:00:48,757",I gave it to you.
tt0317919,"00:00:48,882","00:00:51,885","Ethan, where's the Rabbit's Foot?"
tt0317919,"00:00:52,553","00:00:55,764",Wait... What are you saying? That wasn't it?
tt0317919,"00:00:56,348","00:00:59,518","- What I gave you, was that... - I'm going to count to 10."
tt0317919,"00:00:59,643","00:01:03,689",You're going to tell me where the Rabbit's Foot is or she dies.
tt0317919,"00:01:11,738","00:01:14,116","Jules, it's going to be okay."
tt0317919,"00:01:15,284","00:01:17,870",It's going to be okay. Do you understand?
tt0317919,"00:01:19,037","00:01:20,163",One.
tt0317919,"00:01:20,414","00:01:23,542",You listen to me. I got exactly what you asked for.
tt0317919,"00:01:23,667","00:01:25,919",Did you want something else?
tt0317919,"00:01:26,461","00:01:28,172","If there was a misunderstanding, I will fix it."
tt0317919,"00:01:28,297","00:01:30,174","I can get it, whatever you want."
tt0317919,"00:01:30,299","00:01:31,466",Two.
tt0317919,"00:01:31,967","00:01:35,012","Listen. Talk to me. We can talk,"
tt0317919,"00:01:35,345","00:01:36,889",like gentlemen.
tt0317919,"00:01:38,807","00:01:40,851",- Three. - God!
tt0317919,"00:01:50,027","00:01:52,654","All right. All right, all right."
tt0317919,"00:01:54,198","00:01:56,700",I know where the Rabbit's Foot is.
tt0317919,"00:01:57,910","00:01:58,994",I can help you.
tt0317919,"00:01:59,119","00:02:01,788",The way you helped me on the aeroplane?
tt0317919,"00:02:02,289","00:02:03,582",That way?
tt0317919,"00:02:04,082","00:02:06,585",You put the gun down. I'm not talking to you like this.
tt0317919,"00:02:06,710","00:02:09,129",That's your choice. Four.
tt0317919,"00:02:10,547","00:02:12,090",The Rabbit's Foot's in Paris.
tt0317919,"00:02:12,216","00:02:14,927",You want to know where in Paris? Then let her go.
tt0317919,"00:02:15,052","00:02:18,138",- 'Cause you will not... - It's not in Paris. Five.
tt0317919,"00:02:20,057","00:02:21,683",I can get it for you.
tt0317919,"00:02:21,808","00:02:23,685","But you kill her, you do this, you get nothing."
tt0317919,"00:02:23,810","00:02:26,021",- Six. - Are you listening to me?
tt0317919,"00:02:26,146","00:02:28,440",The only way you're going to get what you want is for you to...
tt0317919,"00:02:29,399","00:02:31,485",- Do you think I'm playing? - Son of a bitch!
tt0317919,"00:02:31,610","00:02:33,904",Do you think I'm playing? You don't think I'll do it?
tt0317919,"00:02:34,029","00:02:35,864",Where is it? Where the hell is it?
tt0317919,"00:02:35,989","00:02:37,407",- Look at me. - Where the hell is it?
tt0317919,"00:02:37,533","00:02:39,952",- Stay with me. - Seven! Seven!
tt0317919,"00:02:40,077","00:02:44,581",I am going to kill you. I swear to God I'm going to kill you!
tt0317919,"00:02:44,706","00:02:46,750","- Eight! - No, please."
tt0317919,"00:02:52,005","00:02:55,592",Please. Don't do this. Just let her go.
tt0317919,"00:02:57,219","00:03:00,514",I promise you. I promise you.
tt0317919,"00:03:00,639","00:03:03,100",- I can figure out how to get whatever... - Nine.
tt0317919,"00:03:04,476","00:03:06,603",Listen to me. Listen to me.
tt0317919,"00:03:08,272","00:03:10,065",I want to help you.
tt0317919,"00:03:10,357","00:03:12,901",I want to help you get whatever you want.
tt0317919,"00:03:13,026","00:03:16,697",But you got to do what's right. What you know is right.
tt0317919,"00:03:22,953","00:03:25,581",No. No.
tt0317919,"00:03:29,334","00:03:30,377",No.
tt0317919,"00:03:30,502","00:03:31,920",- Ten. - Don't!
tt0317919,"00:04:10,209","00:04:12,127",- What are you doing? - Your brother wants another one.
tt0317919,"00:04:12,252","00:04:13,879","Oh, God, no. Ethan, that's what we talked about..."
tt0317919,"00:04:14,004","00:04:15,964",- I'm watching him. He's fine. - That's how it is with Rick.
tt0317919,"00:04:16,089","00:04:18,634",He's fine and then suddenly he's naked and he's hugging everybody.
tt0317919,"00:04:18,759","00:04:21,595",- I'll take full responsibility for Rick. - You will? Full?
tt0317919,"00:04:21,720","00:04:24,181","- Well, mostly full. - It's a huge responsibility."
tt0317919,"00:04:24,306","00:04:25,849","It's going well, right?"
tt0317919,"00:04:25,974","00:04:28,268",- It's going really well. - Yeah.
tt0317919,"00:04:29,436","00:04:30,896","Julia, your sister's here."
tt0317919,"00:04:31,563","00:04:34,024",- Give me a hug. - You look so beautiful.
tt0317919,"00:04:34,149","00:04:36,193","I don't know about that. So, is this him?"
tt0317919,"00:04:36,318","00:04:38,946","- I hope so. - Oh, come here. Oh, gosh."
tt0317919,"00:04:39,821","00:04:41,615",All right. Mom's dying to see you.
tt0317919,"00:04:41,740","00:04:43,742",I can't believe you guys came all the way to Virginia.
tt0317919,"00:04:43,867","00:04:45,077",Like we'd miss your engagement...
tt0317919,"00:04:45,202","00:04:49,039","When Julia called and told me that she was getting married,"
tt0317919,"00:04:49,164","00:04:52,125","I had one thought, that it was just too bad"
tt0317919,"00:04:53,210","00:04:56,505",that Daddy wasn't here to walk her down the aisle.
tt0317919,"00:04:57,089","00:04:59,842","And then when Julia told me... Thanks, Mom."
tt0317919,"00:04:59,967","00:05:02,386","That Ethan doesn't have his parents anymore, either,"
tt0317919,"00:05:02,511","00:05:04,304",I got really sad.
tt0317919,"00:05:04,429","00:05:08,600",But it occurred to me that this is about starting a new family
tt0317919,"00:05:08,892","00:05:10,644",and how beautiful that is.
tt0317919,"00:05:10,769","00:05:13,897","And I just want to say I am making Julia an aunt,"
tt0317919,"00:05:14,022","00:05:16,817","so I expect the same treatment very, very soon."
tt0317919,"00:05:16,942","00:05:18,193",Cheers!
tt0317919,"00:05:23,907","00:05:25,200",Department of Transportation?
tt0317919,"00:05:25,325","00:05:27,494",I've been there over 10 years now. Wow.
tt0317919,"00:05:27,619","00:05:29,162",What do you do at the DOT?
tt0317919,"00:05:29,288","00:05:30,789",I study traffic patterns.
tt0317919,"00:05:30,914","00:05:33,208","You hit the brakes for a second, just tap them on the freeway,"
tt0317919,"00:05:33,333","00:05:35,169",you can literally track the ripple effect of that action
tt0317919,"00:05:35,294","00:05:36,795","across a 200-mile stretch of road,"
tt0317919,"00:05:36,920","00:05:38,213",because traffic has a memory.
tt0317919,"00:05:38,338","00:05:40,299",It's amazing. It's like a living organism.
tt0317919,"00:05:40,424","00:05:42,092","Freshen that up for you? What is it, vodka martini?"
tt0317919,"00:05:42,217","00:05:43,302",Yeah. Thanks.
tt0317919,"00:05:43,427","00:05:45,345","Ladies, do you need..."
tt0317919,"00:05:48,849","00:05:50,392","- I'd marry him. - I would, too."
tt0317919,"00:05:50,517","00:05:53,353","Okay, so, a three-week heli-boarding honeymoon?"
tt0317919,"00:05:53,478","00:05:56,356","- Okay, you actually get dropped... - From a helicopter, yeah."
tt0317919,"00:05:56,481","00:05:58,442",- It's how they met. - Really?
tt0317919,"00:05:58,567","00:06:00,402",- Tell her the story. - There's no story.
tt0317919,"00:06:00,527","00:06:02,112",It is a good story. Tell the story.
tt0317919,"00:06:02,237","00:06:05,282","First of all, no one was ever good enough for Julia."
tt0317919,"00:06:05,407","00:06:06,617","Oh, here we go."
tt0317919,"00:06:06,742","00:06:10,662","Not spontaneous enough, adventurous enough, funny enough..."
tt0317919,"00:06:10,787","00:06:13,540","You know what? No, that's not true. You make it sound like I've never dated."
tt0317919,"00:06:13,665","00:06:14,666",No one we liked.
tt0317919,"00:06:14,791","00:06:16,335",- That is true. - That is true.
tt0317919,"00:06:30,641","00:06:33,977",Then she goes and gets in a chopper that takes off from this lake...
tt0317919,"00:06:34,102","00:06:36,897",- What was the name of that lake? - Lake...
tt0317919,"00:06:37,898","00:06:40,359",Lake Wanaka. Wanaka.
tt0317919,"00:06:41,151","00:06:42,861",Wanaka. Thank you.
tt0317919,"00:06:44,029","00:06:45,697",- He heard that? - How did he hear that?
tt0317919,"00:06:45,822","00:06:47,783",And the hospital's cool with you taking three weeks?
tt0317919,"00:06:47,908","00:06:50,118","Yeah, I'm not the only nurse employed there, you know."
tt0317919,"00:07:16,562","00:07:18,856","I'm psyched that you're going to be my brother, man."
tt0317919,"00:07:18,981","00:07:19,982","So am I, Rick."
tt0317919,"00:07:20,107","00:07:21,942","No, it's awesome. I think it's going to be sick."
tt0317919,"00:07:22,067","00:07:24,444","Me, too, man. I just got to get the phone."
tt0317919,"00:07:24,570","00:07:26,405",- You rock hard. - Okay.
tt0317919,"00:07:27,489","00:07:28,532",Hello?
tt0317919,"00:07:28,657","00:07:30,742","<i>- Is this Mr Ethan Hunt?</i> - Yes, it is."
tt0317919,"00:07:30,868","00:07:33,328",<i>This is Ready-Travel Resort Services.</i>
tt0317919,"00:07:33,453","00:07:38,083",<i>We'd like to offer you a chance to win an all-expense-paid trip to Mexico.</i>
tt0317919,"00:07:56,768","00:07:58,770",We ran out of ice. I'll be back in 10 minutes.
tt0317919,"00:07:58,896","00:08:01,148","- Oh, no. Can't somebody else go? - No, I got it."
tt0317919,"00:08:01,273","00:08:03,192","I'll be right back. Hi, Betsy."
tt0317919,"00:08:03,317","00:08:04,651",Thank you.
tt0317919,"00:08:22,336","00:08:23,754",$1.86.
tt0317919,"00:08:33,347","00:08:37,142",Thanks for coming. Can't decide what size Slurpee to get.
tt0317919,"00:08:37,809","00:08:40,229",I usually go for the 900-ouncer.
tt0317919,"00:08:41,980","00:08:44,608",How's that party? Sorry I had to call you.
tt0317919,"00:08:44,733","00:08:46,693","- Yeah, you should have come. - You should have invited me."
tt0317919,"00:08:46,818","00:08:49,196",- You know I would have. - Thanks.
tt0317919,"00:08:51,698","00:08:54,785","I know we joke about it, but I am always this close to begging you"
tt0317919,"00:08:54,910","00:08:57,246",to stop training our people and get your ass back in the field.
tt0317919,"00:08:57,371","00:09:00,207","But that's not what you do anymore, and so I respect that choice."
tt0317919,"00:09:00,332","00:09:04,461",You know I do. Family's everything.
tt0317919,"00:09:06,713","00:09:09,049","Come on, John. What's going on?"
tt0317919,"00:09:12,970","00:09:14,721",It's Agent Farris.
tt0317919,"00:09:15,305","00:09:17,349",She was on an operation.
tt0317919,"00:09:18,058","00:09:21,478",She's disappeared. Been off-grid 11 hours.
tt0317919,"00:09:23,188","00:09:27,109",I'm sending in Search and Rescue. I was hoping you'd want in.
tt0317919,"00:09:31,905","00:09:34,283",You've got good people for that.
tt0317919,"00:09:37,327","00:09:39,913","Yeah. Yep, that we do."
tt0317919,"00:09:40,497","00:09:43,917",Wheels up at sunrise if you have a change of heart.
tt0317919,"00:09:44,501","00:09:47,254",Take some pictures of the party for me.
tt0317919,"00:10:06,982","00:10:08,692","<i>Ethan. Three days ago,</i>"
tt0317919,"00:10:08,817","00:10:12,279",<i>Agent Lindsey Farris was captured while on a surveillance operation.</i>
tt0317919,"00:10:12,404","00:10:15,115",<i>This is the man she was tracking. His name is Owen Davian.</i>
tt0317919,"00:10:15,240","00:10:16,533","<i>Details are eyes-only,</i>"
tt0317919,"00:10:16,658","00:10:19,411",<i>but I can tell you that Davian's a black-market trafficker.</i>
tt0317919,"00:10:19,536","00:10:22,414",<i>Extremely dangerous and a priority for us.</i>
tt0317919,"00:10:22,789","00:10:24,500","<i>At 1400 hours today,</i>"

tt0317919,"00:10:30,589","00:10:33,133",<i>They stopped at a derelict factory outside Berlin.</i>
tt0317919,"00:10:33,258","00:10:36,512",<i>It appears they have a hostage. We believe it's Agent Farris.</i>
tt0317919,"00:10:36,637","00:10:38,722","<i>Normally we would disavow,</i>"
tt0317919,"00:10:38,847","00:10:40,891","<i>but Lindsey may be the key to getting us closer to Davian,</i>"
tt0317919,"00:10:41,016","00:10:42,684",<i>and that's a risk we need to take.</i>
tt0317919,"00:10:42,809","00:10:45,521","<i>Your mission, should you choose to accept it,</i>"
tt0317919,"00:10:45,646","00:10:48,106",<i>is to find Lindsey and bring her home.</i>

tt0317919,"00:11:33,110","00:11:35,487",- You okay? - Yeah.
tt0317919,"00:11:37,364","00:11:38,615",Yeah.
tt0317919,"00:11:51,879","00:11:56,216","You know, I'm sorry. I realised I didn't tell you that the office called"
tt0317919,"00:11:57,134","00:11:59,511",during the party. I have to go to Houston for a night.
tt0317919,"00:11:59,636","00:12:03,515",METRO's having a public transpo conference.

tt0317919,"00:14:54,895","00:14:57,689",I don't respect you nearly enough to have that conversation.

tt0317919,"00:14:59,066","00:15:01,193",<i>but for now you're stuck with my voice in your head.</i>

tt0317919,"00:15:04,321","00:15:07,491","Who, Julia? You've never met her."
tt0317919,"00:15:07,616","00:15:10,118","Yeah, and the way things are, I probably never will."

tt0317919,"00:15:14,164","00:15:15,582",They've got communications gear.

tt0317919,"00:15:26,760","00:15:28,136","which means you'll need me in one, right?"
tt0317919,"00:15:28,262","00:15:29,847","Yeah, just about."
tt0317919,"00:15:29,972","00:15:32,266","Raider One, make a left at the top of the stairs."

tt0317919,"00:18:43,790","00:18:45,667","- Come on, come on. - I have to talk to you right now!"
tt0317919,"00:18:45,792","00:18:48,879",Just for you. Turn off your transmitter.
tt0317919,"00:18:50,005","00:18:51,548","Do it, Ethan!"
tt0317919,"00:19:02,017","00:19:03,227",Ethan!

tt0317919,"00:20:09,626","00:20:10,878",Enough.
tt0317919,"00:20:21,889","00:20:23,182",Now I'm out.

tt0317919,"00:21:38,340","00:21:40,467",Lindsey! Let's get to the chopper.
tt0317919,"00:21:40,592","00:21:42,094","Zhen, get rid of the truck."
tt0317919,"00:21:42,219","00:21:43,554",Let's go!
tt0317919,"00:21:50,185","00:21:52,938",God! What is that? You can't hear that?
tt0317919,"00:21:53,438","00:21:55,816",- Oh! God! - What's wrong with her?
tt0317919,"00:21:57,401","00:21:58,652",- Let's go! - We loaded?
tt0317919,"00:21:58,777","00:22:01,029",Yeah. Let's do it! Move out!

tt0317919,"00:22:30,142","00:22:31,894",- Son of a bitch. - No!
tt0317919,"00:22:32,019","00:22:35,355","Guys, we got company. I'm going to try and lose them."
tt0317919,"00:22:35,480","00:22:36,982",Hurts so much.
tt0317919,"00:22:38,192","00:22:40,444",Turn it off. Please.
tt0317919,"00:22:57,252","00:22:58,879","Please, Ethan."
tt0317919,"00:23:09,932","00:23:12,184","Guys, their missiles are hot!"
tt0317919,"00:23:16,939","00:23:18,690",Incoming! Hold on.
tt0317919,"00:23:30,118","00:23:32,454",Okay. That was lucky. We only get one of those.
tt0317919,"00:23:42,005","00:23:44,174",Do we have a defibrillator?
tt0317919,"00:23:46,343","00:23:48,095","Ethan, turn it off!"
tt0317919,"00:23:48,595","00:23:50,055",Bring it on!
tt0317919,"00:23:52,683","00:23:55,352",Ethan! What is it? Did they put something in my head?
tt0317919,"00:23:55,477","00:23:57,396",They injected you with a time-release charge.
tt0317919,"00:23:57,521","00:23:59,022",- Do you remember that? - No. Time-release...
tt0317919,"00:23:59,147","00:24:00,482",An explosive. They've activated it.
tt0317919,"00:24:00,607","00:24:01,984","It's gonna detonate unless we fry the charge,"
tt0317919,"00:24:02,109","00:24:03,277","- which is what we're gonna do. - No, Ethan."
tt0317919,"00:24:03,402","00:24:04,736","Zap her like that, you'll stop her heart."
tt0317919,"00:24:04,862","00:24:07,406",Then I'll zap her again and bring her back.
tt0317919,"00:24:07,531","00:24:08,615",Do it!
tt0317919,"00:24:08,740","00:24:10,826",Guys! They're firing another one!
tt0317919,"00:24:18,625","00:24:20,252",- Ethan! - Zhen!
tt0317919,"00:24:20,377","00:24:22,838","Zhen, hold on. Hold on, hold on!"
tt0317919,"00:24:45,861","00:24:47,529",- I want you to set it for 150. - 150.
tt0317919,"00:24:47,654","00:24:49,364","Lindsey, I'm gonna short out the explosive in your head."
tt0317919,"00:24:49,489","00:24:51,450",- You're gonna be okay. - It'll need 30 seconds.
tt0317919,"00:24:52,743","00:24:54,036",Damn it.
tt0317919,"00:24:54,536","00:24:56,330",- Twenty-five seconds! - Come on.
tt0317919,"00:24:56,455","00:24:58,248",We're almost there.
tt0317919,"00:25:01,835","00:25:03,837",- They have us locked. - Twenty seconds.
tt0317919,"00:25:05,506","00:25:06,757",Hold on.
tt0317919,"00:25:23,899","00:25:25,108",I got them!
tt0317919,"00:25:25,234","00:25:26,818",- Ten seconds. - Almost there. Almost there.
tt0317919,"00:25:27,861","00:25:29,363",Give me the paddles.
tt0317919,"00:25:29,488","00:25:31,949",Ethan. Thank you.
tt0317919,"00:26:07,025","00:26:08,235",Shit.
tt0317919,"00:26:45,397","00:26:46,481",Hey.
tt0317919,"00:26:48,233","00:26:49,359",Hey.
tt0317919,"00:26:56,992","00:26:58,494",How did it go?
tt0317919,"00:27:01,413","00:27:05,000",I'm sorry. Fine. I'm sorry.
tt0317919,"00:27:05,626","00:27:07,211",I'm just tired.
tt0317919,"00:27:36,198","00:27:38,826",I read your training brief on Agent Farris.
tt0317919,"00:27:38,951","00:27:41,370","The words you used were ""beyond capable."""
tt0317919,"00:27:41,495","00:27:42,830","That still stand, Mr Hunt?"
tt0317919,"00:27:42,955","00:27:45,290",- Mr Brassel... - Does it stand?
tt0317919,"00:27:46,083","00:27:47,251","Yes, sir, it does."
tt0317919,"00:27:47,376","00:27:50,587",Because we've got a corpse downstairs that says otherwise.
tt0317919,"00:27:50,712","00:27:52,381",Killed by a detonator
tt0317919,"00:27:52,506","00:27:55,717",implanted in her skull through the nasal cavity.
tt0317919,"00:27:56,885","00:28:00,013","Mr Brassel, it's unacceptable to judge Agent Farris' competence based..."
tt0317919,"00:28:00,138","00:28:02,224","It's unacceptable that chocolate makes you fat,"
tt0317919,"00:28:02,349","00:28:04,351",but I've eaten my share. And guess what?
tt0317919,"00:28:04,476","00:28:06,812","Now, I approved Agent Farris' surveillance op"
tt0317919,"00:28:06,937","00:28:09,064","based on your evaluations, Mr Hunt,"
tt0317919,"00:28:09,189","00:28:11,567",of a woman who allowed herself to be captured.
tt0317919,"00:28:11,692","00:28:14,653",So you go to recover her. You encounter a dozen men.
tt0317919,"00:28:14,778","00:28:16,405",You don't grab any of them?
tt0317919,"00:28:16,530","00:28:20,159","Our objective, Mr Brassel, was to recover Agent Farris."
tt0317919,"00:28:21,118","00:28:23,245",Davian employs a cellular structure at his organisation.
tt0317919,"00:28:23,370","00:28:25,414",The men there more than likely had no information...
tt0317919,"00:28:25,539","00:28:28,542",Who's drawing these conclusions? Is it you?
tt0317919,"00:28:28,667","00:28:31,795","- I am, sir. Based upon... - I'm not on you yet."
tt0317919,"00:28:32,546","00:28:35,007",You allowed Farris to board your chopper without a scan.
tt0317919,"00:28:35,132","00:28:37,176",That explosive device could have taken you all out.
tt0317919,"00:28:37,301","00:28:41,763","There is one reason that you are sitting here before me today, and that is luck."
tt0317919,"00:28:41,889","00:28:46,143",Because your operation was poorly conceived and executed worse.
tt0317919,"00:28:46,268","00:28:48,562",- Two laptops were recovered... - I'm aware of that.
tt0317919,"00:28:48,687","00:28:50,022",We've talked to Tech Services.
tt0317919,"00:28:50,147","00:28:52,482",They doubt if they can reconstitute the drives.
tt0317919,"00:28:52,608","00:28:55,861","""Crispy,"" I believe, is what they called them. Worthless."
tt0317919,"00:28:55,986","00:28:58,238","Mr Brassel, as Operation Manager of this office,"
tt0317919,"00:28:58,363","00:28:59,781",- I have the authority... - Excuse me.
tt0317919,"00:28:59,907","00:29:02,951","Did you just throw a title at me, Mr Musgrave?"
tt0317919,"00:29:03,076","00:29:06,413",I don't care if your daddy plays golf with the President.
tt0317919,"00:29:06,538","00:29:09,625",This is Intelligence. So far I haven't seen any.
tt0317919,"00:29:09,750","00:29:12,878","You think this op was worth the risk, Mr Hunt."
tt0317919,"00:29:13,837","00:29:16,423",What do you know about Owen Davian?
tt0317919,"00:29:17,508","00:29:20,010",He was the one who brought gas centrifuge technology
tt0317919,"00:29:20,135","00:29:22,179",to Korea from Pakistan.
tt0317919,"00:29:22,304","00:29:26,475",He was also the man who sold Toxin Five to the Armahad Republic Jihad.

tt0317919,"00:29:32,481","00:29:36,151",And he remains invisible. He's a goddamn invisible man.
tt0317919,"00:29:36,276","00:29:39,196","Wells, not Ellison, in case you want to be cute again."
tt0317919,"00:29:39,321","00:29:41,073",We can't find him.
tt0317919,"00:29:42,241","00:29:45,661",He knows it. It's emboldened him.
tt0317919,"00:29:46,995","00:29:49,540",I've been trying to bring Davian down since the day that I got here.
tt0317919,"00:29:49,665","00:29:50,833",Do you know what I've got for it?
tt0317919,"00:29:50,958","00:29:53,168",It's never been confirmed the Toxin Five theft was Davian.
tt0317919,"00:29:53,293","00:29:57,297","Mr Musgrave, please don't interrupt me when I'm asking rhetorical questions."
tt0317919,"00:29:57,422","00:29:59,508",Your operation has achieved one thing.
tt0317919,"00:29:59,633","00:30:02,845",You have reminded Davian that he is winning.
tt0317919,"00:30:04,346","00:30:07,307","And now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go inform Mr and Mrs Farris"
tt0317919,"00:30:07,432","00:30:11,311",that their baby girl was killed in a head-on collision on I-95.
tt0317919,"00:30:13,397","00:30:15,899",<i>I stand here today deeply saddened</i>
tt0317919,"00:30:16,233","00:30:18,986","by the death of one of God's children,"

tt0317919,"00:30:22,573","00:30:27,369",It is always startling when the Lord takes one of our young so unexpectedly.

tt0317919,"00:31:10,162","00:31:11,246",Yes?
tt0317919,"00:31:11,663","00:31:13,415",<i>Is this Mr Kelvin?</i>
tt0317919,"00:31:16,084","00:31:17,836",Yes. Who is this?
tt0317919,"00:31:18,420","00:31:20,255",<i>I'm calling from Norfolk Mail Service.</i>
tt0317919,"00:31:20,380","00:31:22,799",<i>Lindsey Farris rents a post office box here.</i>
tt0317919,"00:31:22,925","00:31:24,510",<i>She sent you a piece of mail from Berlin</i>
tt0317919,"00:31:24,635","00:31:26,512",<i>and asked us to call you when it arrived.</i>
tt0317919,"00:31:26,637","00:31:28,514",<i>It came this morning.</i>
tt0317919,"00:31:32,851","00:31:34,228",Thank you.
tt0317919,"00:31:38,023","00:31:40,108",- This right here. - Thanks.
tt0317919,"00:31:57,543","00:31:58,877",<i>It's a microdot.</i>
tt0317919,"00:31:58,961","00:32:01,213",A microdot with nothing on it. This is unusual.
tt0317919,"00:32:01,338","00:32:03,340",Lindsey wouldn't send me a blank microdot.
tt0317919,"00:32:03,465","00:32:05,008","I'm telling you, man, there's no image."
tt0317919,"00:32:05,133","00:32:06,426",Then you're not looking in the right place.
tt0317919,"00:32:06,552","00:32:08,011",Where the hell am I supposed to look?
tt0317919,"00:32:08,136","00:32:09,555",There's not much square footage to this thing.
tt0317919,"00:32:09,680","00:32:11,098",Why would Lindsey send me a blank microdot?
tt0317919,"00:32:11,223","00:32:12,975",I don't know. Why would Lindsey send you anything?
tt0317919,"00:32:13,100","00:32:15,769","You were her instructor, not her handler."
tt0317919,"00:32:16,478","00:32:19,481","Listen, man. I don't mean to cross the line,"
tt0317919,"00:32:20,315","00:32:23,527",but was there something going on between you two?
tt0317919,"00:32:23,652","00:32:25,320",You and Lindsey.
tt0317919,"00:32:25,863","00:32:28,365",Lindsey was like my little sister.
tt0317919,"00:32:28,949","00:32:30,409",And you never
tt0317919,"00:32:31,451","00:32:34,246","slept with your little sister, right?"
tt0317919,"00:32:37,291","00:32:40,002","Hey, brother, if I don't ask you, who will?"
tt0317919,"00:32:40,127","00:32:42,629",Maybe it's magnetic. The microdot.
tt0317919,"00:32:43,463","00:32:45,132","Well, that's old school."
tt0317919,"00:32:45,257","00:32:48,719","If she was in a hurry and only had access to black-market gear, maybe."
tt0317919,"00:32:48,844","00:32:51,054",- Could you get the tools to read it? - I might know a guy.
tt0317919,"00:32:51,180","00:32:53,557","- Magnetic means encrypted. - Yeah, I know that."
tt0317919,"00:32:53,682","00:32:56,351",Yeah. Be right there.
tt0317919,"00:32:56,810","00:32:59,646",The thing about Lindsey is she was brand-new.
tt0317919,"00:32:59,771","00:33:02,900",She was sweet. Remember when you were sweet?
tt0317919,"00:33:03,025","00:33:06,528","- Can you remember that far back? - Yeah, well, barely."
tt0317919,"00:33:06,945","00:33:10,407","In Germany, you asked me what it is I see in Julia."
tt0317919,"00:33:10,908","00:33:13,952",What I see in Julia is life before all this.
tt0317919,"00:33:14,745","00:33:16,413",And it's good.
tt0317919,"00:33:18,749","00:33:20,167","Benji, what have you got?"
tt0317919,"00:33:20,292","00:33:22,503","Well, these hard drive platters are just fried."
tt0317919,"00:33:22,628","00:33:24,379","- Yeah. - You know, they made a mess of them."
tt0317919,"00:33:24,505","00:33:25,881",It's just like... There's holes in them and stuff.
tt0317919,"00:33:26,006","00:33:27,883",And it's got scorched all the way through. And then...
tt0317919,"00:33:28,008","00:33:29,551","Look, this one's got a hole in it and stuff."
tt0317919,"00:33:29,676","00:33:30,928",I can't believe. I can't even look at it.
tt0317919,"00:33:31,053","00:33:33,222",- Benji. Did you recover anything? - Yes. Yes.
tt0317919,"00:33:33,347","00:33:36,225","Despite the aforementioned conditions of the hard drive you brought back,"
tt0317919,"00:33:36,350","00:33:40,896",I managed to recover portions of two dozen e-mail files.
tt0317919,"00:33:41,021","00:33:42,523",Also made what I believe to be
tt0317919,"00:33:42,648","00:33:45,609",a thoroughly promotion-worthy breakthrough.
tt0317919,"00:33:46,485","00:33:49,488",Your Mr Davian is going to arrive in Rome the day after tomorrow
tt0317919,"00:33:49,613","00:33:52,658",and attend a function at one Vatican City.
tt0317919,"00:33:52,783","00:33:54,910",What the hell is Davian doing at the Vatican?
tt0317919,"00:33:55,035","00:33:57,037","It's all got to do with the ""Rabbit's Foot."""
tt0317919,"00:33:57,162","00:33:58,247",Rabbit's Foot?
tt0317919,"00:33:58,372","00:34:00,040","Yeah, well, I'm assuming it's like a code word"
tt0317919,"00:34:00,165","00:34:02,292","for something he's about to sell to an unspecified buyer,"
tt0317919,"00:34:02,417","00:34:06,004","for $850 million, by the way. Or maybe it's not a code word."
tt0317919,"00:34:06,129","00:34:08,799","Maybe it's just a really, really expensive bunny appendage."
tt0317919,"00:34:08,924","00:34:10,425",You have no idea what it is?
tt0317919,"00:34:10,551","00:34:13,262","It's interesting. I used to have this professor at Oxford, okay?"
tt0317919,"00:34:13,387","00:34:16,473","Dr Wickham, his name was, and he was like this massive, fat guy."
tt0317919,"00:34:16,598","00:34:18,934","You know, huge, big guy. We used to call him..."
tt0317919,"00:34:19,059","00:34:20,811","You know... Well, I won't tell you what we used to call him."
tt0317919,"00:34:20,936","00:34:23,647","He taught biomolecular kinetics and cellular dynamics,"
tt0317919,"00:34:23,772","00:34:25,774",and he used to sort of scare the underclassmen
tt0317919,"00:34:25,899","00:34:29,027",with this story about how the world would eventually be eviscerated
tt0317919,"00:34:29,153","00:34:30,487",by technology.
tt0317919,"00:34:30,612","00:34:34,074","You see, it was inevitable that a compound would be created,"
tt0317919,"00:34:34,199","00:34:36,702","which he referred to as the ""Anti-God."""
tt0317919,"00:34:36,827","00:34:39,037","It was like an accelerated mutator, a sort of, you know,"
tt0317919,"00:34:39,163","00:34:42,249",like an unstoppable force of destructive power
tt0317919,"00:34:42,374","00:34:44,084",that would just lay waste to everything.
tt0317919,"00:34:44,209","00:34:46,378",To buildings and parks and streets and children
tt0317919,"00:34:46,503","00:34:49,006","and ice cream parlours, you know?"

tt0317919,"00:34:56,388","00:34:59,224",I always assume it's the Anti-God.
tt0317919,"00:35:00,934","00:35:03,604","End-of-the-world kind of stuff, you know?"
tt0317919,"00:35:05,314","00:35:08,483","But, no, I don't have any idea what it is. I was just speculating."
tt0317919,"00:35:08,609","00:35:10,944","- Did you brief Musgrave on this? - Who, me? No, not yet."
tt0317919,"00:35:11,069","00:35:12,738",- Good. Don't. - What?
tt0317919,"00:35:12,863","00:35:14,573",- Don't tell anyone about this. - This took me ages.

tt0317919,"00:35:16,200","00:35:18,619",I want Musgrave to have deniability.

tt0317919,"00:35:22,664","00:35:24,583",That look in your eye is a pain in my ass.
tt0317919,"00:35:24,708","00:35:26,585","You know that, right?"

tt0317919,"00:36:17,052","00:36:19,638",But nothing in my mind makes sense.

tt0317919,"01:10:14,965","01:10:16,675",She just went downstairs. I'll transfer you.

tt0317919,"01:10:39,740","01:10:40,782",Excuse me.
tt0317919,"01:10:40,908","01:10:43,243",I was wondering if you knew where I might find this patient.
tt0317919,"01:10:43,368","01:10:45,954",Probably not. But I'll know who can.
tt0317919,"01:10:51,251","01:10:52,711",What's that?
tt0317919,"01:11:08,018","01:11:09,937",Sally. Where's Julia?
tt0317919,"01:11:10,479","01:11:12,856",- Where's Julia? - I think she left.
tt0317919,"01:11:12,981","01:11:15,192",Have you tried the east building?
tt0317919,"01:11:21,740","01:11:23,659",- Has Julia left yet? - I haven't seen her.
tt0317919,"01:11:23,784","01:11:25,994","- Mike, Mike. Have you seen Julia? - Hey, you okay?"
tt0317919,"01:11:26,119","01:11:27,663",- Have you seen Julia? - No.

tt0317919,"01:12:32,853","01:12:35,522","Sorry about that, Mr Hunt. We were told to bring you in."
tt0317919,"01:12:35,647","01:12:37,774",- Okay. <i>- Get ready to transport.</i>
tt0317919,"01:12:37,900","01:12:39,651",Whoa. Hey. Just not right now.
tt0317919,"01:12:39,776","01:12:42,154",- Just tell them you came and that... - Ethan. Get in.
tt0317919,"01:12:42,279","01:12:45,616","We don't want to use force here, and you know we will. Ethan, get in."
tt0317919,"01:12:45,741","01:12:47,993",- Tell them that you came here... - Ethan!
tt0317919,"01:12:48,118","01:12:50,204","...and that I left already, okay?"

tt0317919,"01:13:13,811","01:13:15,604",Yeah. Get his hands.
tt0317919,"01:13:43,465","01:13:46,426",I reviewed the transcript of your Berlin operation.
tt0317919,"01:13:46,552","01:13:48,428",It's very interesting.
tt0317919,"01:13:48,554","01:13:50,597",It seems that Agent Farris had some information
tt0317919,"01:13:50,722","01:13:53,934",she wished to share with you but not with this agency.
tt0317919,"01:13:54,059","01:13:55,811",Something you failed to report.
tt0317919,"01:13:55,936","01:13:59,106",You ordered the Vatican operation without proper approvals.
tt0317919,"01:13:59,231","01:14:01,650",That mission resulted in a catastrophic attack.
tt0317919,"01:14:01,775","01:14:03,652",And then you fled the scene.
tt0317919,"01:14:03,777","01:14:06,864","Now, I am not a stranger to disrespect."
tt0317919,"01:14:07,698","01:14:10,534",You don't get to where I am without developing a thick skin.
tt0317919,"01:14:10,659","01:14:12,828","But what I won't stand for,"
tt0317919,"01:14:13,203","01:14:16,456","what I will lose sleep over, and I love my sleep,"
tt0317919,"01:14:16,790","01:14:20,502",is the idea of an irresponsible rogue agent working in my office.
tt0317919,"01:14:20,627","01:14:24,381",So I'm going to slow things way down here.
tt0317919,"01:14:28,010","01:14:29,470",You can look at me
tt0317919,"01:14:29,595","01:14:32,764","with those judgemental, incriminating eyes all you want,"
tt0317919,"01:14:32,890","01:14:34,558",but I bullshit you not.
tt0317919,"01:14:34,683","01:14:38,479",I will bleed on the flag to make sure the stripes stay red.
tt0317919,"01:14:57,539","01:14:59,833",I don't know what to say to you.
tt0317919,"01:15:01,043","01:15:03,795",Brassel's right. You're out of control.
tt0317919,"01:15:05,130","01:15:06,548",Look at me.
tt0317919,"01:15:08,342","01:15:12,638","Ethan, at least show me the courtesy of looking at me when I'm talking to you."
tt0317919,"01:15:21,271","01:15:25,484",I intercepted Davian's call. I know he wants the Rabbit's Foot for Julia's life.
tt0317919,"01:15:25,609","01:15:27,069",It's just...
tt0317919,"01:15:29,488","01:15:30,697",This is
tt0317919,"01:15:31,532","01:15:33,242",<i>so disappointing.</i>

tt0317919,"01:15:51,385","01:15:53,220",Take him to the holding cell.

tt0317919,"01:17:08,629","01:17:10,714","Yes, sir. There's no need to panic. I'll get him back."
tt0317919,"01:17:10,839","01:17:11,882",Sir? Ethan Hunt...
tt0317919,"01:17:12,007","01:17:13,342",I know what happened. Give me the radio.
tt0317919,"01:17:13,467","01:17:16,261",This is Director Brassel. Ethan Hunt is attempting to escape the building.
tt0317919,"01:17:16,386","01:17:18,347",He's in the west cargo elevator. He must be stopped.
tt0317919,"01:17:18,472","01:17:21,225",I want Mendoza and Graham in the situation room right away.
tt0317919,"01:17:21,350","01:17:23,060","I'm having the building surrounded, sir."
tt0317919,"01:17:23,185","01:17:24,853",I've got units posted at all the entrances.
tt0317919,"01:17:24,978","01:17:28,232",<i>This is Brassel again. I'm ordering a code-six lockdown. I repeat.</i>
tt0317919,"01:17:28,357","01:17:30,651",- It's Hunt. - I know it's Hunt.
tt0317919,"01:17:32,444","01:17:35,155",Hunt was flagged on sub-basement nine.
tt0317919,"01:17:35,280","01:17:38,575",I want all security personnel down there now.
tt0317919,"01:17:39,117","01:17:40,744",Security channel's jammed.
tt0317919,"01:17:40,869","01:17:43,956",Hunt must be holding down the transmit button.
tt0317919,"01:18:07,521","01:18:08,856",You've got to be kidding me.

tt0317919,"01:20:42,301","01:20:44,303","According to the plans from Davian's briefcase,"
tt0317919,"01:20:44,428","01:20:47,890",it's in a laboratory on the 56th floor of the Hengshan Lu Building.
tt0317919,"01:20:48,015","01:20:49,850",Which is a nightmare for just about every reason.
tt0317919,"01:20:49,975","01:20:53,437","They're a Chinese military contractor. We have no pull, no details."
tt0317919,"01:20:53,729","01:20:55,522","The good news is, whatever it is,"
tt0317919,"01:20:55,647","01:20:57,900","the Rabbit Foot's small, so we can steal it."
tt0317919,"01:20:58,025","01:21:00,694","The bad news, we got to steal it."
tt0317919,"01:21:01,570","01:21:04,239","From a thief's point of view, this is worst-case scenario."
tt0317919,"01:21:04,364","01:21:06,533",The security guards are all privately-contracted
tt0317919,"01:21:06,658","01:21:07,993",former People's Liberation Army.
tt0317919,"01:21:08,118","01:21:10,370",The only access to the lab is by private elevator.
tt0317919,"01:21:10,496","01:21:13,123",And that can only be activated by persons inside the lab.
tt0317919,"01:21:13,248","01:21:16,084",All of it surveilled by security cameras within the building.
tt0317919,"01:21:16,210","01:21:18,045",What about the roof?
tt0317919,"01:21:19,004","01:21:21,757",Four guards full time. Two on each rooftop.
tt0317919,"01:21:21,882","01:21:23,634",Langley was a cakewalk compared to this.
tt0317919,"01:21:23,759","01:21:25,302",That's the one.
tt0317919,"01:21:26,220","01:21:28,138",- How tall is that building? - Why?
tt0317919,"01:21:28,263","01:21:30,557",It's 162 metres at the highest point.
tt0317919,"01:21:30,682","01:21:33,101","What about that, the building on the left? How tall is that one?"
tt0317919,"01:21:33,227","01:21:34,686",Says 226 metres.
tt0317919,"01:21:34,812","01:21:37,439",226. Distance between the buildings?
tt0317919,"01:21:37,564","01:21:39,358",47.55 metres across.
tt0317919,"01:21:55,999","01:21:57,167",Ethan?
tt0317919,"01:21:57,918","01:22:00,671",That's good. I think it's tall enough.
tt0317919,"01:22:01,880","01:22:04,299",- For what? - A fulcrum.
tt0317919,"01:22:06,426","01:22:09,096","Oh, you're gonna swing... No, no, no, no. Wait, wait."
tt0317919,"01:22:09,221","01:22:11,598","- You could bounce right off the roof. - Yes, I could."
tt0317919,"01:22:11,723","01:22:13,851","Even if you made it to the rooftop, took out the guards,"
tt0317919,"01:22:13,976","01:22:17,563","and got the Rabbit's Foot, you can't just walk out of the lobby. What's your exit?"
tt0317919,"01:22:17,688","01:22:19,314",Base-jump off the top. I need a chute.
tt0317919,"01:22:19,439","01:22:21,608","Even at 162, you're pushing minimum height for a jump."
tt0317919,"01:22:21,733","01:22:23,277",Chute opens any lower than that and you're dead.
tt0317919,"01:22:23,402","01:22:24,444",What are you going to do?
tt0317919,"01:22:24,570","01:22:26,655",Land in the middle of Shanghai and hope no one notices?
tt0317919,"01:22:26,780","01:22:28,031",Central Park's two blocks away.
tt0317919,"01:22:28,157","01:22:30,033","Wait, wait, Ethan, I'm not saying I have a better idea,"
tt0317919,"01:22:30,159","01:22:32,578",but there's a point where bold becomes stupid.
tt0317919,"01:22:32,703","01:22:35,164","Now, we don't even know what this thing is, and you're talking"
tt0317919,"01:22:35,289","01:22:38,125",about handing it over to a guy who provides terrorists with information.
tt0317919,"01:22:38,250","01:22:40,335","Luther, of course I'm not suggesting that we just hand it over."
tt0317919,"01:22:40,460","01:22:43,297",We're going to tag the Rabbit's Foot so we can trace it and know where it is.
tt0317919,"01:22:43,422","01:22:46,300","Now, you know we can get that gear here. I just deliver it myself."
tt0317919,"01:22:46,425","01:22:49,261","We contact Musgrave, have the IMF trace a tag, order a raid,"
tt0317919,"01:22:49,386","01:22:51,138","get the Rabbit's Foot back, grab Davian."
tt0317919,"01:22:51,263","01:22:53,974","Now, if I get out with Julia, we win."
tt0317919,"01:22:55,100","01:22:56,852","If I don't, then..."
tt0317919,"01:23:03,275","01:23:06,153","Look, then she's dead anyway. And so am I."
tt0317919,"01:23:07,362","01:23:08,655",You know?
tt0317919,"01:23:08,780","01:23:13,118","Goddamn it, it's 8:11, it's 8:12."
tt0317919,"01:23:15,621","01:23:18,749",And we have two hours before they kill my wife.
tt0317919,"01:23:19,666","01:23:21,376",Are you in or not?
tt0317919,"01:23:28,967","01:23:30,677",Of course we're in.
tt0317919,"01:24:03,001","01:24:04,753",You got 18 minutes.
tt0317919,"01:24:07,172","01:24:09,049",You're going to make it over there.
tt0317919,"01:24:09,174","01:24:12,511","You're going to find the Rabbit's Foot, get back to the roof,"
tt0317919,"01:24:12,636","01:24:14,429","radio me when you're ready to make the jump,"
tt0317919,"01:24:14,555","01:24:16,974",and we're going to come get you.
tt0317919,"01:24:17,975","01:24:19,726",Thank you for coming.
tt0317919,"01:24:20,477","01:24:21,937",That's my job.
tt0317919,"01:24:58,265","01:24:59,600",Batter up.
tt0317919,"01:25:27,377","01:25:30,422","Oh, yeah. They're freaking out. Hit them again."
tt0317919,"01:27:05,309","01:27:06,435",Okay.
tt0317919,"01:27:07,978","01:27:08,979",<i>He made it.</i>
tt0317919,"01:27:09,188","01:27:10,564",He made it.
tt0317919,"01:27:13,692","01:27:15,444",I knew he'd make it.
tt0317919,"01:27:30,000","01:27:32,920",I'm going in. I'll be out in five minutes.
tt0317919,"01:27:41,094","01:27:43,472",- It's been 12 minutes. - He's got five minutes left.
tt0317919,"01:27:43,597","01:27:47,017","If he doesn't call Davian in five minutes, Julia's dead."
tt0317919,"01:27:47,142","01:27:48,477",<i>Anything?</i>
tt0317919,"01:27:50,062","01:27:51,063",Negative.
tt0317919,"01:27:51,188","01:27:53,315",<i>How about you? Any good news?</i>
tt0317919,"01:27:53,440","01:27:54,858","No, nothing."
tt0317919,"01:27:55,025","01:27:56,527","Come on, Ethan."
tt0317919,"01:28:05,828","01:28:07,287",What is that?
tt0317919,"01:28:12,459","01:28:16,755","When I was little I had a cat, and he used to run away all the time."
tt0317919,"01:28:18,257","01:28:21,385",And it's just a prayer I'd say to bring him home.
tt0317919,"01:28:23,345","01:28:24,847",Teach it to me.
tt0317919,"01:28:26,640","01:28:28,809","<i>I've got the Rabbit's Foot, but I can't make it to the roof.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:28:28,934","01:28:31,728",What the hell do you mean you can't make it to the roof? Where are you?
tt0317919,"01:28:31,854","01:28:33,897","<i>Look up! Look up, look up!</i>"
tt0317919,"01:28:36,775","01:28:38,944","- Oh, shit. - He's way too low."
tt0317919,"01:30:29,721","01:30:32,724",- Ethan! Get in! They're coming! - Who?
tt0317919,"01:30:32,850","01:30:35,477","Building security, and they're pissed."
tt0317919,"01:30:38,105","01:30:39,940","Okay. Go, go, go, go."
tt0317919,"01:30:46,822","01:30:48,907",How much time you got left?
tt0317919,"01:30:49,199","01:30:50,993",Less than two minutes.
tt0317919,"01:30:57,332","01:31:00,460",You gotta get us out of here. I lost the signal.
tt0317919,"01:31:03,172","01:31:04,923",- You okay? - Not yet.
tt0317919,"01:31:13,307","01:31:14,433",Come on. Come on.
tt0317919,"01:31:21,857","01:31:23,442",I don't have a signal. I don't have a signal.
tt0317919,"01:31:23,567","01:31:24,776",I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it!
tt0317919,"01:31:33,243","01:31:34,328",Zhen!
tt0317919,"01:31:36,455","01:31:38,081",Damn it. I'm sorry.
tt0317919,"01:31:46,340","01:31:48,008",Put pressure on it.
tt0317919,"01:31:48,509","01:31:51,637",- Tell me when you get a signal. - What are you doing?
tt0317919,"01:32:10,739","01:32:12,282",I got a signal!
tt0317919,"01:32:16,620","01:32:17,913",Hit redial.
tt0317919,"01:32:20,082","01:32:22,751",<i>You only had five seconds left. Do you realise that?</i>
tt0317919,"01:32:22,876","01:32:25,170",The Rabbit's Foot. I have it.
tt0317919,"01:32:25,546","01:32:29,550",<i>The train yard at Dunan Zhong Lu. Wait for me there. Alone.</i>
tt0317919,"01:32:32,845","01:32:34,304",- Yeah? <i>- Go secure.</i>
tt0317919,"01:32:34,429","01:32:35,639",We are.
tt0317919,"01:32:36,765","01:32:38,767",<i>I have the Rabbit's Foot.</i>
tt0317919,"01:32:38,892","01:32:41,103",- You okay? - I'm tagging it now.
tt0317919,"01:32:44,106","01:32:46,441",You need to run a trace. Make sure we have eyes on this thing.
tt0317919,"01:32:46,567","01:32:49,528",- What's the tag? - 6-3-9-6-4-1.
tt0317919,"01:32:50,487","01:32:51,655",Got it.
tt0317919,"01:32:54,408","01:32:55,701",I see you on Luang Tao Lu Road.
tt0317919,"01:32:55,826","01:32:59,329","If you don't hear from me in eight hours, you send an army after this thing."
tt0317919,"01:32:59,454","01:33:01,290","- Good luck. - You, too."
tt0317919,"01:33:08,714","01:33:10,507",<i>- Mr Musgrave. - Yeah.</i>
tt0317919,"01:33:10,757","01:33:12,801",<i>It's come to my attention that yesterday afternoon</i>
tt0317919,"01:33:12,926","01:33:14,428",<i>you sent a team to the Far East.</i>
tt0317919,"01:33:15,053","01:33:17,097",We received intel that Hadaam Saleen Bahar
tt0317919,"01:33:17,222","01:33:18,474",was en route to Shanghai.
tt0317919,"01:33:18,599","01:33:20,893",- Hadaam Saleen Bahar. - That's right.
tt0317919,"01:33:21,018","01:33:22,936",You know what I'd love? I'd love to see that intel.
tt0317919,"01:33:23,061","01:33:25,481","- I'll be in my office. - Yes, sir."
tt0317919,"01:33:38,035","01:33:39,536",Thanks again.
tt0317919,"01:33:39,953","01:33:41,914",I'll see you back home.
tt0317919,"01:33:42,831","01:33:44,041",Ethan.
tt0317919,"01:33:45,250","01:33:48,212",You know they probably plan to kill you both.
tt0317919,"01:33:49,922","01:33:52,216",Then I won't see you back home.
tt0317919,"01:33:53,801","01:33:55,344",Better get back.
tt0317919,"01:34:42,349","01:34:44,726",Drink it. No questions.
tt0317919,"01:35:48,332","01:35:49,708",Good morning.
tt0317919,"01:36:05,641","01:36:06,767",Jules.
tt0317919,"01:36:07,976","01:36:10,813",We've put an explosive charge in your head.
tt0317919,"01:36:10,938","01:36:12,981",Does that sound familiar?
tt0317919,"01:36:13,732","01:36:16,026",The Rabbit's Foot. Where is it?
tt0317919,"01:36:16,777","01:36:18,445",I gave it to you.
tt0317919,"01:36:19,029","01:36:21,240","Now, I'm going to count to 10"
tt0317919,"01:36:21,365","01:36:24,993",and you're going to tell me where the Rabbit's Foot is
tt0317919,"01:36:26,411","01:36:27,788",or she dies.
tt0317919,"01:36:52,980","01:36:56,316",Seems we have a lot to talk about. Don't we?
tt0317919,"01:36:59,153","01:37:01,071",- Do you think I'm playing? - Son of a bitch!
tt0317919,"01:37:01,196","01:37:03,907",Do you think I'm playing? You don't think I'll do it?
tt0317919,"01:37:04,032","01:37:05,075",Where is it?
tt0317919,"01:37:05,200","01:37:06,535",- Look at me. - Where the hell is it?
tt0317919,"01:37:06,660","01:37:07,911",- Look at me. Stay with me. - Seven!
tt0317919,"01:37:08,036","01:37:10,247",I am going to kill you. I swear to God I'm going to...
tt0317919,"01:37:10,372","01:37:12,207","- Eight! - No, please."
tt0317919,"01:37:14,042","01:37:17,546",Please. Don't do this. Just let her go.
tt0317919,"01:37:18,172","01:37:21,175",I promise you. I promise you.
tt0317919,"01:37:21,550","01:37:24,219",- I can figure out how to get whatever... - Nine.
tt0317919,"01:37:25,262","01:37:28,182",Listen to me. I want to help you get whatever you want.
tt0317919,"01:37:28,307","01:37:31,852",But you got to do what's right. What you know is right.
tt0317919,"01:37:32,769","01:37:34,229","No, please..."
tt0317919,"01:37:36,899","01:37:37,941",No.
tt0317919,"01:37:40,194","01:37:41,195",No.
tt0317919,"01:37:41,570","01:37:43,280",- Ten. - Don't!
tt0317919,"01:38:00,130","01:38:03,759",I pushed him as far as he can go. I know he's not lying.
tt0317919,"01:38:04,092","01:38:05,594",I understand.
tt0317919,"01:38:06,220","01:38:09,389",I've got some questions I want to ask him first.
tt0317919,"01:38:31,829","01:38:33,455",It's complicated.
tt0317919,"01:38:40,379","01:38:42,589",You can't just open the canister.
tt0317919,"01:38:42,714","01:38:45,551",We had to make sure you brought the real thing.
tt0317919,"01:38:45,676","01:38:48,971",The Rabbit's Foot. Now we know.
tt0317919,"01:38:57,771","01:39:00,983",Don't you touch her! Don't you touch her!
tt0317919,"01:39:10,242","01:39:13,662","Davian's translator, his Head of Security."
tt0317919,"01:39:14,997","01:39:18,125",Remember? At the Vatican she failed him.
tt0317919,"01:39:20,502","01:39:24,673","Ethan, Julia is still alive."
tt0317919,"01:39:25,507","01:39:29,344","Davian wanted to kill you both, but I convinced him otherwise."
tt0317919,"01:39:29,470","01:39:33,307",Julia hasn't seen me. She doesn't know anything. She's clean.
tt0317919,"01:39:33,474","01:39:35,767",She can go on to have a life.
tt0317919,"01:39:36,185","01:39:40,731","As long as you tell me, what was in Lindsey's message?"
tt0317919,"01:39:41,732","01:39:44,568",I know she sent you a microdot from Berlin.
tt0317919,"01:39:45,986","01:39:48,447",Did Lindsey know about me and Davian?
tt0317919,"01:39:48,572","01:39:51,492",Is that why she sent the message to you? Did you read it?
tt0317919,"01:39:51,617","01:39:53,243",Did anyone else see it?
tt0317919,"01:39:53,368","01:39:55,621",Did she know about the work I was doing?
tt0317919,"01:39:55,746","01:39:57,706",Could I be compromised at IMF?
tt0317919,"01:39:57,831","01:39:59,458",Ethan. Ethan.
tt0317919,"01:40:00,918","01:40:03,253",Did she buy that Brassel set her up?
tt0317919,"01:40:03,378","01:40:05,088",Did she buy that?
tt0317919,"01:40:06,381","01:40:07,800",You told him.
tt0317919,"01:40:09,176","01:40:11,637",That's how Davian knew Lindsey was coming.
tt0317919,"01:40:11,762","01:40:13,347",You told him.
tt0317919,"01:40:15,307","01:40:17,559",I thought you could get her back.
tt0317919,"01:40:17,684","01:40:21,271","But I wasn't gonna let Brassel, of all people, undo the work I'd done."
tt0317919,"01:40:21,396","01:40:25,818","I took action, Ethan, on behalf of the working families of our country."
tt0317919,"01:40:25,943","01:40:27,319","The Armed Forces, the White House."
tt0317919,"01:40:27,444","01:40:29,363",I'd had enough of Brassel and his sanctimony.
tt0317919,"01:40:29,488","01:40:32,783",IMF Executive Director. He's an affirmative action poster boy.
tt0317919,"01:40:32,908","01:40:36,370","You grab Davian like he wanted, then what?"
tt0317919,"01:40:36,954","01:40:38,580",Davian's a weed.
tt0317919,"01:40:40,290","01:40:44,336","You cut him out, two more spring up just like him the next day."
tt0317919,"01:40:44,545","01:40:46,421",Arrest him? Then what?
tt0317919,"01:40:47,881","01:40:49,258",You use him.
tt0317919,"01:40:50,759","01:40:53,387",Collaborate with him.
tt0317919,"01:40:54,888","01:40:56,890",And it's Christmas.
tt0317919,"01:40:58,725","01:41:01,645","In 18 hours, the Rabbit's Foot will be delivered"
tt0317919,"01:41:01,770","01:41:05,023","to its Middle Eastern buyer, and we'll have credible intel to prove it."
tt0317919,"01:41:05,149","01:41:07,985",US Security Council will get a report by this time tomorrow.
tt0317919,"01:41:08,110","01:41:11,155",We're talking a military strike within a week.
tt0317919,"01:41:11,572","01:41:13,615","And when the sand settles,"
tt0317919,"01:41:14,116","01:41:16,577",our country will do what it does best.
tt0317919,"01:41:16,702","01:41:19,371",Clean up. Infrastructure.
tt0317919,"01:41:21,123","01:41:22,708",Democracy wins.
tt0317919,"01:41:27,087","01:41:29,923",What was Lindsey's message?
tt0317919,"01:41:30,966","01:41:34,261","You tell me, and Julia walks."
tt0317919,"01:41:36,847","01:41:39,308",It's the only play you have left.
tt0317919,"01:41:40,684","01:41:44,062","Not till I hear her voice, know she's alive."
tt0317919,"01:41:46,231","01:41:47,524",Of course.
tt0317919,"01:42:00,662","01:42:01,997",Put her on.
tt0317919,"01:42:09,630","01:42:11,297",- Jules? <i>- Ethan?</i>
tt0317919,"01:42:11,298","01:42:11,757",- Jules? <i>- Ethan?</i>
tt0317919,"01:42:12,049","01:42:15,302","When we met, there was a lake near the mountain."
tt0317919,"01:42:17,513","01:42:19,473",What was the lake called?
tt0317919,"01:42:20,808","01:42:22,017",<i>Wanaka.</i>
tt0317919,"01:42:22,643","01:42:24,186","<i>Please, Ethan.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:42:24,394","01:42:26,939","- Jules. <i>- Ethan, I don't understand...</i>"
tt0317919,"01:42:46,333","01:42:47,835",Benjamin Dunne.
tt0317919,"01:42:48,585","01:42:49,628","Benji, it's me."
tt0317919,"01:42:49,753","01:42:52,798",<i>- Ethan.</i> - What? No. Really?
tt0317919,"01:42:52,923","01:42:54,591",<i>Listen to me very carefully. I need your help.</i>
tt0317919,"01:42:56,301","01:42:59,513",I need to trace the location of the last call made from this phone.
tt0317919,"01:42:59,638","01:43:01,265","Look, no. Ethan. Shush."
tt0317919,"01:43:01,390","01:43:03,100",<i>They're looking... Everyone's looking for you.</i>
tt0317919,"01:43:03,225","01:43:06,270",<i>Everyone I know. They're looking... I just looked it up.</i>
tt0317919,"01:43:06,395","01:43:08,188","<i>Okay, you're on Interpol's most wanted list.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:43:08,313","01:43:10,774","And that, by the way, is a spectacular list to be on."
tt0317919,"01:43:10,899","01:43:13,318","<i>Whatever happened, I'm sorry, but I'm hanging up now right now.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:43:13,443","01:43:14,653","Benji, I don't have time for this."
tt0317919,"01:43:14,778","01:43:16,405",What do you think happened? I've been set up.
tt0317919,"01:43:16,530","01:43:19,575",I think I like my job. Okay? A lot.
tt0317919,"01:43:19,700","01:43:21,535",All right? And you know they're gonna be taping this call.
tt0317919,"01:43:21,869","01:43:24,580",And you know you can erase it. I'm giving you the number right now.
tt0317919,"01:43:24,705","01:43:26,790",- Are you ready? - All right. Just hang on.
tt0317919,"01:43:26,915","01:43:29,251","I'm gonna lose my citizenship because of this, you know."
tt0317919,"01:43:29,376","01:43:32,212",7-3-4-4-2-5-6-4-3-6-7.
tt0317919,"01:43:32,337","01:43:35,090","Okay. Wait. Okay. Hold the line, please."
tt0317919,"01:43:49,438","01:43:51,023",- Are you there? - Yeah.
tt0317919,"01:43:51,148","01:43:52,357",<i>Okay.</i>
tt0317919,"01:43:53,066","01:43:56,195","<i>Maybe we can share a jail cell together, you know?</i>"
tt0317919,"01:43:56,320","01:43:58,864","If this all goes tits up, which it will."
tt0317919,"01:43:58,989","01:44:00,782",The location of that number is Shanghai.
tt0317919,"01:44:00,908","01:44:02,159","There, I just told you. Shanghai."
tt0317919,"01:44:02,284","01:44:04,870",I've just aided and abetted an enemy of the state. Fantastic. Thank you.
tt0317919,"01:44:04,995","01:44:07,289",Am I close? Use this phone to track my location.
tt0317919,"01:44:07,414","01:44:09,792","Oh, you're there. Well, you're close."
tt0317919,"01:44:09,917","01:44:11,668",How close? Is the signal in the building?
tt0317919,"01:44:11,794","01:44:13,212","No, no, no. It isn't coming from there."
tt0317919,"01:44:13,337","01:44:15,130",It's in a building one mile to the northeast.
tt0317919,"01:44:15,255","01:44:16,840","<i>Benji, lead me to the signal.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:44:29,394","01:44:32,898",<i>There is one thing. What the hell are you doing in Shanghai?</i>
tt0317919,"01:44:33,023","01:44:35,192",I'll tell you when I see you.
tt0317919,"01:44:43,742","01:44:45,994",What you... You need to go north.
tt0317919,"01:44:46,119","01:44:48,455","Okay, there's a bridge. Get to it, cross it."
tt0317919,"01:44:48,580","01:44:51,917",<i>Make a left. Go three-quarters of a mile along the river.</i>
tt0317919,"01:44:52,042","01:44:53,836",I got it. I got it.
tt0317919,"01:45:29,246","01:45:31,165","Good, good. That's right. Keep going. Keep going."
tt0317919,"01:45:31,290","01:45:32,666",Make your next left and then the next one.
tt0317919,"01:45:32,791","01:45:34,376","And then follow that down 1,000 yards."
tt0317919,"01:45:34,501","01:45:36,170",A thousand yards.
tt0317919,"01:45:36,545","01:45:39,423","- Okay. Okay, okay. <i>- Okay, okay. Left. Left.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:45:40,007","01:45:42,092","Yeah, that's good. That's good. Keep going. Keep going."
tt0317919,"01:45:42,217","01:45:44,344","Okay, now look... Hiya. Hi."
tt0317919,"01:45:44,470","01:45:45,929","<i>Benji, where?</i>"
tt0317919,"01:45:46,054","01:45:48,307",<i>- Benji? Which way do I go?</i> - Now take a right.
tt0317919,"01:45:55,063","01:45:56,523","Okay. Go down, left."
tt0317919,"01:45:56,940","01:45:58,775",Left? I'm going left.
tt0317919,"01:46:00,694","01:46:01,778","<i>Good, good.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:46:01,904","01:46:03,614",It's in the second building on your left.
tt0317919,"01:46:03,739","01:46:06,074",The signal bearing's plus or minus three metres
tt0317919,"01:46:06,200","01:46:07,326",from the northeast corner.
tt0317919,"01:46:07,868","01:46:09,119",I owe you.
tt0317919,"01:48:06,403","01:48:08,322",Jules. Jules.
tt0317919,"01:48:08,989","01:48:10,616",You're gonna be okay.
tt0317919,"01:48:13,660","01:48:14,912","Oh, God!"
tt0317919,"01:48:15,454","01:48:16,497",God!
tt0317919,"01:48:27,174","01:48:29,593",I've activated the charge in your head.
tt0317919,"01:48:35,098","01:48:37,559",You have maybe four minutes left.
tt0317919,"01:48:47,069","01:48:49,738",Didn't I tell you she'd call out your name?
tt0317919,"01:48:55,869","01:48:58,831",Ethan. Ethan.
tt0317919,"01:49:02,960","01:49:04,044",No.
tt0317919,"01:49:08,924","01:49:10,217",Please.
tt0317919,"01:49:15,055","01:49:18,392",And I told you I was going to kill you in front of her?
tt0317919,"01:49:18,517","01:49:20,936","Well, I'm going to kill her in front of you."
tt0317919,"01:51:13,590","01:51:14,716",Ethan?
tt0317919,"01:51:18,053","01:51:19,513",Are you okay?
tt0317919,"01:51:20,597","01:51:22,307","I don't understand what's going on, Ethan."
tt0317919,"01:51:22,432","01:51:25,352",- I know. I know. Just wait. - What do those men want from you?
tt0317919,"01:51:25,477","01:51:28,105",Why are we here? How did you find me?
tt0317919,"01:51:29,231","01:51:32,025","Please, Ethan. What the hell is going on?"
tt0317919,"01:51:32,192","01:51:33,485",Are you okay?
tt0317919,"01:51:33,610","01:51:37,322","Ethan, what's wrong? Okay. Oh, God."
tt0317919,"01:51:40,450","01:51:44,329",I'm going to tell you everything. You just stay with me.
tt0317919,"01:51:50,961","01:51:53,881",Ethan. What's happening? What are you looking for?
tt0317919,"01:51:54,006","01:51:56,717",- We've got to get out of here. - Not yet.
tt0317919,"01:51:58,510","01:52:00,179",- They don't have one! - What?
tt0317919,"01:52:00,304","01:52:02,723",- A defibrillator. - A defibrillator?
tt0317919,"01:52:02,848","01:52:03,932",Ethan?
tt0317919,"01:52:04,725","01:52:08,645",Ethan? Who are these people? What the hell are we doing here?
tt0317919,"01:52:11,565","01:52:12,774",Good!
tt0317919,"01:52:14,234","01:52:16,320",This is a Beretta 92F.
tt0317919,"01:52:17,154","01:52:18,947","It's a very accurate, close-range weapon."
tt0317919,"01:52:19,072","01:52:21,283",- Don't point it at me. - Sorry.
tt0317919,"01:52:23,285","01:52:24,661",It holds 15 rounds.
tt0317919,"01:52:24,787","01:52:28,123","When the mag is empty, the slide will lock back like this."
tt0317919,"01:52:28,248","01:52:30,459",How do you know so much about this?
tt0317919,"01:52:30,584","01:52:33,170","To reload, push this button."
tt0317919,"01:52:33,629","01:52:35,172",The empty mag falls out
tt0317919,"01:52:35,297","01:52:37,216","and you shove the other one in,"
tt0317919,"01:52:37,341","01:52:39,802","like the batteries in the flashlight in the kitchen,"
tt0317919,"01:52:39,927","01:52:41,845",then release the slide.
tt0317919,"01:52:45,057","01:52:47,059",- Why are you giving me a gun? - There could be others.
tt0317919,"01:52:47,184","01:52:48,936","If you have to use it, you stay low."
tt0317919,"01:52:49,061","01:52:51,772",You identify your enemy. Point and shoot.
tt0317919,"01:52:51,897","01:52:53,440",It's very simple. Point and shoot.
tt0317919,"01:52:53,565","01:52:54,942",Stand back.
tt0317919,"01:52:56,693","01:52:57,778",Good.
tt0317919,"01:52:59,112","01:53:01,824",I have a charge in my head. I'm going to die unless you kill me.
tt0317919,"01:53:01,949","01:53:03,909",- What? - Throw the switch on and off.
tt0317919,"01:53:04,034","01:53:05,452",- Don't forget the off. - I can't do that.
tt0317919,"01:53:05,577","01:53:07,788",You can bring me back. I'll come back.
tt0317919,"01:53:07,913","01:53:10,124",- I can't. - You have to! There's no time!
tt0317919,"01:53:10,249","01:53:11,708",Now! Please!
tt0317919,"01:53:18,590","01:53:21,135","Wait, wait! Wait. Wait. I love you."
tt0317919,"01:53:21,426","01:53:22,761",I love you.
tt0317919,"01:54:37,920","01:54:39,129","Oh, God."
tt0317919,"01:54:45,302","01:54:46,762","Come on, baby."
tt0317919,"01:54:51,141","01:54:54,561","One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,"
tt0317919,"01:54:54,686","01:54:58,273","nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen."
tt0317919,"01:55:03,403","01:55:07,908","Come on, baby. I need you to come back."
tt0317919,"01:55:09,326","01:55:10,911",I need you back.
tt0317919,"01:55:57,166","01:55:58,459","Oh, God."
tt0317919,"01:56:07,718","01:56:09,136",You did that?
tt0317919,"01:56:13,015","01:56:14,099",Wow.
tt0317919,"01:56:41,001","01:56:43,086","So, I was just thinking..."
tt0317919,"01:56:45,547","01:56:49,468",I was thinking you might want to tell me why we're in China.
tt0317919,"01:56:51,011","01:56:52,221",I know.
tt0317919,"01:56:56,350","01:56:57,392",I...
tt0317919,"01:56:59,228","01:57:01,063",I work for an agency.
tt0317919,"01:57:02,147","01:57:03,732",It's called IMF.
tt0317919,"01:57:06,485","01:57:08,445",What does that stand for?
tt0317919,"01:57:09,696","01:57:11,740",Impossible Mission Force.
tt0317919,"01:57:12,741","01:57:13,909",Shut up.
tt0317919,"01:57:14,827","01:57:16,161","No, I'm not kidding."
tt0317919,"01:57:16,286","01:57:20,165",You don't understand. Everything I'm telling you is top-secret.
