"00:00:47,812","00:00:51,088",<i>- Is everything in place? - You weren 't supposed to relieve me.</i>
"00:00:51,332","00:00:53,846","<i>I know, but I felt like taking a shift.</i>"
"00:00:54,372","00:00:56,647","<i>You like him, don 't you? You like watching him.</i>"
"00:00:56,892","00:00:59,770",<i>- Don 't be ridiculous. - We're gonna kill him. You understand?</i>
"00:01:00,012","00:01:02,401",<i>Morpheus believes he is the One.</i>
"00:01:02,652","00:01:03,482",<i>Do you?</i>
"00:01:03,732","00:01:05,450",<i>It doesn 't matter what I believe.</i>
"00:01:05,692","00:01:07,250","<i>You don 't, do you?</i>"
"00:01:07,492","00:01:09,483",<i>- Did you hear that? - Hear what?</i>
"00:01:09,732","00:01:11,245",<i>Are you sure this line is clean?</i>
"00:01:11,492","00:01:13,403","<i>Yeah, of course I'm sure.</i>"
"00:01:13,732","00:01:15,131",<i>I better go.</i>
"00:01:51,532","00:01:53,250",- Freeze! Police! - Hands on your head!
"00:01:53,772","00:01:54,807",Do it! Do it now!
"00:02:15,332","00:02:16,606",Lieutenant.
"00:02:16,892","00:02:17,847","Oh, shit."
"00:02:18,652","00:02:21,724","Lieutenant, you were given specific orders."
"00:02:21,972","00:02:23,610",I'm just doing my job.
"00:02:24,212","00:02:28,444","You give me that ""juris-my-dick-tion"" crap, you can cram it up your ass."
"00:02:28,892","00:02:31,281",The orders were for your protection.
"00:02:32,732","00:02:34,848",I think we can handle one little girl.
"00:02:39,772","00:02:41,444",I sent two units!
"00:02:41,692","00:02:43,205",They're bringing her down now!
"00:02:43,452","00:02:46,444","No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead."
"00:03:14,645","00:03:15,441",Shit.
"00:03:17,885","00:03:20,160","Morpheus, the line was traced. I don't know how."
"00:03:20,405","00:03:21,918",<i>I know. They cut the hard line.</i>
"00:03:22,165","00:03:24,235",<i>There's no time. Get to another exit.</i>
"00:03:24,485","00:03:25,804",Are there any agents?
"00:03:26,005","00:03:26,801",<i>Yes.</i>
"00:03:27,005","00:03:28,120",Goddamn it.
"00:03:28,365","00:03:29,844","<i>You have to focus, Trinity.</i>"
"00:03:30,085","00:03:32,360",<i>There's a phone at Wells and Lake.</i>
"00:03:32,725","00:03:34,317",<i>You can make it.</i>
"00:03:34,565","00:03:36,157",<i>- All right. - Go.</i>
"00:04:35,765","00:04:36,754",That's impossible.
"00:05:10,325","00:05:12,281","Get up, Trinity. Just get up."
"00:05:12,885","00:05:14,034",Get up.
"00:05:58,045","00:05:59,478",She got out.
"00:05:59,765","00:06:00,993",It doesn't matter.
"00:06:01,245","00:06:03,236",The informant is real.
"00:06:04,525","00:06:06,117",We have the name of their next target.
"00:06:06,365","00:06:07,957",The name is Neo.
"00:06:11,125","00:06:12,558",We'll need a search running.
"00:06:12,845","00:06:14,676",It has already begun.
"00:07:07,205","00:07:08,354",What?
"00:07:13,885","00:07:15,318",What the hell?
"00:07:22,645","00:07:24,522","""Follow the white rabbit."""
"00:07:35,885","00:07:37,000",Who is it?
"00:07:37,245","00:07:38,473",It's Choi.
"00:07:51,445","00:07:52,560",You're two hours late.
"00:07:53,125","00:07:54,797",I know. It's her fault.
"00:07:55,085","00:07:55,995",You got the money?
"00:07:58,045","00:07:59,160",Two grand.
"00:08:00,005","00:08:01,074",Hold on.
"00:08:18,045","00:08:19,364",Hallelujah.
"00:08:19,605","00:08:22,358",You're my savior. My own personal Jesus Christ.
"00:08:22,605","00:08:24,402",You get caught using that...
"00:08:24,645","00:08:26,681",I know. This never happened. You don't exist.
"00:08:27,765","00:08:29,756","- Right. - Something wrong, man?"
"00:08:30,005","00:08:31,961",You look a little whiter than usual.
"00:08:33,045","00:08:35,115","My computer, it..."
"00:08:38,005","00:08:42,362",Ever have that feeling where you're not sure if you're awake or dreaming?
"00:08:43,125","00:08:45,764",All the time. It's called mescaline.
"00:08:46,245","00:08:48,281",It's the only way to fly.
"00:08:49,125","00:08:51,514",It just sounds like you need to unplug.
"00:08:52,245","00:08:54,201",Get some R and R?
"00:08:54,565","00:08:58,160","What do you think, Dujour? Should we take him with us?"
"00:09:00,085","00:09:01,234",Definitely.
"00:09:01,485","00:09:04,522","No, I can't. I have work tomorrow."
"00:09:05,045","00:09:06,114",Come on.
"00:09:06,365","00:09:08,879",It'll be fun. I promise.
"00:09:15,125","00:09:16,558",Yeah.
"00:09:17,365","00:09:19,162",Sure. I'll go.
"00:09:45,725","00:09:46,635","Hello, Neo."
"00:09:48,125","00:09:49,035",How do you know that name?
"00:09:49,845","00:09:51,483",I know a lot about you.
"00:09:52,325","00:09:53,121",Who are you?
"00:09:53,365","00:09:54,320",My name is Trinity.
"00:09:55,245","00:09:56,394",Trinity.
"00:09:58,125","00:09:59,080",The Trinity?
"00:09:59,525","00:10:01,163",That cracked the IRS D-base?
"00:10:01,405","00:10:02,804",That was a long time ago.
"00:10:03,045","00:10:03,841",Jesus.
"00:10:04,085","00:10:04,881",What?
"00:10:05,325","00:10:07,043",I just thought...
"00:10:08,725","00:10:09,840",...you were a guy.
"00:10:10,085","00:10:11,484",Most guys do.
"00:10:12,645","00:10:14,761",That was you on my computer.
"00:10:15,365","00:10:16,434",How did you do that?
"00:10:17,045","00:10:19,639","Right now, all I can tell you..."
"00:10:20,245","00:10:21,724",...is that you're in danger.
"00:10:22,165","00:10:24,474",- I brought you here to warn you. - Of what?
"00:10:25,045","00:10:26,637","They're watching you, Neo."
"00:10:27,205","00:10:28,001",Who is?
"00:10:28,205","00:10:29,524",Please just listen.
"00:10:32,885","00:10:34,637","I know why you're here, Neo."
"00:10:35,405","00:10:37,282",I know what you've been doing.
"00:10:37,525","00:10:39,322",I know why you hardly sleep...
"00:10:39,605","00:10:42,597","...why you live alone and why, night after night..."
"00:10:42,845","00:10:45,075",...you sit at your computer.
"00:10:46,205","00:10:47,684",You're looking for him.
"00:10:48,445","00:10:51,323","I know, because I was once looking for the same thing."
"00:10:51,805","00:10:53,841",And when he found me...
"00:10:54,445","00:10:57,403",...he told me I wasn't really looking for him...
"00:10:58,285","00:10:59,957",...I was looking for an answer.
"00:11:00,565","00:11:03,557","It's the question that drives us, Neo."
"00:11:04,205","00:11:06,765",It's the question that brought you here.
"00:11:08,765","00:11:10,084",You know the question...
"00:11:10,325","00:11:11,758",...just as I did.
"00:11:13,245","00:11:14,803",What is the Matrix?
"00:11:15,045","00:11:17,400","The answer is out there, Neo."
"00:11:18,045","00:11:19,956",It's looking for you.
"00:11:20,725","00:11:22,363",And it will find you...
"00:11:22,605","00:11:24,516",...if you want it to.
"00:11:31,045","00:11:31,841",Shit.
"00:11:32,085","00:11:33,279","Shit, shit."
"00:11:43,125","00:11:45,844","You have a problem with authority, Mr. Anderson."
"00:11:46,085","00:11:49,964","You believe that you are special, that the rules do not apply to you."
"00:11:50,645","00:11:52,556","Obviously, you are mistaken."
"00:11:55,405","00:11:58,158",This is one of the top software companies in the world...
"00:11:58,405","00:12:01,636",...because employees understand they are part of a whole.
"00:12:01,885","00:12:06,322","Thus, if an employee has a problem, the company has a problem."
"00:12:08,485","00:12:11,557","The time has come to make a choice, Mr. Anderson."
"00:12:12,405","00:12:16,114",Either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forth...
"00:12:16,725","00:12:19,193",...or you choose to find another job.
"00:12:20,045","00:12:21,319",Do I make myself clear?
"00:12:21,565","00:12:23,874","Yes, Mr. Rhineheart. Perfectly clear."
"00:12:32,005","00:12:32,801",Thomas Anderson?
"00:12:35,005","00:12:36,358","Yeah, that's me."
"00:12:44,045","00:12:45,160",Great.
"00:12:46,525","00:12:47,640",Have a nice day.
"00:13:03,765","00:13:06,962","<i>Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?</i>"
"00:13:09,125","00:13:10,797",<i>- Morpheus. - Yes.</i>
"00:13:11,045","00:13:12,956",<i>I've been looking for you.</i>
"00:13:13,205","00:13:16,242",<i>I don 't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you.</i>
"00:13:16,485","00:13:19,522","<i>But unfortunately, you and I have run out of time.</i>"
"00:13:19,765","00:13:23,314","<i>They're coming for you, and I don 't know what they're going to do.</i>"
"00:13:23,565","00:13:24,839",Who's coming for me?
"00:13:25,085","00:13:27,076",<i>Stand up and see for yourself.</i>
"00:13:27,325","00:13:28,758",What? Right now?
"00:13:29,045","00:13:30,000",<i>Yes.</i>
"00:13:30,245","00:13:31,439",<i>Now.</i>
"00:13:32,285","00:13:34,082",<i>Do it slowly.</i>
"00:13:34,485","00:13:35,634",<i>The elevator.</i>
"00:13:40,325","00:13:42,043","Oh, shit!"
"00:13:46,525","00:13:47,480",What do they want?
"00:13:47,725","00:13:51,240","<i>I don 't know. If you don 't want to find out, get out of there.</i>"
"00:13:51,485","00:13:52,076",How?
"00:13:52,285","00:13:55,322","<i>I can guide you, but you must do exactly as I say.</i>"
"00:13:56,165","00:13:58,076",<i>The cubicle across from you is empty.</i>
"00:14:01,085","00:14:03,121",<i>- But what if they... - Go. Now.</i>
"00:14:09,605","00:14:11,880",<i>Stay here for just a moment.</i>
"00:14:18,805","00:14:21,444","<i>When I tell you, go to the end of the row...</i>"
"00:14:21,685","00:14:23,562",<i>... to the office at the end of the hall.</i>
"00:14:23,805","00:14:26,080",<i>Stay as low as you can.</i>
"00:14:28,405","00:14:29,360",<i>Go. Now.</i>
"00:14:43,165","00:14:46,555","<i>Good. Now, outside there is a scaffold.</i>"
"00:14:49,165","00:14:51,395",<i>- How do you know this? - We don 't have time.</i>
"00:14:51,645","00:14:54,364",<i>To your left there's a window. Go to it.</i>
"00:14:56,525","00:14:58,004",<i>Open it.</i>
"00:14:58,805","00:15:00,523",<i>Take the scaffold to the roof.</i>
"00:15:00,765","00:15:03,233",No way! No way! This is crazy!
"00:15:03,485","00:15:05,760",<i>There are two ways out of this building.</i>
"00:15:06,005","00:15:09,634",<i>One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.</i>
"00:15:09,885","00:15:12,957",<i>You take a chance either way. I leave it to you.</i>
"00:15:16,405","00:15:18,077",This is insane!
"00:15:19,205","00:15:21,002",Why is this happening to me?
"00:15:21,285","00:15:22,843",What'd I do?
"00:15:23,205","00:15:25,844",I'm nobody. I didn't do anything.
"00:15:26,405","00:15:27,804",I'm gonna die.
"00:15:37,205","00:15:38,194",Shit!
"00:15:57,645","00:15:58,714","Oh, shit!"
"00:16:03,485","00:16:05,203",I can't do this.
"00:16:17,525","00:16:18,321",Shit.
"00:17:05,565","00:17:10,195","As you can see, we've had our eye on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson."
"00:17:11,445","00:17:14,005",It seems that you've been living...
"00:17:14,245","00:17:16,281",...two lives.
"00:17:17,645","00:17:20,034","In one life, you're Thomas A. Anderson..."
"00:17:20,285","00:17:23,482",...program writer for a respectable software company.
"00:17:24,485","00:17:27,636",You have a social security number. You pay your taxes.
"00:17:28,085","00:17:29,279",And you...
"00:17:30,805","00:17:34,275",...help your landlady carry out her garbage.
"00:17:36,685","00:17:39,677",The other life is lived in computers...
"00:17:39,965","00:17:42,798","...where you go by the hacker alias ""Neo""..."
"00:17:43,045","00:17:47,641",...and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for.
"00:17:48,885","00:17:50,762",One of these lives...
"00:17:51,005","00:17:52,757",...has a future.
"00:17:53,085","00:17:54,996",And one of them does not.
"00:17:58,565","00:18:02,240","I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be, Mr. Anderson."
"00:18:03,205","00:18:04,479",You're here...
"00:18:04,805","00:18:06,955",...because we need your help.
"00:18:10,445","00:18:13,323",We know that you've been contacted by a certain...
"00:18:13,565","00:18:15,283",...individual.
"00:18:16,165","00:18:20,044","A man who calls himself ""Morpheus."""
"00:18:21,005","00:18:24,839",Whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant.
"00:18:25,085","00:18:27,394",He is considered by many authorities...
"00:18:27,645","00:18:30,557",...to be the most dangerous man alive.
"00:18:33,205","00:18:34,354",My colleagues...
"00:18:34,765","00:18:37,563",...believe that I am wasting my time with you.
"00:18:37,845","00:18:41,121",But I believe you wish to do the right thing.
"00:18:41,405","00:18:44,761",We're willing to wipe the slate clean...
"00:18:45,125","00:18:47,161",...give you a fresh start.
"00:18:47,645","00:18:50,443",All we're asking in return is your cooperation...
"00:18:50,685","00:18:54,041",...in bringing a known terrorist to justice.
"00:18:55,365","00:18:56,559",Yeah.
"00:18:57,805","00:18:59,796",That sounds like a really good deal.
"00:19:01,365","00:19:03,037",But I got a better one.
"00:19:03,285","00:19:04,718",How about...
"00:19:05,125","00:19:07,036",...I give you the finger...
"00:19:09,525","00:19:11,481",...and you give me my phone call.
"00:19:13,565","00:19:15,317",Mr. Anderson...
"00:19:19,525","00:19:20,321",...you disappoint me.
"00:19:20,565","00:19:23,079",You can't scare me with this gestapo crap.
"00:19:23,325","00:19:24,644",I know my rights.
"00:19:24,885","00:19:26,318",I want my phone call.
"00:19:26,885","00:19:28,955","Tell me, Mr. Anderson..."
"00:19:29,805","00:19:31,158",...what good is a phone call...
"00:19:31,405","00:19:34,841",...if you're unable to speak?
"00:20:07,245","00:20:09,361","You're going to help us, Mr. Anderson..."
"00:20:10,045","00:20:10,955",...whether you want to...
"00:20:11,205","00:20:12,035",...or not.
"00:21:07,965","00:21:11,082","<i>This line is tapped, so I must be brief.</i>"
"00:21:11,325","00:21:15,443","<i>They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.</i>"
"00:21:15,685","00:21:17,437",<i>If they knew what I know...</i>
"00:21:17,685","00:21:19,596",<i>... you would probably be dead.</i>
"00:21:20,565","00:21:24,114",What are you talking about? What is happening to me?
"00:21:24,365","00:21:28,995","<i>You are the One, Neo. You may have spent the last few years...</i>"
"00:21:29,245","00:21:32,078","<i>... looking for me, but I've spent my entire life...</i>"
"00:21:32,325","00:21:33,758",<i>... looking for you.</i>
"00:21:35,245","00:21:37,315","<i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>"
"00:21:38,245","00:21:40,998",<i>- Yes. - Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>
"00:21:50,805","00:21:51,954",Get in.
"00:22:03,725","00:22:04,521",What's this?
"00:22:04,765","00:22:07,199","It's necessary, Neo. For our protection."
"00:22:07,445","00:22:08,400",From what?
"00:22:08,645","00:22:09,521",From you.
"00:22:11,005","00:22:12,404",Take off your shirt.
"00:22:12,885","00:22:13,681",Stop the car.
"00:22:18,085","00:22:19,200","Listen, coppertop."
"00:22:19,445","00:22:21,356",We don't have time for 20 Questions.
"00:22:21,845","00:22:24,120","Right now, there's only one rule:"
"00:22:24,405","00:22:25,679",Our way...
"00:22:26,005","00:22:27,040",...or the highway.
"00:22:33,525","00:22:34,355",Fine.
"00:22:36,165","00:22:38,520","Please, Neo, you have to trust me."
"00:22:39,085","00:22:41,599",- Why? - Because you have been down there.
"00:22:42,325","00:22:43,474",You know that road.
"00:22:44,445","00:22:46,037",You know exactly where it ends.
"00:22:48,125","00:22:50,275",And I know that's not where you want to be.
"00:23:03,885","00:23:05,364","Apoc, lights."
"00:23:07,765","00:23:09,835",Lie back. Lift up your shirt.
"00:23:11,685","00:23:12,481",What's that?
"00:23:12,805","00:23:13,840",You're bugged.
"00:23:21,285","00:23:22,684",Try and relax.
"00:23:28,725","00:23:29,840",Come on.
"00:23:31,005","00:23:31,835",Come on.
"00:23:33,565","00:23:34,441",It's on the move.
"00:23:36,205","00:23:37,354","Come on, you shit."
"00:23:39,125","00:23:41,320","- You're gonna lose it. - No, I'm not."
"00:23:41,565","00:23:42,475",Clear!
"00:23:50,725","00:23:52,761",Jesus Christ! That thing's real?!
"00:24:25,125","00:24:26,399",This is it.
"00:24:29,605","00:24:31,960",Let me give you one piece of advice.
"00:24:32,885","00:24:34,477",Be honest.
"00:24:36,005","00:24:38,121",He knows more than you can imagine.
"00:24:46,485","00:24:47,759",At last.
"00:24:49,245","00:24:50,280","Welcome, Neo."
"00:24:51,445","00:24:53,276",As you no doubt have guessed...
"00:24:53,525","00:24:54,719",...I am Morpheus.
"00:24:55,725","00:24:57,238",It's an honor to meet you.
"00:24:57,685","00:24:58,674",No...
"00:24:59,245","00:25:00,473",...the honor is mine.
"00:25:01,365","00:25:03,754","Please, come. Sit."
"00:25:18,245","00:25:19,803",I imagine...
"00:25:20,205","00:25:22,844",...that right now you're feeling a bit like Alice...
"00:25:24,485","00:25:26,794",...tumbling down the rabbit hole?
"00:25:27,685","00:25:28,640",You could say that.
"00:25:29,525","00:25:32,039",I can see it in your eyes.
"00:25:32,605","00:25:35,756",You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees...
"00:25:36,005","00:25:38,155",...because he's expecting to wake up.
"00:25:39,525","00:25:42,039","Ironically, this is not far from the truth."
"00:25:42,685","00:25:45,074","Do you believe in fate, Neo?"
"00:25:45,365","00:25:46,195",No.
"00:25:46,645","00:25:47,555",Why not?
"00:25:47,805","00:25:50,478",I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
"00:25:51,525","00:25:54,722",I know exactly what you mean.
"00:25:58,845","00:26:01,120",Let me tell you why you're here.
"00:26:02,125","00:26:03,604",You know something.
"00:26:04,125","00:26:05,683","What you know, you can't explain."
"00:26:06,165","00:26:07,678",But you feel it.
"00:26:08,245","00:26:10,076",You felt it your entire life.
"00:26:10,645","00:26:14,638","Something's wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there."
"00:26:15,125","00:26:17,241",Like a splinter in your mind...
"00:26:17,485","00:26:19,282",...driving you mad.
"00:26:20,165","00:26:22,804",It is this feeling that has brought you to me.
"00:26:25,245","00:26:26,997",Do you know what I'm talking about?
"00:26:28,765","00:26:30,039",The Matrix?
"00:26:32,445","00:26:34,037",Do you want to know...
"00:26:34,485","00:26:36,396",...what it is?
"00:26:38,685","00:26:40,482",The Matrix is everywhere.
"00:26:40,725","00:26:42,363",It is all around us.
"00:26:42,605","00:26:44,482","Even now, in this very room."
"00:26:45,285","00:26:47,401",You can see it when you look out your window...
"00:26:47,645","00:26:49,875",...or when you turn on your television.
"00:26:50,285","00:26:52,719",You can feel it when you go to work...
"00:26:54,205","00:26:55,797",...when you go to church...
"00:26:56,205","00:26:58,196",...when you pay your taxes.
"00:26:59,285","00:27:02,083",It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes...
"00:27:02,325","00:27:03,838",...to blind you from the truth.
"00:27:05,965","00:27:07,159",What truth?
"00:27:11,245","00:27:12,724",That you are a slave.
"00:27:14,165","00:27:16,360","Like everyone else, you were born into bondage..."
"00:27:16,605","00:27:21,076",...born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch.
"00:27:21,365","00:27:22,593",A prison...
"00:27:22,845","00:27:23,960",...for your mind.
"00:27:30,645","00:27:32,875","Unfortunately, no one can be..."
"00:27:33,205","00:27:35,480",...told what the Matrix is.
"00:27:38,805","00:27:40,602",You have to see it for yourself.
"00:27:49,725","00:27:51,920",This is your last chance.
"00:27:52,165","00:27:54,395","After this, there is no turning back."
"00:27:54,845","00:27:56,278",You take the blue pill...
"00:27:56,565","00:27:59,477","...the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe..."
"00:27:59,725","00:28:01,443",...whatever you want to believe.
"00:28:01,685","00:28:02,959",You take the red pill...
"00:28:03,205","00:28:05,082",...you stay in Wonderland...
"00:28:05,565","00:28:08,159",...and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
"00:28:17,645","00:28:18,794",Remember...
"00:28:19,605","00:28:22,517",...all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.
"00:28:36,245","00:28:37,519",Follow me.
"00:28:39,965","00:28:41,557","Apoc, are we on-line?"
"00:28:41,805","00:28:43,124",Almost.
"00:28:46,325","00:28:48,281",Time is always against us.
"00:28:48,645","00:28:50,078",Please take a seat there.
"00:29:07,525","00:29:09,163",You did all this?
"00:29:13,125","00:29:15,036",The pill you took is part of a trace program.
"00:29:15,765","00:29:20,202",It disrupts your carrier signals so we can pinpoint your location.
"00:29:20,725","00:29:21,714",What does that mean?
"00:29:22,285","00:29:24,355","It means buckle your seat belt, Dorothy..."
"00:29:24,685","00:29:25,959",...because Kansas...
"00:29:26,205","00:29:27,194",...is going bye-bye.
"00:30:03,565","00:30:04,884",Did you...?
"00:30:15,445","00:30:19,358","Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?"
"00:30:20,765","00:30:23,233",What if you were unable to wake from that dream?
"00:30:23,485","00:30:25,874",How would you know the difference between the dream world...
"00:30:26,485","00:30:27,838",...and the real world?
"00:30:29,405","00:30:30,554",This can't be.
"00:30:30,805","00:30:31,681",Be what?
"00:30:32,365","00:30:33,798",Be real?
"00:30:37,605","00:30:38,833",Going into replication.
"00:30:39,285","00:30:40,115",Still nothing.
"00:30:40,685","00:30:41,834",It's cold.
"00:30:42,085","00:30:43,404",It's cold!
"00:30:47,125","00:30:48,717","Tank, we'll need a signal soon."
"00:30:50,205","00:30:51,001",I got a fibrillation.
"00:30:51,245","00:30:52,724","Apoc, location."
"00:30:52,965","00:30:54,364",Targeting almost there.
"00:30:57,525","00:30:58,878",He's going into arrest.
"00:30:59,125","00:30:59,921",Lock. I got him!
"00:31:00,125","00:31:01,524","Now, Tank, now!"
"00:33:51,517","00:33:52,552",Welcome...
"00:33:52,877","00:33:54,708",...to the real world.
"00:33:56,077","00:33:57,829","We've done it, Trinity."
"00:33:58,077","00:33:59,556",We found him.
"00:33:59,797","00:34:02,470",- I hope you're right. - I don't have to hope.
"00:34:03,037","00:34:04,550",I know it.
"00:34:09,517","00:34:10,506",Am I dead?
"00:34:10,997","00:34:13,067",Far from it.
"00:34:26,477","00:34:27,830",He still needs a lot of work.
"00:34:29,317","00:34:30,352",What are you doing?
"00:34:30,597","00:34:32,713",Your muscles atrophied. We're rebuilding them.
"00:34:33,277","00:34:34,756",Why do my eyes hurt?
"00:34:35,437","00:34:37,234",You've never used them before.
"00:34:41,037","00:34:41,833","Rest, Neo."
"00:34:42,077","00:34:43,669",The answers are coming.
"00:35:55,197","00:35:56,710","Morpheus, what's happened to me?"
"00:35:57,437","00:35:58,347",What is this place?
"00:35:58,597","00:36:01,157","More important than ""what"" is ""when."""
"00:36:01,837","00:36:02,633",When?
"00:36:02,837","00:36:04,793",You believe it's the year 1999...
"00:36:05,037","00:36:07,187","...when in fact, it's closer to 2199."
"00:36:08,277","00:36:10,916",I can't tell you exactly what year it is...
"00:36:11,157","00:36:12,715",...because we honestly don't know.
"00:36:13,197","00:36:15,916",There's nothing I can say that will explain it for you.
"00:36:16,157","00:36:17,272",Come with me.
"00:36:17,557","00:36:18,785",See for yourself.
"00:36:19,317","00:36:20,989",This is my ship.
"00:36:21,277","00:36:24,075",<i>The Nebuchadnezzar. It's a hovercraft.</i>
"00:36:26,797","00:36:28,469",This is the main deck.
"00:36:34,237","00:36:35,192",This is the core...
"00:36:37,597","00:36:41,192",...where we broadcast our pirate signal and hack into the Matrix.
"00:36:44,437","00:36:47,474",Most of my crew you already know.
"00:36:52,277","00:36:53,630",This is Apoc...
"00:36:54,397","00:36:55,671",...Switch...
"00:36:57,197","00:36:58,312",...and Cypher.
"00:36:58,557","00:37:02,106","The ones you don't know: Tank and his big brother, Dozer."
"00:37:02,957","00:37:05,266",The little one behind you is Mouse.
"00:37:09,437","00:37:12,554",You wanted to know what the Matrix is?
"00:37:13,557","00:37:14,706",Trinity.
"00:37:34,877","00:37:36,390",Try to relax.
"00:37:41,077","00:37:42,829",This will feel a little weird.
"00:37:54,317","00:37:55,432",This...
"00:37:55,797","00:37:57,435",...is the Construct.
"00:37:57,837","00:37:59,873",It's our loading program.
"00:38:00,117","00:38:02,472","We can load anything, from clothing..."
"00:38:02,717","00:38:04,036",...to equipment...
"00:38:04,317","00:38:05,591",...weapons...
"00:38:06,197","00:38:07,949",...training simulations...
"00:38:08,317","00:38:10,751",...anything we need.
"00:38:13,437","00:38:15,746",Right now we're inside a computer program?
"00:38:16,037","00:38:17,868",Is it really so hard to believe?
"00:38:18,357","00:38:20,871",Your clothes are different. The plugs in your body are gone.
"00:38:22,037","00:38:24,028",Your hair has changed.
"00:38:24,397","00:38:27,594","Your appearance now is what we call ""residual self-image."""
"00:38:28,277","00:38:30,791",It is the mental projection of your digital self.
"00:38:36,437","00:38:37,506",This isn't real?
"00:38:37,757","00:38:39,236","What is ""real""?"
"00:38:39,597","00:38:41,747","How do you define ""real""?"
"00:38:42,037","00:38:43,868",If you're talking about what you can feel...
"00:38:44,117","00:38:46,426","...what you can smell, taste and see..."
"00:38:46,677","00:38:50,386","...then ""real"" is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain."
"00:38:54,397","00:38:56,706",This is the world that you know.
"00:38:58,077","00:39:00,989",The world as it was at the end of the 20th century.
"00:39:03,277","00:39:07,429",It exists now only as part of a neural-interactive simulation...
"00:39:07,677","00:39:08,871",...that we call the Matrix.
"00:39:13,237","00:39:15,956","You've been living in a dream world, Neo."
"00:39:16,877","00:39:17,946",This is the world...
"00:39:18,237","00:39:19,955",...as it exists today.
"00:39:32,437","00:39:35,270","Welcome to ""the desert..."
"00:39:36,117","00:39:37,630","...of the real."""
"00:39:40,877","00:39:43,152",We have only bits and pieces of information.
"00:39:43,397","00:39:47,026",But what we know for certain is that in the early 21 st century...
"00:39:47,277","00:39:50,394",...all of mankind was united in celebration.
"00:39:50,637","00:39:55,188",We marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to Al.
"00:39:55,957","00:39:57,026",Al.
"00:39:58,037","00:39:59,356",You mean artificial intelligence.
"00:39:59,597","00:40:03,829",A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines.
"00:40:04,637","00:40:07,947","We don't know who struck first, us or them."
"00:40:08,357","00:40:11,429",But we know that it was us that scorched the sky.
"00:40:13,037","00:40:15,107",They were dependent on solar power...
"00:40:15,357","00:40:18,554",...and it was believed that they would be unable to survive...
"00:40:18,877","00:40:22,233",...without an energy source as abundant as the sun.
"00:40:22,477","00:40:27,153","Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive."
"00:40:28,557","00:40:32,596","Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony."
"00:40:35,677","00:40:39,909",The human body generates more bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.
"00:40:40,157","00:40:44,116","And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat."
"00:40:45,957","00:40:48,027",Combined with a form of fusion...
"00:40:48,357","00:40:52,987",...the machines had found all the energy they would ever need.
"00:40:56,877","00:41:00,472","There are fields, Neo, endless fields..."
"00:41:00,717","00:41:03,834",...where human beings are no longer born.
"00:41:04,517","00:41:06,269",We are grown.
"00:41:12,077","00:41:14,545","For the longest time, I wouldn't believe it."
"00:41:14,797","00:41:17,357",And then I saw the fields with my own eyes...
"00:41:18,637","00:41:20,195",...watched them liquefy the dead...
"00:41:20,437","00:41:23,634",...so they could be fed intravenously to the living.
"00:41:24,157","00:41:28,230","And standing there, facing the pure, horrifying precision..."
"00:41:28,477","00:41:31,275",...I came to realize the obviousness of the truth.
"00:41:33,797","00:41:35,515",What is the Matrix?
"00:41:36,677","00:41:37,666",Control.
"00:41:38,997","00:41:42,228",The Matrix is a computer-generated dream world...
"00:41:42,997","00:41:45,955",...built to keep us under control...
"00:41:47,077","00:41:50,114",...in order to change a human being...
"00:41:50,717","00:41:51,832",...into this.
"00:41:53,157","00:41:54,226",No.
"00:41:55,797","00:41:57,310",I don't believe it.
"00:41:57,677","00:41:58,826",It's not possible.
"00:41:59,397","00:42:03,788","I didn't say it would be easy, Neo. I just said it would be the truth."
"00:42:04,037","00:42:04,833",Stop!
"00:42:05,797","00:42:06,946",Let me out!
"00:42:07,637","00:42:09,468",Let me out! I want out!
"00:42:11,357","00:42:13,917","- Easy, Neo. Easy. - Get this thing out of me."
"00:42:14,157","00:42:15,749",Get this thing out of me!
"00:42:17,477","00:42:18,910",Don't touch me!
"00:42:19,157","00:42:20,715",Stay away from me!
"00:42:21,117","00:42:22,550",I don't believe it.
"00:42:23,237","00:42:24,386",I don't believe it.
"00:42:24,637","00:42:25,592",I don't believe it.
"00:42:26,317","00:42:28,273","- He's gonna pop. - Breathe, Neo."
"00:42:28,837","00:42:29,667",Just breathe.
"00:42:47,317","00:42:49,035","I can't go back, can I?"
"00:42:49,957","00:42:50,867",No.
"00:42:51,997","00:42:53,146",But if you could...
"00:42:53,957","00:42:55,390",...would you really want to?
"00:42:57,797","00:42:59,150",I owe you an apology.
"00:42:59,677","00:43:00,996",We have a rule.
"00:43:01,437","00:43:04,668",We never free a mind once it's reached a certain age.
"00:43:04,917","00:43:05,747",It's dangerous.
"00:43:06,437","00:43:08,075",The mind has trouble letting go.
"00:43:08,317","00:43:10,512","I've seen it before, and I'm sorry."
"00:43:11,517","00:43:13,508",I did what I did because...
"00:43:14,197","00:43:15,596",...I had to.
"00:43:23,677","00:43:27,590","When the Matrix was first built, there was a man born inside..."
"00:43:28,077","00:43:31,706",...who had the ability to change whatever he wanted...
"00:43:32,077","00:43:34,875",...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.
"00:43:36,557","00:43:39,867",It was he who freed the first of us...
"00:43:40,717","00:43:42,275",...taught us the truth.
"00:43:43,677","00:43:46,635",As long as the Matrix exists...
"00:43:46,957","00:43:48,948",...the human race will never be free.
"00:43:52,997","00:43:54,476",After he died...
"00:43:55,197","00:43:57,791",...the Oracle prophesied his return...
"00:43:58,317","00:44:01,389",...and that his coming would hail the destruction of the Matrix...
"00:44:01,637","00:44:03,229",...end the war...
"00:44:03,557","00:44:04,706",...bring freedom to our people.
"00:44:06,037","00:44:10,474",That is why there are those of us who spent our lives searching the Matrix...
"00:44:10,797","00:44:12,310",...Iooking for him.
"00:44:14,637","00:44:16,628",I did what I did because...
"00:44:18,197","00:44:20,233",...I believe that search is over.
"00:44:25,117","00:44:26,470",Get some rest.
"00:44:27,077","00:44:28,795",You're going to need it.
"00:44:31,597","00:44:32,393",For what?
"00:44:35,517","00:44:36,472",Your training.
"00:44:54,037","00:44:55,675",Morning. Did you sleep?
"00:44:56,517","00:44:57,666",You will tonight.
"00:44:58,037","00:44:59,516",I guarantee it.
"00:45:00,957","00:45:02,788",I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.
"00:45:03,237","00:45:05,546",- You don't have any... - Holes? Nope.
"00:45:06,437","00:45:10,953","Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100% pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human."
"00:45:11,197","00:45:12,346",Born free right here...
"00:45:12,877","00:45:14,151",...in the real world.
"00:45:14,397","00:45:15,989",Genuine child of Zion.
"00:45:16,797","00:45:19,152",- Zion? - Lf the war was over tomorrow...
"00:45:19,397","00:45:20,750",...Zion's where the party would be.
"00:45:21,237","00:45:22,465",It's a city?
"00:45:22,717","00:45:25,754",The last human city. The only place we have left.
"00:45:27,277","00:45:28,471",Where is it?
"00:45:30,157","00:45:31,112",Deep underground...
"00:45:31,357","00:45:33,427","...near the Earth's core, where it's still warm."
"00:45:34,997","00:45:36,794","You live long enough, you might see it."
"00:45:38,957","00:45:43,587","Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited to see what you're capable of..."
"00:45:43,837","00:45:45,509",...if Morpheus is right and all.
"00:45:45,997","00:45:48,636","We're not supposed to talk about this, but..."
"00:45:48,877","00:45:50,230",...if you are...
"00:45:51,277","00:45:53,188",...it's a very exciting time.
"00:45:54,197","00:45:56,791",We got a lot to do. We gotta get to it.
"00:46:00,557","00:46:03,355",We're supposed to start with these programs first.
"00:46:04,317","00:46:07,627",That's major boring shit. Let's do something more fun.
"00:46:07,957","00:46:09,390",How about...
"00:46:10,877","00:46:12,549",...combat training?
"00:46:18,357","00:46:19,756","""Jujitsu""?"
"00:46:20,597","00:46:22,189",I'm going to learn jujitsu?
"00:46:33,077","00:46:34,226",Holy shit!
"00:46:34,477","00:46:36,707","""Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."""
"00:46:37,037","00:46:38,265",How about some more?
"00:46:38,517","00:46:39,745","Hell, yes."
"00:46:41,957","00:46:42,753","Hell, yeah."
"00:46:54,637","00:46:55,467",How is he?
"00:46:55,717","00:46:57,833",Ten hours straight. He's a machine.
"00:47:08,557","00:47:09,876",I know kung fu.
"00:47:11,677","00:47:12,473",Show me.
"00:47:14,157","00:47:15,829",This is a sparring program...
"00:47:16,077","00:47:18,750",...similar to the programmed reality of the Matrix.
"00:47:18,997","00:47:21,227",It has the same basic rules. Like gravity.
"00:47:21,477","00:47:24,787",These rules are no different than those of a computer system.
"00:47:25,317","00:47:26,750",Some of them can be bent.
"00:47:26,957","00:47:27,753",Others...
"00:47:27,997","00:47:29,316",...can be broken.
"00:47:29,957","00:47:30,867",Understand?
"00:47:32,117","00:47:32,947",Then hit me...
"00:47:33,477","00:47:34,546",...if you can.
"00:48:12,513","00:48:12,945",Good!
"00:48:13,673","00:48:14,788",Adaptation.
"00:48:15,073","00:48:16,222",Improvisation.
"00:48:16,513","00:48:17,787",But your weakness...
"00:48:18,033","00:48:19,352",...is not your technique.
"00:48:26,033","00:48:28,024",Morpheus is fighting Neo.
"00:49:37,353","00:49:38,468",How did I beat you?
"00:49:44,793","00:49:45,828",You're too fast.
"00:49:46,353","00:49:47,627",Do you believe that...
"00:49:47,993","00:49:50,382",...my being stronger or faster...
"00:49:50,633","00:49:54,148",...has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
"00:49:58,033","00:49:59,751",You think you're breathing air?
"00:50:12,713","00:50:13,862",Again!
"00:50:24,873","00:50:27,182","Jesus Christ, he's fast!"
"00:50:27,433","00:50:29,549",His neuro-kinetics are way above normal.
"00:50:34,793","00:50:36,192",What are you waiting for?
"00:50:36,433","00:50:38,310",You're faster than this.
"00:50:40,433","00:50:42,549",Don't think you are.
"00:50:42,793","00:50:44,385",Know you are.
"00:50:54,353","00:50:57,072","Come on! Stop trying to hit me, and hit me!"
"00:51:06,553","00:51:08,225",I don't believe it.
"00:51:09,713","00:51:11,749",I know what you're trying to do.
"00:51:13,353","00:51:15,423","I'm trying to free your mind, Neo."
"00:51:15,753","00:51:17,744",But I can only show you the door.
"00:51:18,313","00:51:20,144",You have to walk through it.
"00:51:22,353","00:51:24,389","Tank, load the jump program."
"00:51:35,513","00:51:38,107","You have to let it all go, Neo. Fear..."
"00:51:38,633","00:51:40,703",...doubt and disbelief.
"00:51:41,833","00:51:44,427",Free your mind.
"00:51:59,953","00:52:01,591",Okey-dokey.
"00:52:03,593","00:52:04,708",Free my mind.
"00:52:05,273","00:52:06,228",What if he makes it?
"00:52:06,473","00:52:09,067",- No one's ever made their first jump. - I know.
"00:52:10,353","00:52:12,708",- But what if he does? - He won't.
"00:52:13,513","00:52:14,309",Come on.
"00:52:14,553","00:52:15,668",All right.
"00:52:16,113","00:52:18,069",No problem. Free my mind.
"00:52:18,833","00:52:21,506",Free my mind. No problem. Right.
"00:52:40,113","00:52:41,705",What does that mean?
"00:52:42,073","00:52:43,825",It doesn't mean anything.
"00:52:44,393","00:52:46,861",Everybody falls the first time.
"00:52:47,313","00:52:48,541","Right, Trin?"
"00:53:08,393","00:53:10,907",- I thought it wasn't real. - Your mind makes it real.
"00:53:14,033","00:53:16,183",If you're killed in the Matrix...
"00:53:16,553","00:53:17,349",...you die here?
"00:53:17,953","00:53:20,308",The body cannot live without the mind.
"00:53:49,553","00:53:52,784",I don't remember you ever bringing me dinner.
"00:53:55,753","00:53:58,472","There is something about him, isn't there?"
"00:53:59,073","00:54:00,631",You're a believer now?
"00:54:01,593","00:54:02,742",I keep wondering...
"00:54:02,993","00:54:06,508","...if Morpheus is so sure, why not take him to see the Oracle?"
"00:54:07,393","00:54:10,191",Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
"00:54:19,593","00:54:21,072","The Matrix is a system, Neo."
"00:54:22,753","00:54:23,981",That system is our enemy.
"00:54:24,593","00:54:26,823","But when you're inside, what do you see?"
"00:54:27,073","00:54:30,702","Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters."
"00:54:31,153","00:54:33,621",The very minds of the people we are trying to save.
"00:54:33,873","00:54:36,706","But until we do, these people are a part of that system..."
"00:54:36,953","00:54:38,784",...and that makes them our enemy.
"00:54:39,153","00:54:40,108",You have to understand...
"00:54:40,353","00:54:43,550",...most of these people are not ready to be unplugged.
"00:54:43,793","00:54:45,306",And many of them are so inert...
"00:54:45,553","00:54:46,673",...so hopelessly dependent on the system...
"00:54:46,673","00:54:47,867",...so hopelessly dependent on the system...
"00:54:48,113","00:54:50,707",...that they will fight to protect it.
"00:54:52,153","00:54:55,748",Were you listening to me or looking at the woman in the red dress?
"00:54:56,713","00:54:57,589",Look again.
"00:54:58,793","00:54:59,828",Freeze it.
"00:55:06,193","00:55:07,751",This isn't the Matrix?
"00:55:09,473","00:55:13,148",It's another training program designed to teach you one thing:
"00:55:13,753","00:55:16,062","If you are not one of us, you are one of them."
"00:55:16,593","00:55:19,266",- What are they? - Sentient programs.
"00:55:19,993","00:55:24,111",They can move in and out of any software still hardwired to their system.
"00:55:24,473","00:55:27,704",That means that anyone we haven't unplugged...
"00:55:28,033","00:55:29,307",...is potentially an agent.
"00:55:30,233","00:55:31,985",Inside the Matrix...
"00:55:32,553","00:55:34,191",...they are everyone...
"00:55:34,513","00:55:36,151",...and they are no one.
"00:55:36,393","00:55:39,385",We have survived by hiding and running from them...
"00:55:39,633","00:55:41,191",...but they are the gatekeepers.
"00:55:41,433","00:55:44,266",They're guarding all the doors and holding all the keys.
"00:55:44,513","00:55:47,232","Sooner or later, someone will have to fight them."
"00:55:47,593","00:55:48,548",Someone?
"00:55:48,873","00:55:50,226","I won't lie to you, Neo."
"00:55:50,673","00:55:55,303",Every single man or woman who has fought an agent has died.
"00:55:55,553","00:55:57,828","But where they have failed, you will succeed."
"00:55:58,233","00:55:59,029",Why?
"00:55:59,273","00:56:01,468",I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.
"00:56:01,713","00:56:05,149",Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit nothing but air.
"00:56:05,393","00:56:09,830",Yet their strength and speed are still based in a world built on rules.
"00:56:10,073","00:56:11,142",Because of that...
"00:56:11,393","00:56:14,624",...they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
"00:56:18,753","00:56:20,550",What are you telling me?
"00:56:21,233","00:56:22,632",That I can dodge bullets?
"00:56:24,553","00:56:25,872","No, Neo."
"00:56:26,353","00:56:29,151",I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready...
"00:56:29,993","00:56:31,312",...you won't have to.
"00:56:35,633","00:56:36,429",<i>We got trouble.</i>
"00:56:54,553","00:56:55,872",Did Zion send the warning?
"00:56:56,113","00:56:56,909","No, another ship."
"00:57:00,033","00:57:01,261",Shit.
"00:57:01,513","00:57:03,185",Squiddy's sweeping in quick.
"00:57:03,473","00:57:04,269",Squiddy?
"00:57:04,473","00:57:07,545",A sentinel. A killing machine designed for one thing.
"00:57:07,793","00:57:08,942",Search and destroy.
"00:57:10,233","00:57:11,348",Set her down there.
"00:57:32,273","00:57:33,183","How are we doing, Tank?"
"00:57:41,553","00:57:42,668",Power off-line.
"00:57:43,153","00:57:45,064",EMP armed...
"00:57:45,553","00:57:47,032",...and ready.
"00:57:47,313","00:57:49,110",Electromagnetic pulse.
"00:57:49,353","00:57:52,106",Disables any electrical system in the blast radius.
"00:57:52,353","00:57:54,469",It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
"00:58:00,033","00:58:00,829",Where are we?
"00:58:01,073","00:58:03,029",Their old service and waste systems.
"00:58:04,513","00:58:05,309",Sewers.
"00:58:05,513","00:58:08,107",There used to be cities that spanned hundreds of miles.
"00:58:08,593","00:58:10,424",Now these sewers are all that's left.
"00:58:10,673","00:58:11,947",Quiet.
"00:58:54,012","00:58:56,082",You scared the bejesus out of me.
"00:58:57,132","00:58:58,963",- Sorry. - It's okay.
"00:59:01,772","00:59:02,568",Is that...?
"00:59:02,812","00:59:04,325",The Matrix?
"00:59:07,372","00:59:10,409","- Do you always look at it encoded? - Well, you have to."
"00:59:10,652","00:59:13,610",The image translators work for the construct program.
"00:59:13,852","00:59:17,128",But there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.
"00:59:17,372","00:59:20,205",You get used to it. I don't even see the code.
"00:59:20,452","00:59:23,728","All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead."
"00:59:24,852","00:59:26,171",Do you...
"00:59:26,452","00:59:27,487",...want a drink?
"00:59:27,732","00:59:28,721",Sure.
"00:59:32,132","00:59:33,531",You know...
"00:59:34,412","00:59:35,891",...I know what you're thinking.
"00:59:36,132","00:59:38,168",Because right now I'm thinking the same thing.
"00:59:38,452","00:59:41,649","Actually, I've been thinking it ever since I got here."
"00:59:43,492","00:59:46,370","Why, oh, why didn't I take the blue pill?"
"00:59:58,252","01:00:00,083","Good shit, huh?"
"01:00:00,412","01:00:01,561",Dozer makes it.
"01:00:02,012","01:00:03,127",It's good for two things:
"01:00:03,372","01:00:06,330",Degreasing engines and killing brain cells.
"01:00:07,292","01:00:09,408",So can I ask you something?
"01:00:12,292","01:00:13,850",Did he tell you why he did it?
"01:00:16,372","01:00:18,124",Why you're here?
"01:00:21,652","01:00:23,324",Jesus!
"01:00:24,492","01:00:26,323",What a mind job.
"01:00:27,692","01:00:30,365",So you're here to save the world.
"01:00:31,812","01:00:33,803",What do you say to something like that?
"01:00:38,772","01:00:40,091",A little piece of advice.
"01:00:41,812","01:00:43,165",You see an agent...
"01:00:43,492","01:00:45,687",...you do what we do:
"01:00:46,012","01:00:47,491",Run.
"01:00:47,812","01:00:49,484",You run your ass off.
"01:00:56,452","01:00:58,090",Thanks for the drink.
"01:01:02,612","01:01:03,727",Sweet dreams.
"01:01:07,572","01:01:10,848","Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?"
"01:01:11,492","01:01:12,561",You know...
"01:01:13,932","01:01:16,287",...I know this steak doesn't exist.
"01:01:17,252","01:01:19,891",I know that when I put it in my mouth...
"01:01:20,132","01:01:23,090",...the Matrix is telling my brain that it is...
"01:01:23,372","01:01:24,441",...juicy...
"01:01:24,732","01:01:26,370",...and delicious.
"01:01:29,172","01:01:30,366",After nine years...
"01:01:31,372","01:01:32,851",...you know what I realize?
"01:01:40,372","01:01:41,521",Ignorance is bliss.
"01:01:46,372","01:01:48,124",Then we have a deal.
"01:01:50,532","01:01:52,363",I don't want to remember nothing.
"01:01:52,612","01:01:53,408",Nothing.
"01:01:53,932","01:01:55,047",You understand?
"01:01:58,932","01:02:00,650",And I want to be rich.
"01:02:01,932","01:02:04,526","You know, someone important."
"01:02:05,972","01:02:07,041",Like an actor.
"01:02:08,212","01:02:11,204","Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan."
"01:02:13,292","01:02:14,771",Okay.
"01:02:15,132","01:02:17,441",You get my body back in a power plant...
"01:02:17,812","01:02:19,484",...reinsert me into the Matrix...
"01:02:19,812","01:02:21,165",...I'll get you what you want.
"01:02:21,412","01:02:23,323",Access codes to the Zion mainframe.
"01:02:23,572","01:02:25,642","No. I told you, I don't know them."
"01:02:28,492","01:02:30,403",I can get you the man who does.
"01:02:31,132","01:02:32,850",Morpheus.
"01:02:42,532","01:02:45,842","Here you go, buddy. Breakfast of champions."
"01:02:47,132","01:02:49,805","Close your eyes, it feels like you're eating runny eggs."
"01:02:50,052","01:02:50,848",Or a bowl of snot.
"01:02:52,172","01:02:53,685",You know what it reminds me of?
"01:02:55,452","01:02:57,682",Tastee Wheat. Did you ever eat Tastee Wheat?
"01:02:58,292","01:02:59,930","No, but technically, neither did you."
"01:03:00,172","01:03:02,128",That's exactly my point. Exactly.
"01:03:02,372","01:03:03,691",Because you have to wonder...
"01:03:03,932","01:03:07,049",...how do the machines really know what Tastee Wheat tasted like?
"01:03:07,292","01:03:08,645",Maybe they got it wrong.
"01:03:08,892","01:03:11,964",Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat tasted like actually tasted like...
"01:03:12,252","01:03:14,163",...oatmeal or tuna fish.
"01:03:14,532","01:03:17,251","That makes you wonder. Take chicken, for example."
"01:03:17,492","01:03:19,403",Maybe they didn't know what to make it taste like...
"01:03:19,652","01:03:21,608",...which is why it tastes like everything.
"01:03:21,852","01:03:23,570",- And maybe they... - Shut up.
"01:03:25,132","01:03:26,531",It's a single-celled protein...
"01:03:26,772","01:03:29,684","...combined with synthetic aminos, vitamins and minerals."
"01:03:29,932","01:03:31,126",Everything the body needs.
"01:03:31,372","01:03:34,125",It doesn't have everything the body needs.
"01:03:36,772","01:03:39,730",I understand you've run through the agent training program.
"01:03:40,732","01:03:42,688","You know, I wrote that program."
"01:03:42,972","01:03:44,200",Here it comes.
"01:03:44,452","01:03:46,329",- What did you think of her? - Of who?
"01:03:46,692","01:03:49,604",The woman in the red dress. I designed her.
"01:03:49,932","01:03:52,571",She doesn't talk very much...
"01:03:52,812","01:03:56,600","...but if you'd like to meet her, I can arrange a more personal milieu."
"01:03:56,852","01:03:58,171",The digital pimp hard at work.
"01:03:58,412","01:04:00,562","Pay no attention to these hypocrites, Neo."
"01:04:01,812","01:04:03,564",To deny our own impulses...
"01:04:03,812","01:04:06,804",...is to deny the very thing that makes us human.
"01:04:08,652","01:04:09,971","Dozer, when you're done..."
"01:04:10,212","01:04:11,565",...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.
"01:04:12,252","01:04:13,526",We're going in.
"01:04:14,212","01:04:15,565",I'm taking Neo to see her.
"01:04:19,732","01:04:20,528",See who?
"01:04:21,492","01:04:22,686",The Oracle.
"01:04:27,972","01:04:29,451","Everyone, please observe..."
"01:04:29,772","01:04:32,366","...the ""fasten seat belt"" and ""no smoking"" signs are on."
"01:04:32,852","01:04:36,083",Sit back and enjoy your flight.
"01:04:59,612","01:05:00,408",We're in.
"01:05:15,492","01:05:16,561",We'll be back in an hour.
"01:05:30,772","01:05:32,125",Unbelievable...
"01:05:32,932","01:05:34,206",...isn't it?
"01:05:37,652","01:05:39,404",- God! - What?
"01:05:40,052","01:05:41,371",I used to eat there.
"01:05:43,532","01:05:45,090",Really good noodles.
"01:05:49,692","01:05:52,081",I have these memories from my life.
"01:05:54,452","01:05:56,044",None of them happened.
"01:05:57,052","01:05:57,928",What does that mean?
"01:05:58,172","01:06:00,288",That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
"01:06:01,172","01:06:02,321",But an oracle can?
"01:06:02,772","01:06:03,921",That's different.
"01:06:08,812","01:06:09,642",Did you go to her?
"01:06:11,132","01:06:12,247",Yes.
"01:06:12,732","01:06:14,051",What did she tell you?
"01:06:17,172","01:06:18,605",She told me...
"01:06:19,612","01:06:20,727",What?
"01:06:24,372","01:06:25,646",We're here.
"01:06:26,852","01:06:28,205",Come with me.
"01:06:47,372","01:06:49,932",So is this the same oracle that made...
"01:06:50,252","01:06:51,048",...the prophecy?
"01:06:51,292","01:06:55,444",Yes. She's very old. She's been with us since the beginning.
"01:06:55,892","01:06:56,688",The beginning?
"01:06:56,892","01:06:57,802",Of the Resistance.
"01:06:59,972","01:07:02,247",And she knows what? Everything?
"01:07:04,212","01:07:06,043",She would say she knows enough.
"01:07:07,132","01:07:08,850",And she's never wrong.
"01:07:10,972","01:07:14,009",Try not to think of it in terms of right and wrong.
"01:07:14,332","01:07:15,845","She is a guide, Neo."
"01:07:16,212","01:07:18,009",She can help you to find the path.
"01:07:18,772","01:07:19,682",She helped you?
"01:07:22,092","01:07:23,366",What did she tell you?
"01:07:25,732","01:07:27,848",That I would find the One.
"01:07:40,452","01:07:42,488",I told you I can only show you the door.
"01:07:43,172","01:07:45,163",You have to walk through it.
"01:07:48,812","01:07:49,847","Hello, Neo."
"01:07:50,092","01:07:51,684",You're right on time.
"01:07:59,292","01:08:02,921","Make yourself at home, Morpheus. Neo, come with me."
"01:08:08,372","01:08:09,885",These are the other Potentials.
"01:08:10,132","01:08:11,611",You can wait here.
"01:08:50,772","01:08:53,206",Do not try and bend the spoon.
"01:08:53,572","01:08:55,608",That's impossible.
"01:08:56,412","01:09:00,246","Instead, only try to realize the truth."
"01:09:00,772","01:09:02,091",What truth?
"01:09:02,332","01:09:03,924",There is no spoon.
"01:09:06,412","01:09:07,686",There is no spoon?
"01:09:07,932","01:09:12,244",Then you'll see that it is not the spoon that bends. It is only yourself.
"01:09:27,612","01:09:29,045",The Oracle will you see now.
"01:09:39,292","01:09:40,771",I know you're Neo.
"01:09:41,372","01:09:42,487",Be right with you.
"01:09:43,492","01:09:44,447",You're the Oracle?
"01:09:44,812","01:09:45,767",Bingo.
"01:09:48,372","01:09:51,125","Not quite what you were expecting, right?"
"01:09:52,132","01:09:54,202",Almost done.
"01:09:56,612","01:09:58,170","Smell good, don't they?"
"01:10:00,812","01:10:02,564",I'd ask you to sit down...
"01:10:02,812","01:10:05,087",...but you're not going to anyway.
"01:10:05,572","01:10:07,324",And don't worry about the vase.
"01:10:07,532","01:10:08,328",What vase?
"01:10:11,332","01:10:12,447",That vase.
"01:10:13,372","01:10:14,361",I'm sorry.
"01:10:14,612","01:10:16,409","I said, don't worry about it."
"01:10:17,532","01:10:19,409",I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
"01:10:20,012","01:10:21,161",How did you know?
"01:10:23,132","01:10:26,761",What's really going to bake your noodle later on is...
"01:10:27,092","01:10:29,925",...would you still have broken it if I hadn't said anything?
"01:10:34,532","01:10:36,363",You're cuter than I thought.
"01:10:39,292","01:10:41,442",I can see why she likes you.
"01:10:42,292","01:10:43,327",Who?
"01:10:43,572","01:10:45,324","Not too bright, though."
"01:10:48,492","01:10:51,450",You know why Morpheus brought you to see me.
"01:10:53,492","01:10:54,607",So...
"01:10:55,532","01:10:56,851",...what do you think?
"01:10:58,612","01:11:00,284",Do you think you are the One?
"01:11:02,172","01:11:03,161",I don't know.
"01:11:06,452","01:11:07,805",You know what that means?
"01:11:08,612","01:11:09,727",It's Latin.
"01:11:10,092","01:11:12,208","Means, ""Know thyself."""
"01:11:13,612","01:11:15,489",I'll let you in on a little secret.
"01:11:17,652","01:11:21,327",Being the One is just like being in love.
"01:11:22,012","01:11:24,765",No one can tell you you're in love. You just know it...
"01:11:25,012","01:11:26,081",...through and through.
"01:11:26,412","01:11:28,368",Balls to bones.
"01:11:30,812","01:11:31,608",Well...
"01:11:33,492","01:11:35,483",...I'd better have a look at you.
"01:11:36,772","01:11:38,205","Open your mouth. Say, ""Ah."""
"01:11:52,012","01:11:53,604",Okay...
"01:11:54,212","01:11:58,967","Now I'm supposed to say, ""Hmm, that's interesting, but..."""
"01:11:59,452","01:12:00,521",Then you say:
"01:12:01,372","01:12:02,327",But what?
"01:12:02,572","01:12:06,360",But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
"01:12:07,732","01:12:08,687",I'm not the One.
"01:12:08,932","01:12:10,570","Sorry, kid."
"01:12:12,132","01:12:14,043",You got the gift...
"01:12:15,012","01:12:17,128",...but it looks like you're waiting for something.
"01:12:21,812","01:12:22,608",What?
"01:12:22,812","01:12:25,610","Your next life, maybe. Who knows?"
"01:12:26,172","01:12:28,322",That's the way these things go.
"01:12:29,172","01:12:30,002",What's funny?
"01:12:30,372","01:12:31,646",Morpheus.
"01:12:34,972","01:12:36,610",He almost had me convinced.
"01:12:36,852","01:12:37,921",I know.
"01:12:39,412","01:12:41,448",Poor Morpheus.
"01:12:43,732","01:12:46,724","Without him, we're lost."
"01:12:48,212","01:12:50,282","What do you mean, ""without him""?"
"01:12:54,132","01:12:55,963",Are you sure you want to hear this?
"01:12:58,092","01:13:00,731","Morpheus believes in you, Neo."
"01:13:02,372","01:13:04,442","And no one, not you, not even me..."
"01:13:04,692","01:13:06,842",...can convince him otherwise.
"01:13:07,212","01:13:09,487",He believes it so blindly...
"01:13:09,772","01:13:13,924",...that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
"01:13:14,172","01:13:14,968",What?
"01:13:15,172","01:13:17,970",You're going to have to make a choice.
"01:13:18,572","01:13:22,008","In the one hand, you'll have Morpheus' life."
"01:13:22,492","01:13:25,245","And in the other hand, you'll have your own."
"01:13:26,612","01:13:28,807",One of you is going to die.
"01:13:30,812","01:13:33,963",Which one will be up to you.
"01:13:35,292","01:13:37,123","I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am."
"01:13:37,372","01:13:38,964",You have a good soul.
"01:13:40,012","01:13:42,606",And I hate giving good people bad news.
"01:13:45,612","01:13:47,011",Don't worry about it.
"01:13:47,252","01:13:49,561",As soon as you step outside that door...
"01:13:49,812","01:13:51,848",...you'll start feeling better.
"01:13:52,532","01:13:56,161",You'll remember you don't believe in any of this fate crap.
"01:13:56,972","01:13:59,611",You're in control of your own life.
"01:14:00,412","01:14:01,640",Remember?
"01:14:03,452","01:14:04,407",Here...
"01:14:06,212","01:14:07,691",...take a cookie.
"01:14:08,212","01:14:11,409","I promise, by the time you're done eating it..."
"01:14:12,332","01:14:14,607",...you'll feel right as rain.
"01:14:23,452","01:14:24,726",What was said...
"01:14:25,332","01:14:26,731",...was for you...
"01:14:27,252","01:14:29,004",...and for you alone.
"01:14:51,012","01:14:52,081",They're on the way.
"01:15:20,852","01:15:21,648",What is that?
"01:15:35,812","01:15:37,165","Oh, déjà vu."
"01:15:40,532","01:15:41,567",What did you just say?
"01:15:41,812","01:15:43,245",Nothing. Just déjà vu.
"01:15:43,492","01:15:45,050",- What did you see? - What happened?
"01:15:46,412","01:15:48,482",A black cat went past us...
"01:15:48,732","01:15:50,290",...then another just like it.
"01:15:50,532","01:15:52,011",Was it the same cat?
"01:15:53,132","01:15:54,087",I'm not sure.
"01:15:54,852","01:15:55,648","Switch, Apoc."
"01:15:59,932","01:16:00,728",What is it?
"01:16:00,972","01:16:05,204",A déjà vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix when they change something.
"01:16:08,452","01:16:09,248","Oh, my God."
"01:16:11,012","01:16:11,922",Let's go.
"01:16:16,972","01:16:18,644",They cut the hard line. It's a trap! Get out!
"01:16:24,332","01:16:25,128","Oh, no."
"01:17:03,764","01:17:06,119",That's what they changed. We're trapped.
"01:17:06,364","01:17:08,161",Be calm. Give me your phone.
"01:17:08,404","01:17:09,883",They'll be able to track it.
"01:17:10,124","01:17:11,477",We have no choice.
"01:17:12,844","01:17:13,993",Operator.
"01:17:14,324","01:17:17,043",<i>Find a structural drawing of this building. Find it fast.</i>
"01:17:24,564","01:17:27,032",<i>- Got it! - I need the main wet-wall.</i>
"01:17:30,164","01:17:30,960",Eighth floor.
"01:17:31,164","01:17:32,677",<i>They're on the eighth floor.</i>
"01:17:32,964","01:17:34,363","Switch, straight ahead."
"01:17:42,084","01:17:44,234",I hope the Oracle gave you some good news.
"01:17:52,084","01:17:53,517",<i>Now left. That's it.</i>
"01:17:53,804","01:17:54,793",Good.
"01:18:04,124","01:18:05,352",Where are they?
"01:19:03,324","01:19:04,439",They're in the walls.
"01:19:05,844","01:19:06,959",In the walls!
"01:19:27,484","01:19:28,280",It's an agent!
"01:19:37,684","01:19:38,639",You must get Neo out!
"01:19:38,964","01:19:40,716",He's all that matters!
"01:19:41,004","01:19:42,153","No, Morpheus! Don't!"
"01:19:42,404","01:19:43,200","Trinity, go!"
"01:19:44,044","01:19:45,363",Go!
"01:19:51,324","01:19:53,155",- We can't leave him! - We have to!
"01:20:17,404","01:20:18,200",Come on!
"01:20:23,321","01:20:25,039",The great Morpheus. We meet at last.
"01:20:27,120","01:20:28,189",And you are?
"01:20:28,440","01:20:30,112",A Smith.
"01:20:30,360","01:20:31,588",Agent Smith.
"01:20:32,160","01:20:34,116",You all look the same to me.
"01:21:27,477","01:21:28,705",Take him.
"01:21:41,397","01:21:43,149","<i>- Operator. - I need an exit, fast.</i>"
"01:21:45,157","01:21:47,955",There was an accident. Goddamn car accident.
"01:21:48,277","01:21:49,995","<i>All of a sudden, boom.</i>"
"01:21:50,237","01:21:51,556",Somebody up there still likes me.
"01:21:51,797","01:21:52,991",I got you.
"01:21:53,477","01:21:55,308",<i>Just get me out of here fast.</i>
"01:21:55,557","01:21:58,117","Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie. An old TV repair shop."
"01:21:58,357","01:21:59,346",Right.
"01:22:02,357","01:22:03,870","<i>- Operator. - Tank, it's me.</i>"
"01:22:04,117","01:22:05,232",Is Morpheus alive?
"01:22:05,597","01:22:06,825","Is Morpheus alive, Tank?"
"01:22:07,237","01:22:09,068",<i>Yes. They're moving him. I don 't know where.</i>
"01:22:09,277","01:22:11,472",He's alive. We need an exit.
"01:22:11,717","01:22:12,593",You're not far from Cypher.
"01:22:12,837","01:22:14,111",<i>- Cypher? - I know.</i>
"01:22:14,357","01:22:16,348",<i>- I sent him to Franklin and Erie. - Got it.</i>
"01:22:25,077","01:22:26,226",Got him.
"01:22:36,717","01:22:37,706",Where are they?
"01:22:37,957","01:22:39,151",Making the call.
"01:22:39,797","01:22:40,912",Good.
"01:22:53,917","01:22:54,713",You first.
"01:22:57,757","01:22:58,553",Shit!
"01:23:07,277","01:23:09,347",I don't know. It just went dead.
"01:23:35,077","01:23:36,226","<i>Hello, Trinity.</i>"
"01:23:36,637","01:23:37,911",Cypher? Where's Tank?
"01:23:43,277","01:23:44,266",You know...
"01:23:45,917","01:23:47,953",...for a long time...
"01:23:49,117","01:23:51,915",...I thought I was in love with you.
"01:23:52,637","01:23:54,593",<i>I used to dream about you.</i>
"01:23:55,637","01:23:58,231","You're a beautiful woman, Trinity."
"01:23:58,477","01:24:00,752",<i>Too bad things had to turn out this way.</i>
"01:24:01,477","01:24:02,273",You killed them.
"01:24:02,757","01:24:04,190","- What? - Oh, God."
"01:24:04,437","01:24:05,790","I'm tired, Trinity."
"01:24:07,157","01:24:08,954",I'm tired of this war...
"01:24:09,237","01:24:11,956",...tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship...
"01:24:12,277","01:24:16,714","...of being cold, of eating the same goddamn goop every day."
"01:24:19,037","01:24:19,913",But most of all...
"01:24:20,477","01:24:23,708",<i>... I'm tired of that jackoff and all of his bullshit.</i>
"01:24:24,797","01:24:26,025","Surprise, asshole!"
"01:24:26,557","01:24:28,673",I bet you never saw this coming...
"01:24:28,917","01:24:29,906",...did you?
"01:24:32,117","01:24:34,392","God, I wish I could be there..."
"01:24:34,957","01:24:36,390",...when they break you.
"01:24:37,397","01:24:40,434",I wish I could walk in just when it happens...
"01:24:41,117","01:24:42,755",...so right then...
"01:24:42,997","01:24:44,271",...you'd know it was me.
"01:24:44,957","01:24:45,867",You gave them Morpheus.
"01:24:46,117","01:24:47,516","<i>He lied to us, Trinity.</i>"
"01:24:48,077","01:24:49,510",He tricked us!
"01:24:50,037","01:24:51,948",If you had told us the truth...
"01:24:52,197","01:24:54,950",...we would've told you to shove that red pill up your ass!
"01:24:55,197","01:24:57,233","That is not true, Cypher. He set us free."
"01:24:57,477","01:24:58,353","<i>""Free.""</i>"
"01:24:58,597","01:25:00,235",You call this free?
"01:25:02,557","01:25:04,946",All I do is what he tells me to do.
"01:25:06,477","01:25:09,275",If I had to choose between that and the Matrix...
"01:25:10,397","01:25:11,546",...I choose the Matrix.
"01:25:11,797","01:25:13,389",The Matrix isn't real.
"01:25:13,637","01:25:14,990","<i>I disagree, Trinity.</i>"
"01:25:15,237","01:25:17,387",I think the Matrix...
"01:25:17,717","01:25:20,185",...can be more real than this world.
"01:25:22,277","01:25:24,666",All I do is pull the plug here.
"01:25:25,237","01:25:26,192",But there...
"01:25:26,717","01:25:28,912",<i>... you have to watch Apoc die.</i>
"01:25:36,357","01:25:37,995",<i>Welcome to the real world.</i>
"01:25:38,317","01:25:39,193",But you're out.
"01:25:39,437","01:25:41,746",<i>- You can 't go back. - That's what you think.</i>
"01:25:41,997","01:25:43,430",<i>They'll reinsert my body.</i>
"01:25:43,677","01:25:47,147","<i>I go back to sleep. When I wake up, I won 't remember a thing.</i>"
"01:25:47,397","01:25:48,352",By the way...
"01:25:48,597","01:25:51,430",...if you have anything important to say to Switch...
"01:25:51,917","01:25:52,952",<i>... say it now.</i>
"01:25:53,197","01:25:54,027","No, please don't."
"01:25:54,557","01:25:56,115",Not like this.
"01:25:57,757","01:25:59,315",Not like this.
"01:26:03,597","01:26:04,586",Too late.
"01:26:04,957","01:26:06,549","Goddamn you, Cypher!"
"01:26:06,797","01:26:08,594","Don't hate me, Trinity."
"01:26:08,957","01:26:10,754",I'm just a messenger.
"01:26:11,157","01:26:14,194","And right now, I'm going to prove it to you."
"01:26:15,237","01:26:16,829",If Morpheus was right...
"01:26:17,357","01:26:19,154",...there's no way I can pull this plug.
"01:26:19,717","01:26:21,150",<i>If Neo 's the One...</i>
"01:26:21,637","01:26:23,389",<i>... then there'd have to be...</i>
"01:26:23,637","01:26:26,105",...some kind of a miracle to stop me.
"01:26:26,597","01:26:27,427",Right?
"01:26:28,037","01:26:30,107","I mean, how can he be the One..."
"01:26:30,397","01:26:31,227",...if he's dead?
"01:26:32,557","01:26:34,707",<i>You never did answer me before...</i>
"01:26:34,997","01:26:37,227",<i>... if you bought into Morpheus ' bullshit.</i>
"01:26:37,597","01:26:40,669",Come on. All I want is a little yes or no.
"01:26:41,997","01:26:44,227",Look into his eyes...
"01:26:44,957","01:26:46,390","<i>... those big, pretty eyes...</i>"
"01:26:49,037","01:26:50,311",...and tell me...
"01:26:50,997","01:26:52,225",<i>... yes...</i>
"01:26:52,517","01:26:53,836",<i>... or no.</i>
"01:26:55,077","01:26:56,146",Yes.
"01:26:56,957","01:26:57,833",I don't believe it.
"01:26:59,197","01:27:03,748","Believe it or not, you piece of shit, you're still going to burn!"
"01:27:21,677","01:27:22,587",You first.
"01:27:30,477","01:27:31,307",You're hurt.
"01:27:31,637","01:27:32,672",I'll be all right.
"01:27:35,357","01:27:36,472",Dozer?
"01:27:53,997","01:27:56,272",Have you ever stood and stared at it?
"01:27:57,117","01:28:00,109",Marveled at its beauty...
"01:28:00,477","01:28:02,627",...its genius?
"01:28:03,757","01:28:05,554",Billions of people...
"01:28:05,797","01:28:08,436",...just living out their lives.
"01:28:09,437","01:28:11,029",Oblivious.
"01:28:15,437","01:28:18,190",Did you know that the first Matrix...
"01:28:18,437","01:28:22,953",...was designed to be a perfect human world where none suffered...
"01:28:23,397","01:28:26,195",...where everyone would be happy.
"01:28:26,717","01:28:28,150",It was a disaster.
"01:28:28,397","01:28:32,549",No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost.
"01:28:33,397","01:28:35,069",Some believe that...
"01:28:35,317","01:28:39,515",...we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world.
"01:28:39,757","01:28:41,236",But I believe that...
"01:28:41,637","01:28:42,513",...as a species...
"01:28:42,757","01:28:46,432",...human beings define their reality through misery...
"01:28:46,677","01:28:47,996",...and suffering.
"01:28:48,237","01:28:50,831",So the perfect world was a dream...
"01:28:51,077","01:28:55,707",...that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from.
"01:28:56,997","01:29:00,512",Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this.
"01:29:00,957","01:29:02,390",The peak...
"01:29:02,637","01:29:03,990",...of your civilization.
"01:29:04,237","01:29:06,387","I say, ""your civilization""..."
"01:29:06,637","01:29:10,596","...because when we started thinking for you, it became our civilization..."
"01:29:10,837","01:29:13,795","...which is, of course, what this is all about."
"01:29:15,077","01:29:17,545","Evolution, Morpheus."
"01:29:17,837","01:29:19,111",Evolution.
"01:29:21,317","01:29:23,114",Like the dinosaur.
"01:29:25,197","01:29:26,755",Look out that window.
"01:29:27,437","01:29:29,473",You had your time.
"01:29:30,157","01:29:33,911","The future is our world, Morpheus."
"01:29:34,237","01:29:36,512",The future is our time.
"01:29:40,597","01:29:41,666",There could be a problem.
"01:29:42,597","01:29:45,828",- What are they doing to him? - They're breaking into his mind.
"01:29:46,077","01:29:48,147",It's like hacking a computer. All it takes is time.
"01:29:48,397","01:29:49,546",How much time?
"01:29:49,797","01:29:52,789","Depends on the mind. But eventually, it'll crack..."
"01:29:53,037","01:29:57,269",...and his alpha patterns will change from this to this.
"01:29:57,517","01:30:00,350","When it does, he'll tell them anything they want to know."
"01:30:00,597","01:30:01,586",What do they want?
"01:30:01,837","01:30:05,716",The leader of every ship is given codes to Zion's mainframe computer.
"01:30:05,957","01:30:08,755",If an agent got the codes and got into Zion's mainframe...
"01:30:08,997","01:30:11,955",...they could destroy us. We can't let that happen.
"01:30:12,757","01:30:14,270",Zion's more important than me...
"01:30:14,517","01:30:15,393",...or you...
"01:30:15,717","01:30:16,945",...or even Morpheus.
"01:30:20,597","01:30:22,189",There has to be something we can do.
"01:30:22,597","01:30:24,508",There is. We pull the plug.
"01:30:27,477","01:30:29,149",You're going to kill him?
"01:30:29,397","01:30:30,512",Kill Morpheus?
"01:30:31,117","01:30:32,675",We don't have a choice.
"01:30:39,197","01:30:41,995",Never send a human to do a machine's job.
"01:30:42,237","01:30:43,909",If the insider has failed...
"01:30:44,157","01:30:47,229","...they'll sever the connection as soon as possible, unless..."
"01:30:47,477","01:30:49,115",They're dead. In either case...
"01:30:49,357","01:30:52,747",We have no choice. Continue as planned. Deploy the sentinels.
"01:30:52,997","01:30:54,032",Immediately.
"01:30:59,077","01:31:01,637","Morpheus, you were more than a leader to us."
"01:31:02,557","01:31:04,673",You were a father.
"01:31:06,157","01:31:08,034",We'll miss you always.
"01:31:14,837","01:31:15,792",Stop!
"01:31:16,957","01:31:18,106",I don't believe this is happening.
"01:31:18,357","01:31:20,313","- Neo, this has to be done. - Does it?"
"01:31:21,077","01:31:22,396",I don't know.
"01:31:22,717","01:31:24,196",This can't be just coincidence.
"01:31:24,397","01:31:25,193",What?
"01:31:25,677","01:31:26,473",The Oracle.
"01:31:26,717","01:31:28,435",She told me this would happen.
"01:31:28,837","01:31:32,830",She told me that I would have to make a choice.
"01:31:33,277","01:31:34,471",What choice?
"01:31:37,317","01:31:38,147",What are you doing?
"01:31:38,557","01:31:39,706",I'm going in.
"01:31:40,037","01:31:41,231","No, you're not."
"01:31:41,477","01:31:42,273",I have to.
"01:31:42,477","01:31:45,947","Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself so that we could get you out."
"01:31:46,197","01:31:48,028",There is no way that you're going back in.
"01:31:48,597","01:31:51,714",Morpheus did what he did because he believed I'm something I'm not.
"01:31:54,837","01:31:56,395","I'm not the One, Trinity."
"01:31:56,757","01:31:59,590","- The Oracle hit me with that too. - No, you have to be."
"01:31:59,837","01:32:02,397","I'm sorry, I'm not. I'm just another guy."
"01:32:03,037","01:32:04,231","No, Neo, that's not true."
"01:32:04,797","01:32:06,071",It can't be true.
"01:32:06,397","01:32:07,307",Why?
"01:32:11,557","01:32:14,754",This is loco. They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.
"01:32:14,997","01:32:19,195","Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him. Three of them."
"01:32:20,437","01:32:24,191","I want Morpheus back too, but what you're talking about is suicide."
"01:32:24,437","01:32:25,995",That's what it looks like...
"01:32:26,237","01:32:27,113",...but it's not.
"01:32:27,357","01:32:29,632",I can't explain to you why it's not.
"01:32:30,677","01:32:34,226","Morpheus believed something, and he was ready to give his life for it."
"01:32:34,477","01:32:37,355",I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
"01:32:37,597","01:32:38,393",Why?
"01:32:38,637","01:32:40,036",Because I believe in something.
"01:32:40,237","01:32:41,033",What?
"01:32:42,437","01:32:44,075",I believe I can bring him back.
"01:33:00,357","01:33:02,188",- What are you doing? - Going with you.
"01:33:02,477","01:33:03,307","No, you're not."
"01:33:03,557","01:33:04,387","""No""?"
"01:33:05,517","01:33:07,553",Let me tell you what I believe.
"01:33:08,037","01:33:10,312",Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.
"01:33:10,637","01:33:14,755","I believe if you are serious about saving him, you will need my help."
"01:33:14,997","01:33:16,953",And since I am the ranking officer...
"01:33:17,197","01:33:19,950","...if you don't like it, I believe you can go to hell."
"01:33:20,677","01:33:22,986",Because you aren't going anywhere else.
"01:33:23,397","01:33:24,193",Tank...
"01:33:25,037","01:33:26,152",...Ioad us up.
"01:33:35,357","01:33:38,508",I'd like to share a revelation that I've had...
"01:33:38,917","01:33:40,396",...during my time here.
"01:33:40,637","01:33:44,471",It came to me when I tried to classify your species...
"01:33:44,717","01:33:46,867",...and I realized...
"01:33:47,117","01:33:49,312",...that you're not actually mammals.
"01:33:51,437","01:33:53,792",Every mammal on this planet...
"01:33:54,117","01:33:58,827",...instinctively develops an equilibrium with the surrounding environment.
"01:33:59,077","01:34:00,829",But you humans do not.
"01:34:01,357","01:34:04,747",You move to an area and you multiply...
"01:34:04,997","01:34:09,309",...and multiply until every natural resource is consumed.
"01:34:09,637","01:34:11,628",The only way you can survive...
"01:34:11,917","01:34:14,750",...is to spread to another area.
"01:34:19,957","01:34:22,710",There is another organism on this planet...
"01:34:22,957","01:34:24,834",...that follows the same pattern.
"01:34:25,437","01:34:27,029",Do you know what it is?
"01:34:27,397","01:34:29,149",A virus.
"01:34:30,437","01:34:33,349",Human beings are a disease.
"01:34:33,717","01:34:35,196",A cancer of this planet.
"01:34:35,437","01:34:37,473",You are a plague.
"01:34:37,997","01:34:38,952",And we...
"01:34:39,517","01:34:40,836",...are the cure.
"01:34:41,797","01:34:43,150","Okay, so what do you need?"
"01:34:43,757","01:34:44,826",Besides a miracle.
"01:34:45,397","01:34:46,546",Guns.
"01:34:47,557","01:34:48,512",Lots of guns.
"01:35:00,837","01:35:03,271",No one has ever done anything like this.
"01:35:04,437","01:35:06,268",That's why it's going to work.
"01:35:10,197","01:35:12,074",Why isn't the serum working?
"01:35:12,637","01:35:14,832",Perhaps we're asking the wrong questions.
"01:35:16,837","01:35:18,031",Leave me with him.
"01:35:20,517","01:35:21,586",Now.
"01:35:32,357","01:35:33,870","Hold on, Morpheus."
"01:35:34,117","01:35:36,711",They're coming for you. They're coming.
"01:35:38,997","01:35:41,033","Can you hear me, Morpheus?"
"01:35:41,277","01:35:43,837",I'm going to be honest...
"01:35:44,197","01:35:45,346",...with you.
"01:35:49,557","01:35:50,910",I...
"01:35:51,957","01:35:52,833",...hate...
"01:35:53,077","01:35:54,954",...this place...
"01:35:55,277","01:35:57,472",...this zoo...
"01:35:57,717","01:35:58,786",...this prison...
"01:35:59,037","01:36:02,074","...this reality, whatever you want to call it."
"01:36:02,317","01:36:04,512",I can't stand it any longer.
"01:36:05,237","01:36:07,034",It's the smell.
"01:36:08,357","01:36:10,154",If there is such a thing.
"01:36:10,477","01:36:13,628",I feel saturated by it.
"01:36:15,077","01:36:16,305",I can...
"01:36:16,557","01:36:17,387",...taste...
"01:36:18,197","01:36:20,153",...your stink.
"01:36:20,397","01:36:23,992","And every time I do, I fear that I have somehow been infected by it."
"01:36:24,237","01:36:25,033",It's repulsive.
"01:36:25,957","01:36:27,276",Isn't it?
"01:36:29,357","01:36:31,552",I must get out of here.
"01:36:31,957","01:36:34,073",I must get free.
"01:36:34,317","01:36:37,070",And in this mind is the key.
"01:36:37,317","01:36:38,909",My key.
"01:36:39,157","01:36:41,910","Once Zion is destroyed, there is no need for me to be here."
"01:36:42,157","01:36:43,715",Do you understand?
"01:36:43,997","01:36:45,316",I need the codes.
"01:36:45,557","01:36:47,787",I have to get inside Zion...
"01:36:48,117","01:36:50,506",...and you have to tell me how.
"01:36:50,917","01:36:52,714",You're going to tell me...
"01:36:52,957","01:36:55,027",...or you're going to die.
"01:37:14,397","01:37:16,074","Please remove any metallic items you're carrying. Keys, loose change."
"01:37:16,074","01:37:17,393","Please remove any metallic items you're carrying. Keys, loose change."
"01:37:21,153","01:37:22,142",Holy shit!
"01:37:33,750","01:37:34,580",Backup.
"01:37:34,830","01:37:36,343",Send backup.
"01:37:59,390","01:38:00,266",Freeze!
"01:40:09,790","01:40:10,745",What were you doing?
"01:40:12,510","01:40:13,738",He doesn't know.
"01:40:13,990","01:40:15,423",Know what?
"01:40:42,350","01:40:44,739",I think they're trying to save him.
"01:40:58,990","01:41:00,662",There is no spoon.
"01:41:29,070","01:41:31,140",Find them and destroy them!
"01:41:32,710","01:41:33,620",We're under attack!
"01:42:07,105","01:42:07,901",Help!
"01:42:29,025","01:42:30,174",Only human.
"01:42:31,225","01:42:32,135",Dodge this.
"01:42:44,825","01:42:46,304",- How did you do that? - Do what?
"01:42:46,665","01:42:50,419",You moved like they do. I've never seen anyone move that fast.
"01:42:51,505","01:42:52,824",It wasn't fast enough.
"01:42:55,465","01:42:56,693",Can you fly that thing?
"01:42:57,985","01:42:58,781",Not yet.
"01:43:02,105","01:43:02,901",Operator.
"01:43:03,105","01:43:06,142",<i>I need a pilot program for a B-212 helicopter.</i>
"01:43:06,585","01:43:07,813",<i>Hurry.</i>
"01:43:15,425","01:43:16,983",Let's go.
"01:43:31,465","01:43:32,500",No.
"01:44:21,985","01:44:23,464","Morpheus, get up."
"01:44:23,705","01:44:24,501","Get up, get up."
"01:45:00,985","01:45:01,974",He's not going to make it.
"01:45:11,385","01:45:12,374",Got you.
"01:46:56,819","01:46:58,172",I knew it.
"01:46:58,979","01:46:59,934",He's the One.
"01:47:15,259","01:47:17,375","Do you believe it now, Trinity?"
"01:47:23,059","01:47:23,889",The Oracle.
"01:47:25,099","01:47:27,374",- She told me... - She told you...
"01:47:27,739","01:47:29,252",...what you needed to hear.
"01:47:29,539","01:47:30,813",That's all.
"01:47:31,819","01:47:34,652","Sooner or later you'll realize, just as I did..."
"01:47:34,979","01:47:37,174",...there's a difference between knowing the path...
"01:47:37,899","01:47:39,127",...and walking the path.
"01:47:42,059","01:47:43,208",Operator.
"01:47:44,099","01:47:46,533",<i>- It's good to hear your voice. - We need an exit.</i>
"01:47:46,779","01:47:49,452","Got one ready. Subway station, State and Balboa."
"01:48:01,979","01:48:02,889",Damn it!
"01:48:03,139","01:48:04,288",The trace was completed.
"01:48:04,539","01:48:05,415",We have their position.
"01:48:05,819","01:48:07,969",Sentinels are standing by.
"01:48:09,619","01:48:11,052",Order the strike.
"01:48:17,339","01:48:18,408",They're not out yet.
"01:48:29,979","01:48:31,253","You first, Morpheus."
"01:48:51,099","01:48:53,294","Neo, I want to tell you something..."
"01:48:56,419","01:49:00,207",...but I'm afraid of what it could mean if I do.
"01:49:03,659","01:49:06,810",Everything the Oracle told me has come true.
"01:49:09,459","01:49:10,938",Everything but this.
"01:49:12,579","01:49:13,375",But what?
"01:49:38,619","01:49:40,177",- What happened? - An agent.
"01:49:40,419","01:49:41,215",Send me back.
"01:49:41,459","01:49:42,289",I can't.
"01:49:44,219","01:49:46,130",Mr. Anderson.
"01:49:48,219","01:49:49,538","Run, Neo. Run."
"01:49:54,619","01:49:56,177",What is he doing?
"01:49:56,419","01:49:57,613",He's beginning to believe.
"01:50:23,496","01:50:24,214",You're empty.
"01:50:24,214","01:50:24,805",You're empty.
"01:50:25,374","01:50:26,602",So are you.
"01:50:58,414","01:51:01,292",I'm going to enjoy watching you die...
"01:51:02,374","01:51:03,363",...Mr. Anderson.
"01:51:42,654","01:51:44,645","Jesus, he's killing him."
"01:53:07,294","01:53:09,330","You hear that, Mr. Anderson?"
"01:53:10,054","01:53:12,932",That is the sound of inevitability.
"01:53:15,414","01:53:18,611",It is the sound of your death.
"01:53:19,494","01:53:21,724","Goodbye, Mr. Anderson."
"01:53:21,974","01:53:23,532",My name...
"01:53:26,414","01:53:28,370",...is Neo.
"01:53:59,294","01:54:01,330",- What happened? - I don't know. I lost him.
"01:54:03,814","01:54:04,803","Oh, shit."
"01:54:16,694","01:54:18,093",Sentinels.
"01:54:18,814","01:54:20,964","- How long? - Five, maybe six minutes."
"01:54:22,934","01:54:25,004","Tank, charge the EMP."
"01:54:25,254","01:54:28,166",- We can't use that until he's out. - I know. Don't worry.
"01:54:29,494","01:54:30,324",He's gonna make it.
"01:54:30,574","01:54:32,371","Flat or pumps? No, just..."
"01:54:32,614","01:54:35,367",What the shit? That's my phone!
"01:54:35,774","01:54:37,287",That guy took my phone!
"01:54:39,574","01:54:40,370",Got him!
"01:54:40,614","01:54:41,763",He's on the run.
"01:54:42,014","01:54:42,810",<i>Mr. Wizard...</i>
"01:54:43,254","01:54:44,573",...get me out of here!

"01:58:57,774","01:58:58,968",The Oracle told me...
"01:59:01,054","01:59:04,410","...I'd fall in love, and that the man I loved would be the One."
"01:59:07,414","01:59:09,291",So you see...
"01:59:09,974","01:59:11,885",...you can't be dead.
"01:59:13,414","01:59:15,166",You can't be...
"01:59:16,654","01:59:18,724",...because I love you.

"02:03:16,894","02:03:20,443",<i>A world where anything is possible.</i>
"02:03:22,974","02:03:24,248",<i>Where we go from there...</i>
