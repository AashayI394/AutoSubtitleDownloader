tt4912910,"00:16:06,857","00:16:08,607",The attacks didn't happen?
tt4912910,"00:16:08,953","00:16:12,205",The car accident you were in - that was an hour ago.
tt4912910,"00:16:12,572","00:16:14,787",I was driving the other car.

tt4912910,"00:17:34,206","00:17:37,627",That phone you unlocked lead us to a server in Iceland but we managed
tt4912910,"00:17:37,628","00:17:41,211",to decrypt the communicate between John Lark and this woman:
tt4912910,"00:17:41,354","00:17:43,711","Alanna Mitsopolis, activist and philanthropist whose"
tt4912910,"00:17:43,712","00:17:46,284",charity work has earned her the nickname the White Widow.
tt4912910,"00:17:46,285","00:17:49,706","It's all a front for her real trade: arms dealing, money laundering."
tt4912910,"00:17:49,707","00:17:52,894",Extensive political connections provide her with protection.
tt4912910,"00:17:52,895","00:17:55,071",Lark and the Widow were meeting tonight to
tt4912910,"00:17:55,072","00:17:57,493",negotiate the delivery of unspecified package.
tt4912910,"00:17:57,494","00:18:00,406",Which we can only assume is our missing plutonium.
tt4912910,"00:18:00,407","00:18:03,215",They'll make contact in the private lounge at the <i>Grand Palais</i> in Paris.
tt4912910,"00:18:03,216","00:18:06,247",During her annual fund-raising event. The details are in the file.
tt4912910,"00:18:06,248","00:18:09,498",If Lark isn't there by midnight the Widow will leave.
tt4912910,"00:18:09,698","00:18:13,154",And sell the package to the highest bidder. Which gives you...
tt4912910,"00:18:13,155","00:18:15,352",...two hours from now to find Lark.
tt4912910,"00:18:15,353","00:18:17,691","Sir, I think there’s something you need to know."
tt4912910,"00:18:17,692","00:18:22,076",I'm gonna stop you right there. You had a terrible choice to make in Berlin.
tt4912910,"00:18:22,077","00:18:24,301",Recover the plutonium or save your team.
tt4912910,"00:18:24,302","00:18:27,052",You chose your team and now the world's at risk.
tt4912910,"00:18:27,053","00:18:29,872","Some flaw, deep within your core being simply won't"
tt4912910,"00:18:29,873","00:18:32,900",allow you to choose between one life and millions.
tt4912910,"00:18:33,446","00:18:37,693","You see that as a sign of weakness. To me, that's your greatest strength."
tt4912910,"00:18:37,694","00:18:40,702",It also tells me I can count on you to cover my ass.
tt4912910,"00:18:40,703","00:18:43,783",Because coming here from <i>CIA</i> was a lateral move. Some say a step down.
tt4912910,"00:18:43,784","00:18:46,994",But I did it because of you.
tt4912910,"00:18:47,924","00:18:49,563",Don't make me regret it.
tt4912910,"00:19:01,746","00:19:03,051",Make the call.
tt4912910,"00:19:06,592","00:19:07,897",Shut them down.
tt4912910,"00:19:18,959","00:19:20,043","What do you think you're doing, Erica?"
tt4912910,"00:19:20,044","00:19:23,688",It may be your mission but this is the <i>CIA</i>- s plane.
tt4912910,"00:19:23,727","00:19:26,400",It doesn't take off without my say-so. - We don't have time for this.
tt4912910,"00:19:26,401","00:19:30,083",I have a team in Paris ready to grab Lark as soon as he gets to <i>Palais</i>.
tt4912910,"00:19:31,084","00:19:35,408",A <i>G5</i> standing by to rendition him to <i>GITMO</i> where waterboard is waiting.
tt4912910,"00:19:35,409","00:19:38,412",Spend 24 hours we don’t have to pull a confession we can't
tt4912910,"00:19:38,413","00:19:41,440",trust from a man we haven't positively identified?
tt4912910,"00:19:41,497","00:19:45,071",No. We need reliable intelligence and we need it now.
tt4912910,"00:19:45,268","00:19:47,792",This scenario is precisely why the <i>IMF</i> exists!
tt4912910,"00:19:47,793","00:19:53,231","The <i>IMF</i> is <i>Halloween</i>, Alan. Bunch of grown men in rubber masks playing <i>Trick or treat</i>."
tt4912910,"00:19:54,068","00:19:56,339",And if had held on to the plutonium in Berlin
tt4912910,"00:19:56,340","00:19:58,812",we wouldn't be having this conversation.
tt4912910,"00:19:58,924","00:20:02,026","And his team would be dead. - Yes, they would."
tt4912910,"00:20:02,248","00:20:05,390",That's the job. And that's why I want one of my
tt4912910,"00:20:05,391","00:20:08,877",own men on the scene. To appraise the situation.
tt4912910,"00:20:09,684","00:20:11,775","Agent Walker, <i>Special Activities</i>."
tt4912910,"00:20:12,104","00:20:14,668",His reputation precedes.
tt4912910,"00:20:14,669","00:20:16,086",You use the scalpel.
tt4912910,"00:20:17,025","00:20:18,330",I prefer a hammer.
tt4912910,"00:20:19,123","00:20:21,777",The answer is <i>No</i>. I have operational authority here.
tt4912910,"00:20:21,778","00:20:24,526","Direct from the President. You have a problem with that, you take it up with him."
tt4912910,"00:20:24,527","00:20:27,555",I have already and he agrees with me. My man goes.
tt4912910,"00:20:27,862","00:20:30,155",Or no one goes.
tt4912910,"00:20:37,901","00:20:40,242",No one comes between you and that plutonium.
tt4912910,"00:20:40,243","00:20:43,450","Not Hunt, not his team, not anyone."
tt4912910,"00:21:02,222","00:21:04,867",The White Widow has spies in every level of government.
tt4912910,"00:21:04,868","00:21:09,673",This plain is posing as commercial airliner so we can jump into France undetected.
tt4912910,"00:21:09,852","00:21:12,718",Widow’s meeting Lark in a <i>VIP</i> lounge at midnight.
tt4912910,"00:21:12,719","00:21:16,256",No one can be a bidder without a pre-issued electronic <i>ID</i> band.
tt4912910,"00:21:16,257","00:21:20,725",We've acquired the unique <i>RFID</i> number for Larks band allowing us to locate it...
tt4912910,"00:21:20,726","00:21:24,988","...with these. Find that <i>ID</i> band, you'll find Lark."
tt4912910,"00:21:25,672","00:21:26,977",Then what?
tt4912910,"00:21:28,952","00:21:30,257",Then...
tt4912910,"00:21:31,633","00:21:36,384",I assume his identity. Make contact with the Widow. She takes us to the package.
tt4912910,"00:21:37,602","00:21:39,796",People actually fall for this shit?
tt4912910,"00:21:40,993","00:21:43,521",How do you intend to make Lark cooperate?
tt4912910,"00:21:45,380","00:21:47,451",I bump him in the crowd.
tt4912910,"00:21:47,801","00:21:50,075",In 10 seconds he'll look like any other drunk at the party.
tt4912910,"00:21:50,076","00:21:52,496","Incoherent, completely pliable."
tt4912910,"00:21:52,497","00:21:54,821",After I borrow his face you walk him out the front door
tt4912910,"00:21:54,822","00:21:56,894",and hand him over to Sloans extraction team.
tt4912910,"00:21:56,895","00:22:00,270","You're not getting rid of me that easily, Hunt. - That's not what this is about."
tt4912910,"00:22:00,271","00:22:02,443",Sure it is.
tt4912910,"00:22:02,558","00:22:05,030",I know you don't want me on this detail.
tt4912910,"00:22:05,108","00:22:06,479",But let's face it.
tt4912910,"00:22:06,753","00:22:10,388",If you made the hard choice in Berlin I wouldn't be here.
tt4912910,"00:22:10,606","00:22:14,051",If you hadn't gun down your <i>Syndicate</i> agent they sent you to find
tt4912910,"00:22:14,052","00:22:15,581",I wouldn't be here.
tt4912910,"00:22:16,372","00:22:17,794",That's right. I know all about you.
tt4912910,"00:22:17,795","00:22:22,664",You're why we don't have living witness who can identify John Lark. Or the Apostles.
tt4912910,"00:22:22,665","00:22:26,659",If you have a problem with my methods you can always stay behind.
tt4912910,"00:22:27,191","00:22:32,352","Your mission, should you choose to accept it. Isn't that the thing?"
tt4912910,"00:22:34,449","00:22:36,456",<i>Two minutes to decompression.</i>
tt4912910,"00:22:36,516","00:22:37,803",Suite up!

tt4912910,"00:22:56,699","00:22:58,666",<i>10 seconds to decompression.</i>
tt4912910,"00:23:02,101","00:23:03,792",Is your oxygen on?
tt4912910,"00:23:05,625","00:23:10,097",There's no atmosphere at this altitude. I don't need you blacking out on me.
tt4912910,"00:23:12,580","00:23:16,150","Hey, your heads up display has built-in guidance system. Follow it to the target."
tt4912910,"00:23:16,151","00:23:20,345","Open your shoot when the system says. Not before, definitely not after."
tt4912910,"00:23:20,392","00:23:23,763",Or the last thing that goes trough your mind will be your kneecaps. Is that clear?
tt4912910,"00:23:23,764","00:23:25,069",Crystal.
tt4912910,"00:23:47,539","00:23:49,709",We gotta talk. Need to rethink this.
tt4912910,"00:23:49,710","00:23:53,713","Out of my way, Hunt! - Walker, we have a problem. There's a storm and we need to..."
tt4912910,"00:23:53,714","00:23:56,402",Enough talk. I'll see you in Paris!

tt4912910,"00:32:57,494","00:32:58,799",Shit.
tt4912910,"00:33:18,198","00:33:21,377",Can you still make a mask? - I need a face to make a mask.
tt4912910,"00:33:21,378","00:33:22,683",Sorry.
tt4912910,"00:33:22,797","00:33:24,602",I was aiming for his chest.
tt4912910,"00:33:26,551","00:33:28,458",What are you doing here? - It's good to see you too.
tt4912910,"00:33:28,459","00:33:30,800","Sorry, I'm confused. You're?"
tt4912910,"00:33:33,276","00:33:34,581",An old friend.
tt4912910,"00:33:47,566","00:33:50,062",Cancel extraction. We're code Blue.
tt4912910,"00:33:50,320","00:33:52,577",Send sanitation.
tt4912910,"00:33:52,939","00:33:54,920",That was my team.
tt4912910,"00:33:56,593","00:33:59,898",You didn't answer my question. What are you doing here?
tt4912910,"00:34:02,216","00:34:04,220",That's it. Just take it easy. That's it.
tt4912910,"00:34:04,221","00:34:06,199",Just keep your head back until the bleeding stops.
tt4912910,"00:34:06,200","00:34:09,794",What is it?! <i>You want some?!</i>
tt4912910,"00:34:11,540","00:34:14,093",You're not here by accident. Who sent you?
tt4912910,"00:34:14,094","00:34:16,288",I can't tell you that. - What are you doing?
tt4912910,"00:34:16,289","00:34:19,049",I have a date with White Widow. - He had a date with the Widow.
tt4912910,"00:34:19,050","00:34:22,859","You look nothing like him. - Now, we have to hope they never met."
tt4912910,"00:34:22,860","00:34:25,810",Hope is not a strategy! - You must be new.
tt4912910,"00:34:26,180","00:34:28,972",I have no other choice. White Widow is our only lead.
tt4912910,"00:34:28,973","00:34:31,162",I got to be this guy for 5 minutes. - Don't do it.
tt4912910,"00:34:31,163","00:34:34,239",What? What is it?
tt4912910,"00:34:34,561","00:34:36,933",What aren't you telling me? - You don't understand what you're involved in.
tt4912910,"00:34:36,934","00:34:41,739",I don't understand what I'm involved in? I don't understand what I'm involved in?!
tt4912910,"00:34:43,935","00:34:48,463",What am I involved in? - If you're meeting the Widow she leaves in 3 minutes.
tt4912910,"00:34:49,935","00:34:51,424",Ethan! - I'll make it work.
tt4912910,"00:34:51,425","00:34:53,797",Ethan! - I'll make it work!
tt4912910,"00:34:55,951","00:34:59,433",Name's Walker. - Yeah? You're welcome.
tt4912910,"00:35:18,842","00:35:20,837",What do you think you're doing? - I'm going with you.
tt4912910,"00:35:20,838","00:35:22,955",Like hell you are! - People have been sent here to kill Lark.
tt4912910,"00:35:22,956","00:35:26,075","No shit. - No, not me, contractors. Paid assassins."
tt4912910,"00:35:26,296","00:35:27,540",They don't know what he looks like.
tt4912910,"00:35:27,541","00:35:29,215",They only know he's meeting the Widow at midnight.
tt4912910,"00:35:29,216","00:35:31,363",If you go trough with this they're gonna believe you're Lark
tt4912910,"00:35:31,364","00:35:33,095",and they're gonna kill you.
tt4912910,"00:35:33,096","00:35:35,023",How do you know all of this?
tt4912910,"00:35:36,154","00:35:37,710",I can't tell you that.
tt4912910,"00:35:40,226","00:35:42,531",You should've stayed out of the game.
tt4912910,"00:35:44,338","00:35:46,451",You should've come with me.
tt4912910,"00:35:54,815","00:35:58,044",This charity was started in honor of my mother.
tt4912910,"00:35:59,118","00:36:01,767",Those of you who knew her understood her strength.
tt4912910,"00:36:01,768","00:36:04,953",Her tenacity. Her resourcefulness.
tt4912910,"00:36:06,146","00:36:08,533",But there was another side to her.
tt4912910,"00:36:08,966","00:36:11,249",The side most people never saw.
tt4912910,"00:36:11,484","00:36:16,234",It's that part of her spirit that has brought us all together tonight.
tt4912910,"00:36:17,292","00:36:20,175",Max was something of a paradox.
tt4912910,"00:36:22,568","00:36:25,615",She had a fascination for paradoxes.
tt4912910,"00:36:25,908","00:36:28,734",A fascination she passed onto me.
tt4912910,"00:36:30,664","00:36:34,784",Max had no illusions about the world we live in today.
tt4912910,"00:36:35,384","00:36:38,817",But she had dreams of a very different future.
tt4912910,"00:36:39,528","00:36:43,240",One in which her unique talents were no longer required.
tt4912910,"00:36:43,857","00:36:46,500",All she earned from the way the world is
tt4912910,"00:36:46,501","00:36:50,045",went ultimately to making it what it could someday be.
tt4912910,"00:36:51,013","00:36:53,570",That future isn't here yet.
tt4912910,"00:36:54,763","00:36:59,587",Tonight your contributions have brought it just a little closer.
tt4912910,"00:37:03,074","00:37:06,518",Go with the opportunity. Enjoy the party.
tt4912910,"00:37:26,787","00:37:30,015",You can't possibly be John Lark?
tt4912910,"00:37:33,514","00:37:35,655","I'm not, actually."
tt4912910,"00:37:36,485","00:37:38,812",It's an alias.
tt4912910,"00:37:40,462","00:37:43,801",I suppose it's better than John Doe. Is there another name you prefer?
tt4912910,"00:37:43,802","00:37:48,078",Is there somewhere we can talk privately? - I like Lark. It has a certain ring.
tt4912910,"00:37:48,079","00:37:50,803",We don't have a lot of time. - I'll be honest with you.
tt4912910,"00:37:50,804","00:37:53,869",A man with your reputation. I was expecting someone...
tt4912910,"00:37:53,870","00:37:56,168",...uglier.
tt4912910,"00:37:56,389","00:37:59,893",Don't let looks deceive because I'm as ugly as they come. Now I'll be honest with you.
tt4912910,"00:37:59,894","00:38:02,406",Your life's in danger.
tt4912910,"00:38:03,111","00:38:06,464","Don't you touch her. - Relax, he's my brother."
tt4912910,"00:38:07,363","00:38:09,670","You're being rude to our guest, Zola."
tt4912910,"00:38:09,671","00:38:10,976",It's time to go.
tt4912910,"00:38:11,327","00:38:13,319",Don't turn this into a scene.
tt4912910,"00:38:15,321","00:38:17,236",You don't leave this room.
tt4912910,"00:38:23,608","00:38:26,241",You see? - Your life's in danger.
tt4912910,"00:38:27,033","00:38:30,338",And who'd want to kill me? - The Americans for starters.
tt4912910,"00:38:30,494","00:38:34,744",Duly noted. - You think you're the only one with spies in the government?
tt4912910,"00:38:34,852","00:38:38,056",There are people here who don't want this meeting to happen.
tt4912910,"00:38:38,057","00:38:39,898",Don't believe me?
tt4912910,"00:38:40,134","00:38:41,835",Look around.
tt4912910,"00:38:53,684","00:38:55,551",I know what you're thinking.
tt4912910,"00:38:55,904","00:38:59,654",Maybe they're not here for you. Maybe they're just here for me.
tt4912910,"00:38:59,868","00:39:02,216",Are you willing to take that chance?
tt4912910,"00:39:02,810","00:39:04,966",You have something I want.
tt4912910,"00:39:05,063","00:39:09,687",Right now that makes me the only person you can trust to get you out of here alive.
tt4912910,"00:39:09,688","00:39:12,549",Or would you rather leave that to your brother?
tt4912910,"00:39:16,592","00:39:19,742","I think I'd like to go home now, Mr. Lark."
tt4912910,"00:41:35,140","00:41:38,084",The French government will receive the asset they took in today.
tt4912910,"00:41:38,085","00:41:41,981",Delivery will be by air to the finance ministry at 8:00 AM tomorrow morning.
tt4912910,"00:41:41,982","00:41:46,038",Another motorcade under heavy police escort will transport him on along this root.
tt4912910,"00:41:46,039","00:41:49,687",We'll create a diversion at this intersection. Here.
tt4912910,"00:41:49,688","00:41:53,882","Motorcade will automatically take the pre-planned alternate root, here."
tt4912910,"00:41:53,906","00:41:55,878",Where we'll extract the asset.
tt4912910,"00:41:56,803","00:41:59,236",Extract the asset?
tt4912910,"00:42:10,203","00:42:11,508",The asset?
tt4912910,"00:42:13,694","00:42:16,317",We've payed a great deal of money for this information.
tt4912910,"00:42:16,318","00:42:18,957",They gave us everything but this mans name.
tt4912910,"00:42:19,433","00:42:22,072","You don't happen to know who he is, do you?"
tt4912910,"00:42:22,802","00:42:26,663",His name is Solomon Lane. British special agent turned anarchist.
tt4912910,"00:42:28,388","00:42:33,082",He used rogue covert operatives to create a terror network called the Syndicate.
tt4912910,"00:42:34,035","00:42:37,012","Sabotage, assassination, mass murder..."
tt4912910,"00:42:37,316","00:42:39,649",Ugly as they come.
tt4912910,"00:42:39,994","00:42:42,974",He was captured by American agents two years ago.
tt4912910,"00:42:43,454","00:42:46,622",Since then he's been under never-ending interrogation.
tt4912910,"00:42:46,623","00:42:49,438",Passed around from one government to another.
tt4912910,"00:42:50,230","00:42:52,430",To answer for his crimes.
tt4912910,"00:42:55,208","00:42:57,547","You seem displeased, Lark?"
tt4912910,"00:42:57,563","00:43:00,543",Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.
tt4912910,"00:43:01,133","00:43:03,892",I came to Paris for plutonium.
tt4912910,"00:43:03,893","00:43:06,417","Well, there must be a misunderstanding."
tt4912910,"00:43:06,534","00:43:10,582",I'm just a broker. I connect a buyer and a seller.
tt4912910,"00:43:11,019","00:43:14,991",My seller isn't interested in cash. So if you want the plutonium...
tt4912910,"00:43:15,739","00:43:19,368",Extract Lane and make a trade.
tt4912910,"00:43:20,203","00:43:21,508",That's right.
tt4912910,"00:43:26,196","00:43:28,779",How do I know the seller has what I want.
tt4912910,"00:43:47,683","00:43:49,544",A down-payment in good faith.
tt4912910,"00:43:50,447","00:43:53,745",The Currier we'll deliver two more within 48 hours.
tt4912910,"00:43:53,746","00:43:57,224",In exchange for him.
tt4912910,"00:44:04,894","00:44:06,199",All right.
tt4912910,"00:44:06,287","00:44:08,350",What happens after diversion?
tt4912910,"00:45:42,075","00:45:43,380",Kill everyone?
tt4912910,"00:45:43,920","00:45:45,225",That's your plan?
tt4912910,"00:45:45,467","00:45:47,494",There'll be no witnesses.
tt4912910,"00:45:47,749","00:45:50,739",What's my guarantee that Lane walks out of this thing alive?
tt4912910,"00:45:50,740","00:45:52,514",He's in an armored box.
tt4912910,"00:45:52,870","00:45:55,009",We'll pull him out when it's safe.
tt4912910,"00:45:55,431","00:45:57,374",You want your plutonium?
tt4912910,"00:45:57,401","00:45:59,307",This is the price.
tt4912910,"00:46:01,061","00:46:03,533",Or do you draw the line at killing cops?
tt4912910,"00:46:03,667","00:46:05,927",That's John Lark you're talking to.
tt4912910,"00:46:08,695","00:46:11,869",I've murdered women and children with smallpox.
tt4912910,"00:46:14,177","00:46:16,117",I have no line.
tt4912910,"00:46:20,267","00:46:21,572",Right.
tt4912910,"00:46:21,673","00:46:24,765","Sleep well, everyone. Busy day tomorrow."
tt4912910,"00:46:45,024","00:46:47,044",You have got to be kidding me?
tt4912910,"00:46:47,196","00:46:50,011",If you want Lane out of prison this is how he gets out.
tt4912910,"00:46:50,012","00:46:52,730","I wanted Lark to brake him out, not Ethan Hunt."
tt4912910,"00:46:52,731","00:46:56,925","I wanted Lark at the exchange, not Ethan Hunt."
tt4912910,"00:46:57,207","00:47:01,512",I wanted Lark to lead us to the plutonium and the Apostles.
tt4912910,"00:47:02,182","00:47:03,881",You may still get your chance.
tt4912910,"00:47:03,882","00:47:06,347",Have you forgotten about the corpse we pulled out of men's room
tt4912910,"00:47:06,348","00:47:09,085",at the <i>Grand Palais</i>? - I'm guessing that wasn't Lark.
tt4912910,"00:47:09,086","00:47:13,025",More likely one of Larks recruits. - Not according to our intelligence.
tt4912910,"00:47:13,026","00:47:14,998",Intelligence gathered by whom?
tt4912910,"00:47:17,275","00:47:18,580",Hunt.
tt4912910,"00:47:19,415","00:47:22,832",You long held suspicions that Lark was an American agent.
tt4912910,"00:47:22,863","00:47:27,335",Someone who knew our every move. Someone who could come and go like a ghost.
tt4912910,"00:47:28,305","00:47:31,343",You're suggesting Hunt is John Lark?
tt4912910,"00:47:32,054","00:47:36,171","You're reaching, Walker. Trying to save your ass."
tt4912910,"00:47:36,476","00:47:37,781",It won't work.
tt4912910,"00:47:38,132","00:47:43,197",Think about it. Would a man as careful as Lark really stick his neck out like that?
tt4912910,"00:47:43,392","00:47:45,975",For a face to face with the White Widow?
tt4912910,"00:47:46,005","00:47:48,630",He'd send a proxy. - A decoy.
tt4912910,"00:47:48,696","00:47:51,516",If he was really smart he'd had his lady friend
tt4912910,"00:47:51,517","00:47:54,617",kill that decoy in front of a reliable witness.
tt4912910,"00:47:55,134","00:47:56,439",Me.
tt4912910,"00:47:56,653","00:47:59,930",The dragnet is closing down on his terrorist alter-ego.
tt4912910,"00:47:59,931","00:48:03,992",So he pays a man to play the part of Lark and has him killed.
tt4912910,"00:48:04,548","00:48:06,846",And under the guise of serving his country...
tt4912910,"00:48:06,847","00:48:10,074",Assumes his own secret identity.
tt4912910,"00:48:10,092","00:48:14,175",Free to operate at will with the full support of US government. - Why?
tt4912910,"00:48:14,808","00:48:16,758",Why would Hunt turn?
tt4912910,"00:48:17,232","00:48:20,364",Why did Lane do it? Why did any of his Apostles?
tt4912910,"00:48:20,759","00:48:23,910",They were believers in a cause.
tt4912910,"00:48:24,281","00:48:28,809",And when that cause turned out to be a lie they turned against their masters.
tt4912910,"00:48:28,959","00:48:31,741","How many times has Hunts government betrayed him,"
tt4912910,"00:48:31,742","00:48:34,375","disavowed him, casted him aside?"
tt4912910,"00:48:34,508","00:48:38,676",And how long before a man like that has had enough?
tt4912910,"00:48:39,726","00:48:42,473",That is a serious accusation.
tt4912910,"00:48:44,068","00:48:45,605",Can you prove it?
tt4912910,"00:48:49,466","00:48:53,327",This is the phone we pulled of the dead body at the <i>Grand Palais</i>.
tt4912910,"00:48:58,053","00:49:00,692",I'm guessing it has all the proof you need.
tt4912910,"00:51:04,626","00:51:07,598",Is it true Lane gassed a village of 2000 people?
tt4912910,"00:51:09,902","00:51:10,902",Yes.
tt4912910,"00:51:10,903","00:51:15,208",Is it true he brought down an entire passenger plane just to kill one man?
tt4912910,"00:51:15,923","00:51:17,228",Yes.
tt4912910,"00:51:18,292","00:51:21,303","Is it true that he... - Walker, whatever you heard."
tt4912910,"00:51:21,304","00:51:24,477","If it makes your skin crawl, it's probably true."
tt4912910,"00:51:31,336","00:51:32,641",Holy shit!
tt4912910,"00:51:34,349","00:51:36,988","You're the guy that caught him, aren't you?"
tt4912910,"00:51:38,584","00:51:41,834",How long do you think he's gonna keep that to himself?
tt4912910,"00:51:45,269","00:51:47,797",We'll burn that bridge when we get to it.
tt4912910,"00:52:37,237","00:52:38,542",Close it.
tt4912910,"00:54:15,670","00:54:17,458",What the hell is he doing?
tt4912910,"00:55:48,568","00:55:50,791",<i>NO SIGNAL</i>
tt4912910,"00:56:30,673","00:56:33,145","Hunt, <i>where are you?</i> - Don't wait for me!"
tt4912910,"00:56:34,014","00:56:35,715",<i>Wanna do... What's wrong?</i>
tt4912910,"00:56:37,070","00:56:39,551",I'll meet you at the garage!
tt4912910,"00:56:48,046","00:56:49,718","Benji, do you copy?!"
tt4912910,"00:56:49,910","00:56:54,095",We copy. Go.<i> - Change of plan. I'm glued. Need extraction!</i>
tt4912910,"00:56:54,388","00:56:55,693",We're on our way!
tt4912910,"00:57:10,434","00:57:12,510",<i>He's driving from Notre Dame to the Saint</i>
tt4912910,"00:57:12,511","00:57:15,261",<i>Louis bridge. Police patrols are chasing him.</i>
tt4912910,"01:01:35,953","01:01:37,258",<i>STOP!</i>
tt4912910,"01:01:37,423","01:01:39,036",<i>Stay where you are!</i>
tt4912910,"01:01:41,384","01:01:42,689",Get in the car.
tt4912910,"01:01:43,278","01:01:44,583",<i>Nobody move!</i>
tt4912910,"01:01:47,835","01:01:49,196",<i>Show me your hands!</i>
tt4912910,"01:01:51,068","01:01:53,252","<i>Go away, please.</i>"
tt4912910,"01:01:53,340","01:01:55,237",<i>Show me your hands!</i>

tt4912910,"01:02:04,975","01:02:07,185","<i>Go away, please.</i>"
tt4912910,"01:02:13,044","01:02:15,181",Zola wants a word with you.
tt4912910,"01:02:19,040","01:02:21,543",<i>What do we do with her? - Kill her.</i>
tt4912910,"01:02:52,002","01:02:53,571",<i>You will be fine.</i>
tt4912910,"01:03:00,233","01:03:01,841",<i>You will be fine.</i>
tt4912910,"01:03:01,893","01:03:03,198",We gotta go!
tt4912910,"01:03:04,216","01:03:06,452",<i>I am so sorry.</i> - Come on!
tt4912910,"01:03:43,663","01:03:45,314",The name's Walker by the way.
tt4912910,"01:03:45,315","01:03:47,479",Was the little car your idea?
tt4912910,"01:03:57,666","01:03:58,971",Jesus Christ!
tt4912910,"01:03:59,732","01:04:01,936",What the hell was that?!
tt4912910,"01:04:07,540","01:04:09,622","Everybody, out! - Go, go, go!"
tt4912910,"01:06:47,173","01:06:48,478",That was Ilsa.
tt4912910,"01:06:48,770","01:06:50,075",Shut up!
tt4912910,"01:06:50,508","01:06:51,813",Very interesting.
tt4912910,"01:06:55,628","01:06:58,058","It's good to see you again, Ethan."
tt4912910,"01:07:35,573","01:07:37,717",Look who's still alive.
tt4912910,"01:07:41,472","01:07:44,944",There's a microwave tracker in his neck. - OK. You know what to do.
tt4912910,"01:07:44,945","01:07:48,472",Let me just assure you this won't hurt... enough.
tt4912910,"01:07:50,764","01:07:52,069",90 seconds.
tt4912910,"01:07:53,307","01:07:57,135",You and the Apostles think we're gonna trade you for the missing plutonium.
tt4912910,"01:07:57,136","01:07:59,784",I'm here to tell you that's never gonna happen.
tt4912910,"01:07:59,785","01:08:02,768","Your mission, should you choose to accept it..."
tt4912910,"01:08:04,150","01:08:07,656","I wander, Ethan, did you ever choose not to?"
tt4912910,"01:08:08,331","01:08:12,487",Did you ever stop and ask yourself who's giving you the orders or why?
tt4912910,"01:08:13,547","01:08:18,129",When everyday the master you serve is one step closer to ending the world.
tt4912910,"01:08:18,191","01:08:20,600",Strange accusation coming from a terrorist.
tt4912910,"01:08:20,601","01:08:23,495","60 seconds. - Terrorists are schoolboys, desperate for attention."
tt4912910,"01:08:23,496","01:08:26,776",Hoping to shape public opinion trough fear.
tt4912910,"01:08:27,496","01:08:30,699",I don't care in the least what people think or feel.
tt4912910,"01:08:31,085","01:08:33,910",In my experience they don't do either for very long.
tt4912910,"01:08:33,911","01:08:37,825",I suppose that justifies bombing factories or bringing down civilian aircraft.
tt4912910,"01:08:37,826","01:08:40,076",Or strapping me into explosive vest!
tt4912910,"01:08:40,253","01:08:43,561","Consider it unfinished business, my funny little friend."
tt4912910,"01:08:43,562","01:08:45,034",Luther? - Almost there.
tt4912910,"01:08:45,142","01:08:47,443","You see the end as clearly as I do, Ethan."
tt4912910,"01:08:47,444","01:08:50,615",Governments the world over are descending into madness.
tt4912910,"01:08:50,616","01:08:54,764",The Syndicate was created to tear them down. Brick by brick.
tt4912910,"01:08:54,765","01:08:56,646",The Syndicate was a pack of murdering cowards!
tt4912910,"01:08:56,647","01:08:59,599",The Syndicate was civilizations last hope!
tt4912910,"01:09:00,172","01:09:03,343",A chance to smash the old world order.
tt4912910,"01:09:04,137","01:09:08,859",That hope is gone now because of you and your pathetic morality.
tt4912910,"01:09:10,774","01:09:13,220","You should have killed me, Ethan."
tt4912910,"01:09:15,277","01:09:19,112","The end you always feared, it's coming."
tt4912910,"01:09:21,999","01:09:24,288",It's coming.
tt4912910,"01:09:24,915","01:09:27,834",And her blood will be on your hands.
tt4912910,"01:09:30,182","01:09:34,925",The fallout. For all your good intentions.
tt4912910,"01:09:41,681","01:09:43,944",Time! - Got it!
tt4912910,"01:10:08,526","01:10:09,831",Get him up!
tt4912910,"01:10:12,518","01:10:13,823",You're mine now!
tt4912910,"01:10:23,030","01:10:27,831","You're just full of surprises, Lark. - Your brothers plan was bad from the word <i>go</i>."
tt4912910,"01:10:27,832","01:10:31,804",You'd lost all your men and Lane would've been killed in crossfire.
tt4912910,"01:10:32,301","01:10:34,060",I had to improvise.
tt4912910,"01:10:34,753","01:10:37,003",Why not say that in the first place?
tt4912910,"01:10:37,302","01:10:41,052",Because I don't trust your people. Especially not your brother.
tt4912910,"01:10:45,049","01:10:46,354","Family,"
tt4912910,"01:10:46,499","01:10:48,418",what can you do?
tt4912910,"01:10:50,931","01:10:52,887",So where's Lane?
tt4912910,"01:10:53,146","01:10:55,671",Certainly not at the bottom of the Seine.
tt4912910,"01:10:55,672","01:10:57,642",I have him. He's safe.
tt4912910,"01:10:58,094","01:11:00,090",Where do I meet the Currier?
tt4912910,"01:11:01,500","01:11:03,462",Let's talk about the woman.
tt4912910,"01:11:05,132","01:11:06,437",Woman?
tt4912910,"01:11:06,468","01:11:09,567",She was with you at the <i>Palais</i>. Zola saw her again today.
tt4912910,"01:11:09,568","01:11:13,596",She tried to kill Lane. She had a chance to kill you but she didn't.
tt4912910,"01:11:13,974","01:11:15,279",Why?
tt4912910,"01:11:18,730","01:11:20,577",We have a past.
tt4912910,"01:11:21,612","01:11:22,917",It's complicated.
tt4912910,"01:11:24,922","01:11:27,616","Well, I'll make it more complicated for you."
tt4912910,"01:11:27,799","01:11:29,610",My price just went up.
tt4912910,"01:11:30,059","01:11:33,476",Someone killed four of my men today. I assume it was her.
tt4912910,"01:11:40,279","01:11:42,074","I want her, Lark."
tt4912910,"01:11:42,813","01:11:44,896",And you're gonna bring her to me.
tt4912910,"01:11:45,834","01:11:50,639",Otherwise you don't meet the Currier and the plutonium goes to the highest bidder.
tt4912910,"01:11:51,171","01:11:53,616",I'd hate for her to come between us.
tt4912910,"01:11:57,937","01:11:59,242",She's yours.
tt4912910,"01:12:00,224","01:12:02,711",At the meeting. Not before.
tt4912910,"01:12:14,927","01:12:16,596",Go to London.
tt4912910,"01:12:17,255","01:12:19,241",Instructions will follow.
tt4912910,"01:14:00,890","01:14:03,684",I knew if I followed her you'd show up eventually.
tt4912910,"01:14:03,685","01:14:04,990",You OK?
tt4912910,"01:14:07,786","01:14:10,703","Ilsa, I'd never... - I know you had your reasons."
tt4912910,"01:14:11,727","01:14:13,032",I know.
tt4912910,"01:14:16,963","01:14:19,841",You need to walk away. - I can't do that.
tt4912910,"01:14:21,483","01:14:23,900",You weren't at the <i>Palais</i> to kill Lark.
tt4912910,"01:14:24,050","01:14:25,355",No.
tt4912910,"01:14:27,082","01:14:29,054",You were there to protect him.
tt4912910,"01:14:29,266","01:14:30,571",Yes.
tt4912910,"01:14:30,743","01:14:33,098",And you killed him to protect me.
tt4912910,"01:14:34,691","01:14:37,230",You wanted Lark to break Lane out.
tt4912910,"01:14:38,575","01:14:41,514","No, you needed him to break Lane out."
tt4912910,"01:14:42,585","01:14:44,641",Because you have to kill Lane.
tt4912910,"01:14:46,115","01:14:47,870",Who's making you do this?
tt4912910,"01:14:49,650","01:14:51,694",<i>MI6</i>.
tt4912910,"01:14:53,970","01:14:55,225",Why?
tt4912910,"01:14:55,226","01:14:57,548",After we captured him in London they tried to
tt4912910,"01:14:57,549","01:15:00,188",bring Lane home trough diplomatic channels.
tt4912910,"01:15:00,278","01:15:03,054",But too many countries won't their pound of flesh.
tt4912910,"01:15:03,055","01:15:06,955","A man like that, what he's seen. What he knows about British intelligence."
tt4912910,"01:15:06,956","01:15:10,148","They can't have him talking to foreign government, ever."
tt4912910,"01:15:10,149","01:15:12,024",That's not what I'm asking.
tt4912910,"01:15:12,941","01:15:14,982",Why did they sent you?
tt4912910,"01:15:15,226","01:15:17,606",This is how I prove my loyalty.
tt4912910,"01:15:18,615","01:15:21,456",This is how I come home. - But you were out!?
tt4912910,"01:15:21,848","01:15:24,847",You were free? - We're never free.
tt4912910,"01:15:25,823","01:15:30,913",I've spent two years undercover with Lane. To them I'm as much of a threat as he is.
tt4912910,"01:15:32,506","01:15:36,188",I kill him or I never stop running.
tt4912910,"01:15:38,140","01:15:40,829","Now, tell me where he is?"
tt4912910,"01:15:45,496","01:15:50,044",I can't help you. - I'll get to him one way or another.
tt4912910,"01:15:50,960","01:15:53,843","Please, don't make me go trough you."
tt4912910,"01:16:49,832","01:16:50,998",Yes?
tt4912910,"01:16:50,999","01:16:53,395",Are you here in London? <i>- I am.</i>
tt4912910,"01:16:53,966","01:16:56,160",Are you ready to meet the Currier?
tt4912910,"01:16:56,706","01:16:58,806",<i>Yes. Where do I go?</i>
tt4912910,"01:16:59,295","01:17:01,434",Where would you like to meet?
tt4912910,"01:17:03,930","01:17:05,235",<i>LOCATING CALLER</i>
tt4912910,"01:17:39,295","01:17:40,600",Mr. Secretary?
tt4912910,"01:17:41,211","01:17:43,420",I've prayed to God that it wasn't truth.
tt4912910,"01:17:43,421","01:17:46,044","Well, in his defense, sir, if Ethan hadn't intervened"
tt4912910,"01:17:46,045","01:17:48,160",the great many people would've been killed.
tt4912910,"01:17:48,161","01:17:51,035","Yes, Dunn, I'm sure that the good people of Paris and the nation of France"
tt4912910,"01:17:51,036","01:17:54,140",as a whole will take that into account.
tt4912910,"01:17:54,563","01:17:56,382","So, what the hell happened?"
tt4912910,"01:18:15,553","01:18:18,358",At which point we were told to come to London.
tt4912910,"01:18:18,878","01:18:22,128",And await further instructions. - And what happens now?
tt4912910,"01:18:22,546","01:18:23,851",Now?
tt4912910,"01:18:24,842","01:18:26,341",We meet the Widow in 20 minutes.
tt4912910,"01:18:26,342","01:18:28,801",She's gonna take us to Currier who'll hand over our
tt4912910,"01:18:28,802","01:18:31,047",missing plutonium in exchange for Solomon Lane.
tt4912910,"01:18:31,048","01:18:32,878",Or in our scenario...
tt4912910,"01:18:33,888","01:18:35,193",Benji.
tt4912910,"01:18:35,674","01:18:36,979",Jesus!
tt4912910,"01:18:37,062","01:18:38,367","I'm sorry, what?"
tt4912910,"01:18:38,391","01:18:39,811",Luther and I are gonna take you to Currier.
tt4912910,"01:18:39,812","01:18:42,662",Walker stays here and guards the real Lane. - Absolutely not!
tt4912910,"01:18:42,663","01:18:45,413","Wait, wait! Why do I have to be Lane? - Benji."
tt4912910,"01:18:45,422","01:18:50,286","Our mission, my mission is to recover that plutonium and I will do so at any cost!"
tt4912910,"01:18:50,287","01:18:53,510",Even if I have to trade Lane. The real Lane!
tt4912910,"01:18:53,623","01:18:55,534",And I'll never let him go!
tt4912910,"01:18:55,568","01:18:58,626",When the Apostles realize that you're playing games
tt4912910,"01:18:58,627","01:19:01,207",you'll lose the plutonium. Again!
tt4912910,"01:19:01,283","01:19:03,044",You let us worry about the Apostles.
tt4912910,"01:19:03,045","01:19:05,812",As it stands we have a bigger problem.
tt4912910,"01:19:05,856","01:19:07,161",A bigger problem.
tt4912910,"01:19:08,027","01:19:12,405",Ilsa. - Ilsa? Our Ilsa? Ilsa Faust? How's she mixed up in all of this?
tt4912910,"01:19:12,406","01:19:15,015",She's been ordered to kill Lane. Direct from <i>MI6</i>.
tt4912910,"01:19:15,016","01:19:19,051",Look. Wait. So that was her in Paris? On the bike? - Yeah.
tt4912910,"01:19:19,052","01:19:20,893","Ethan, she tried to kill us! - No, not us."
tt4912910,"01:19:20,894","01:19:22,902","Yeah! - Not us, Lane. She tried to kill Lane."
tt4912910,"01:19:22,903","01:19:26,113",She has no choice. - And she'll kill me! - I'm not gonna let that happen!
tt4912910,"01:19:26,114","01:19:29,308","Ethan, how exactly are you not gonna let that happen?"
tt4912910,"01:19:30,496","01:19:32,415","I'm working on it. - Oh, he's working on it."
tt4912910,"01:19:32,416","01:19:33,837",Right now we don't have a lot of time.
tt4912910,"01:19:33,838","01:19:35,366",We have to start getting ready for this meeting.
tt4912910,"01:19:35,367","01:19:37,019",The meeting is a trap.
tt4912910,"01:19:38,277","01:19:42,694",The White Widow is working with the <i>CIA</i>. She has been since the beginning.
tt4912910,"01:19:42,726","01:19:45,530",Bargaining for immunity is her stock and trade.
tt4912910,"01:19:45,531","01:19:47,973",Capturing the plutonium and the Apostles and John Lark
tt4912910,"01:19:47,974","01:19:50,536",buys her a lot of good will with the Americans.
tt4912910,"01:19:50,537","01:19:53,961",But if Sloan knew the meeting was a trap why didn't she just tell us?
tt4912910,"01:19:53,962","01:19:57,990",Because in her mind anybody could be John Lark. Including one of us.
tt4912910,"01:19:59,112","01:20:01,417",And now her suspicions are confirmed.
tt4912910,"01:20:03,610","01:20:06,828",According to that dossier a trail of electronic evidence
tt4912910,"01:20:06,829","01:20:10,103",connects Hunt to the theft of smallpox from the <i>CDC</i>.
tt4912910,"01:20:10,689","01:20:12,962",It also links him to a lengthy correspondence
tt4912910,"01:20:12,963","01:20:15,490",ending with the recruitment of Dr. Debruuk.
tt4912910,"01:20:15,491","01:20:19,352",And of course Hunt handed over the plutonium to Apostles himself.
tt4912910,"01:20:19,710","01:20:24,570","Now, those facts coupled with a a long and incriminating history of rogue behavior"
tt4912910,"01:20:24,755","01:20:28,019",collaborate a <i>CIA</i> narrative
tt4912910,"01:20:28,173","01:20:30,009",that Hunt has snapped.
tt4912910,"01:20:30,664","01:20:35,136",And the search for Lark is nothing but a cover to hide the fact that Lark...
tt4912910,"01:20:35,873","01:20:37,178",... Is me.
tt4912910,"01:20:39,016","01:20:42,039","I gotta hand it to you, Ethan. Normally when people refer to"
tt4912910,"01:20:42,040","01:20:45,456",you as your own worst enemy it's just a figure of speech.
tt4912910,"01:20:49,988","01:20:53,071",I'm afraid Sloan got some questions for her as well.
tt4912910,"01:20:53,309","01:20:56,059",The Widow offered her up at no extra charge.
tt4912910,"01:20:56,708","01:20:59,236",And where did Sloan get this information?
tt4912910,"01:20:59,615","01:21:01,500",She didn't say.
tt4912910,"01:21:01,820","01:21:04,200","She did, however, grant me the opportunity to bring you"
tt4912910,"01:21:04,201","01:21:06,384",in on the condition that I terminate this mission.
tt4912910,"01:21:06,385","01:21:08,782",And hand over Solomon Lane personally.
tt4912910,"01:21:09,497","01:21:13,980","Sir, you can't do that. - Hunt! - No, I know Lane. He has no intention of going back."
tt4912910,"01:21:13,981","01:21:18,743",That's why we're taking him back! - Which means that's exactly what he wont us to do.
tt4912910,"01:21:18,744","01:21:21,104","Ethan. - Sir, what do you think, this is a coincidence?"
tt4912910,"01:21:21,105","01:21:23,438",That Sloan just happened to found this? Lane had it sent to her!
tt4912910,"01:21:23,439","01:21:27,981",He know how she'd react. Just like he knew the Widow would turn us in. Don't you see?
tt4912910,"01:21:27,982","01:21:31,510","This, sir. This is the trap!"
tt4912910,"01:21:31,807","01:21:36,469","We're being directed. - Hunt! - Sir, there are still two plutonium cores in the wind!"
tt4912910,"01:21:36,470","01:21:38,677",And you lost them!
tt4912910,"01:21:40,669","01:21:43,698","In fairness, sir, we all lost them."
tt4912910,"01:21:43,730","01:21:45,748","Respectfully, sir."
tt4912910,"01:21:45,965","01:21:50,270","You weren't there. - So, making excuses for him is your full-time job now?!"
tt4912910,"01:21:50,531","01:21:53,870","Good God, Ethan. Don't make this any harder than it already is."
tt4912910,"01:21:53,871","01:21:56,862",I can no longer protect you! Don't you understand that?
tt4912910,"01:21:56,863","01:21:59,840",This is as close as you're ever gonna get to that plutonium!
tt4912910,"01:21:59,841","01:22:03,165","Sir, you don't actually believe this? - I believe I've been given a choice"
tt4912910,"01:22:03,166","01:22:06,820",to protect you or the <i>IMF</i>. Which is why I'm bringing you in.
tt4912910,"01:22:07,616","01:22:11,257",And if I refuse? - What do you think he's here for?!
tt4912910,"01:22:11,410","01:22:14,271",You think he's some observer? He's an assassin!
tt4912910,"01:22:14,395","01:22:17,002",Erica Sloans number one <i>plumber</i>.
tt4912910,"01:22:17,119","01:22:20,091","You go rogue, he's authorized to hunt you down..."
tt4912910,"01:22:20,203","01:22:21,972",...and kill you.
tt4912910,"01:22:25,196","01:22:26,401",It's the job.
tt4912910,"01:22:26,402","01:22:27,707",No hard feeling.
tt4912910,"01:22:28,154","01:22:31,737","Except it, Ethan. You've lost this one. What's done is done."
tt4912910,"01:22:33,471","01:22:34,776","No, sir."
tt4912910,"01:22:35,107","01:22:36,412",No.
tt4912910,"01:22:36,484","01:22:41,607",I'm not asking you. I'm giving you a direct order. This mission is terminated.
tt4912910,"01:22:42,193","01:22:43,498",Now!
tt4912910,"01:22:46,528","01:22:50,667","Stickell, he's your friend. Would you, please, talk some sense into..."
tt4912910,"01:22:52,322","01:22:54,905","I'm sorry, sir. But you left me no choice."
tt4912910,"01:22:57,265","01:22:59,513",There's 15 minutes before we meet the Widow. You want the plutonium?
tt4912910,"01:22:59,514","01:23:01,586",We're the only ones who can get it for you.
tt4912910,"01:23:01,587","01:23:03,601",You're in or out?!
tt4912910,"01:23:04,474","01:23:05,611",In.
tt4912910,"01:23:05,612","01:23:08,110",What are you doing? - Benji needs to get ready.
tt4912910,"01:23:08,111","01:23:11,805","No! Ethan... - There's no time, Luther. I need you to trust me."
tt4912910,"01:23:28,711","01:23:30,016",You're all right?
tt4912910,"01:23:30,276","01:23:31,581","Yeah, I just..."
tt4912910,"01:23:32,430","01:23:34,791",...gotta a bad feeling about this one.
tt4912910,"01:24:00,398","01:24:02,259",If you don't hear from us...
tt4912910,"01:24:02,372","01:24:03,677",I'll do it my way.
tt4912910,"01:24:07,880","01:24:09,797",Don't take your eyes off him.
tt4912910,"01:24:46,264","01:24:48,285",Enough games. I'll take you out of here.
tt4912910,"01:24:48,286","01:24:49,984",Where's Hunt?
tt4912910,"01:24:50,111","01:24:53,344",He's gone to the meeting. With a copy of you. - Calm down.
tt4912910,"01:24:53,345","01:24:56,862",Call the Apostles. Warn them. - I have no way of contacting them.
tt4912910,"01:24:56,863","01:24:58,769",For their safety and mine.
tt4912910,"01:24:58,841","01:25:01,016",But I do have an extraction team and satellite over-watch
tt4912910,"01:25:01,017","01:25:02,754",at pre-arranged <i>rendezvous</i>.
tt4912910,"01:25:02,755","01:25:05,161",They'll know as soon as we leave the building. - No.
tt4912910,"01:25:05,162","01:25:08,728",I'm staying here. I haven't finished with Hunt yet.
tt4912910,"01:25:12,852","01:25:16,478",Why did you have to make this so fucking complicated?!
tt4912910,"01:25:16,837","01:25:20,129",I don't understand what do you mean? - The deal was simple.
tt4912910,"01:25:20,130","01:25:23,139",I help you frame Hunt. You give me plutonium.
tt4912910,"01:25:23,497","01:25:28,585",You're wasting time! - There can not be peace without first a great suffering.
tt4912910,"01:25:29,013","01:25:31,985","The greater the suffering, the greater the peace."
tt4912910,"01:25:32,043","01:25:36,964",When I wrote those words I wasn't referring to your peace. Or Hunts suffering.
tt4912910,"01:25:37,736","01:25:41,672",The old world order needs dismantling and we have the tools to dismantle it.
tt4912910,"01:25:41,673","01:25:46,014",All you seem to care about is that Hunt lives to take the blame.
tt4912910,"01:25:46,253","01:25:49,310",That's not anarchy. That's revenge.
tt4912910,"01:25:49,602","01:25:51,410","Yes, it is."
tt4912910,"01:25:51,722","01:25:56,236",And when I have what I want the Apostles are getting the plutonium.
tt4912910,"01:26:00,573","01:26:03,026",Hunt's the only friend you've got. You're only alive today
tt4912910,"01:26:03,027","01:26:05,363",because he didn't have the guts to kill you!
tt4912910,"01:26:05,364","01:26:08,108",Sloan is rights. The <i>IMF</i> is Halloween.
tt4912910,"01:26:08,304","01:26:10,679",Nothing but grown men wearing...
tt4912910,"01:26:17,910","01:26:19,215",What?
tt4912910,"01:26:24,774","01:26:27,890",It's just the job. No hard feelings.
tt4912910,"01:26:32,022","01:26:34,217","I've ruined your day, haven't I?"
tt4912910,"01:26:37,568","01:26:40,209",And you were doing so well up until then.
tt4912910,"01:26:40,505","01:26:42,826",And I think this one's loaded.
tt4912910,"01:26:43,059","01:26:45,021",You want to find out?
tt4912910,"01:27:26,959","01:27:29,487","So, how did I do? - I never had any doubt."
tt4912910,"01:27:31,296","01:27:33,973",I'm beginning to see why you guys enjoy this so much.
tt4912910,"01:27:33,974","01:27:37,060","Hands off, Mr. Secretary. - Man's a natural."
tt4912910,"01:27:37,150","01:27:39,067","Welcome to the team, sir."
tt4912910,"01:27:39,365","01:27:41,004",You're making a mistake.
tt4912910,"01:27:41,181","01:27:45,412","No, the mistake was mine when I saved your life over Paris."
tt4912910,"01:27:45,770","01:27:48,171",This proves nothing. I'm playing a role.
tt4912910,"01:27:48,172","01:27:50,690",Just like you're. Trying to recover that plutonium.
tt4912910,"01:27:50,691","01:27:54,412",That doesn't explain why you gave Sloan the dossier and tried to frame Hunt.
tt4912910,"01:27:54,413","01:27:57,360","He makes a good point, Lark."
tt4912910,"01:27:57,829","01:28:02,182",He's paranoid. Delusional. Just like the dossier says.
tt4912910,"01:28:02,183","01:28:05,600",So where did Sloan get the dossier from? - I have no idea.
tt4912910,"01:28:05,867","01:28:07,172",I do.
tt4912910,"01:28:10,099","01:28:13,029","Did you get all that, Erica? <i>- I did.</i>"
tt4912910,"01:28:13,553","01:28:16,313","<i>I don't appreciate being used, Walker.</i>"
tt4912910,"01:28:17,676","01:28:19,803",Bad boy.
tt4912910,"01:28:20,953","01:28:24,203",Where would you like him delivered? - I'll come to you.
tt4912910,"01:28:27,113","01:28:30,679",Nobody move! Put them down! Drop them!
tt4912910,"01:28:31,163","01:28:33,499",Hands in the air! Weapons down!
tt4912910,"01:28:33,725","01:28:35,593",Drop it! Drop it!
tt4912910,"01:28:35,907","01:28:38,231",Weapons down! Rights now! You! - It's OK. - You!
tt4912910,"01:28:38,232","01:28:40,869",It's OK. - I'm talking to you! - It's all right.
tt4912910,"01:28:40,870","01:28:44,822",I though we had a deal? <i>- We did and now we don't.</i>
tt4912910,"01:28:45,342","01:28:48,696",<i>There's too much at stake here for me to take any chances.</i>
tt4912910,"01:28:48,697","01:28:51,839",I'm bringing you all in. Along with Walker.
tt4912910,"01:28:51,921","01:28:53,481",The plutonium is still out there!
tt4912910,"01:28:53,482","01:28:56,054",And I don't trust a living soul in that room to get it.
tt4912910,"01:28:56,055","01:28:59,166",<i>We'll sort out who's who in Washington.</i>
tt4912910,"01:28:59,757","01:29:01,650",Erica! - Sir.
tt4912910,"01:29:01,988","01:29:04,682",It's all right. Let's just do what she says.
tt4912910,"01:29:05,305","01:29:08,666",The only real threats are in this room and we have them.
tt4912910,"01:29:10,969","01:29:12,274",Do you?
tt4912910,"01:29:13,435","01:29:14,740",Go!
tt4912910,"01:29:34,579","01:29:35,884",Where are they?!
tt4912910,"01:30:06,563","01:30:07,868",Ethan!
tt4912910,"01:30:31,866","01:30:33,894",First team is down. Send backup.
tt4912910,"01:30:37,191","01:30:38,496",I can...
tt4912910,"01:30:39,058","01:30:41,194","Oh, no! Man down!"
tt4912910,"01:30:44,049","01:30:45,807","Somebody, help!"
tt4912910,"01:30:54,741","01:30:56,046",Sir?
tt4912910,"01:31:00,462","01:31:04,156","Ethan, I tagged Walker but he's on the run. You gotta get him."
tt4912910,"01:31:09,565","01:31:10,870",Go.
tt4912910,"01:31:11,973","01:31:13,278","I'm sorry, sir."
tt4912910,"01:31:15,384","01:31:16,689",Go.
tt4912910,"01:31:27,343","01:31:28,648",Ethan.
tt4912910,"01:31:32,696","01:31:34,001",Wait!
tt4912910,"01:31:35,307","01:31:36,946",Get that son of a bitch!
tt4912910,"01:32:05,785","01:32:07,497",Come on! Come on!
tt4912910,"01:32:07,664","01:32:09,191","Yes, I got him!"
tt4912910,"01:32:15,647","01:32:16,952",Back!
tt4912910,"01:32:20,659","01:32:21,964",I'm sorry.
tt4912910,"01:32:22,661","01:32:24,827","Talk to me, Benji. Where's Walker?"
tt4912910,"01:32:24,865","01:32:29,170",<i>He's about quarter mile west of you. Turn right.</i> - Which way? To my right?
tt4912910,"01:32:31,604","01:32:32,909",I can't do that.
tt4912910,"01:32:32,979","01:32:34,284",Why not?
tt4912910,"01:32:35,107","01:32:38,412",Because I'm being followed. <i>- What do you mean? By who?!</i>
tt4912910,"01:32:39,036","01:32:42,005","How do I know. <i>CIA</i>, Apostles, what difference does it make?"
tt4912910,"01:32:42,006","01:32:45,230","<i>OK, OK, just get out of there and then go right.</i>"
tt4912910,"01:32:53,121","01:32:54,871",I'm terribly sorry.
tt4912910,"01:32:55,327","01:32:56,632",Excuse me.
tt4912910,"01:33:13,364","01:33:15,225",Why's he running in circles?
tt4912910,"01:33:41,955","01:33:45,816","OK, you need to cross the street on your left as soon as you can."
tt4912910,"01:33:50,955","01:33:54,260","<i>Did you copy?</i> - Yeah! <i>- Go left, now!</i> - I'm working on it!"
tt4912910,"01:34:05,501","01:34:08,640","<i>OK, now go across the street. Right in front of you!</i>"
tt4912910,"01:34:14,994","01:34:18,911","<i>Ethan, he's getting away from you. You're gonna have to go faster!</i>"
tt4912910,"01:34:48,915","01:34:51,109",You're gaining on him! Go straight.
tt4912910,"01:34:53,317","01:34:55,289",Straight! Keep moving straight!
tt4912910,"01:34:55,506","01:34:58,256",<i>Go straight. Go straight. Straight! Straight!</i>
tt4912910,"01:34:58,939","01:35:01,185","<i>OK, now turn right.</i> - Right?"
tt4912910,"01:35:02,272","01:35:05,065","Now?!<i> - Yes, right!</i> - Are you sure?!"
tt4912910,"01:35:05,452","01:35:09,821","Yes, I'm...! No it's left! Turn left! Sorry, I had screen-lock on."
tt4912910,"01:35:14,221","01:35:15,526",Left?
tt4912910,"01:35:19,349","01:35:20,654",Thank you.
tt4912910,"01:35:26,923","01:35:29,965",What are you waiting for?! - I'm jumping out of a window!
tt4912910,"01:35:29,966","01:35:32,660",What do you mean you're jumping out of...?!
tt4912910,"01:35:33,565","01:35:36,564","Oh, sorry I had it in 2D. Good luck!"
tt4912910,"01:36:11,575","01:36:15,047",At the end of the bridge turn left! You've almost got him.
tt4912910,"01:36:17,859","01:36:22,498","Come on, come on, come on! Come on, Ethan! Get him! You're right on top of him!"
tt4912910,"01:36:36,235","01:36:39,596",That's it! He's right in front of you! Get him! Get him!
tt4912910,"01:37:14,466","01:37:16,160","You can't do it, can you?"
tt4912910,"01:37:16,414","01:37:18,593",Not until you get your plutonium.
tt4912910,"01:37:18,923","01:37:21,943","No, he still has plans for you."
tt4912910,"01:37:23,035","01:37:25,910",You're gonna turn yourself in and admit you're John Lark.
tt4912910,"01:37:25,911","01:37:29,495",Then watch the old world implode from your dark little cell.
tt4912910,"01:37:29,554","01:37:31,173",And if I don't?
tt4912910,"01:37:44,267","01:37:46,382","I'm her guardian angel, Hunt."
tt4912910,"01:37:47,415","01:37:50,218","If I see you again, she dies."
tt4912910,"01:37:50,249","01:37:53,100","If you try to warn her, she dies."
tt4912910,"01:37:53,508","01:37:55,256",Know when you're beat.
tt4912910,"01:39:06,349","01:39:10,045",These are the designs we recovered from Dr. Debruuks lab in Berlin.
tt4912910,"01:39:10,046","01:39:12,431",That's a five mega-ton nuclear device.
tt4912910,"01:39:12,518","01:39:15,114",That's greater than all the explosive energy released in <i>WW2</i>.
tt4912910,"01:39:15,115","01:39:18,270",To disarm it normally we'd cut the fuse wire here.
tt4912910,"01:39:18,783","01:39:23,351",What? Normally? - Walker and Lane have two plutonium cores.
tt4912910,"01:39:23,641","01:39:27,189","Meaning two bombs. - Yeah, and they're both linked by microwave fail-safe"
tt4912910,"01:39:27,190","01:39:29,280",which is accurate to within 1/10 of a second.
tt4912910,"01:39:29,281","01:39:33,139",Any attempt to defuse one bomb automatically triggers the other.
tt4912910,"01:39:33,546","01:39:36,764",Meaning once armed the bombs can't be disarmed.
tt4912910,"01:39:36,814","01:39:41,119",The countdown is started by a remote detonator which is also a fail-safe.
tt4912910,"01:39:41,326","01:39:43,663",Meaning once the countdown starts...
tt4912910,"01:39:44,056","01:39:45,881",...it can't be stopped.
tt4912910,"01:39:47,237","01:39:49,511",So solution for this is?
tt4912910,"01:39:51,921","01:39:53,659",We're working on it.
tt4912910,"01:39:55,070","01:39:56,375",So...
tt4912910,"01:39:56,766","01:39:59,361",Technically this is a suicide mission?
tt4912910,"01:40:10,520","01:40:11,716",What is it?
tt4912910,"01:40:11,717","01:40:14,119",Come and see. Please.
tt4912910,"01:40:18,111","01:40:23,210",In all the years that I've known Ethan he's only been serious about two women.
tt4912910,"01:40:24,147","01:40:26,091",One was his wife.
tt4912910,"01:40:26,941","01:40:30,211","He's married? - No, he was."
tt4912910,"01:40:30,646","01:40:32,430",Was? What happened to her?
tt4912910,"01:40:32,946","01:40:36,700","Well, she was taken by some people who wanted to get to Ethan."
tt4912910,"01:40:37,156","01:40:39,853",It's OK. He got her back in one piece.
tt4912910,"01:40:40,521","01:40:42,822",Then he quit the game.
tt4912910,"01:40:43,055","01:40:45,169",They were happy for a while.
tt4912910,"01:40:45,721","01:40:48,437",But every time something bad happened in the world
tt4912910,"01:40:48,438","01:40:51,132",Ethan would think: <i>I should have been there</i>.
tt4912910,"01:40:51,426","01:40:56,235",And she would wonder: <i>Who's watching the world while Ethan is watching me?</i>
tt4912910,"01:40:56,654","01:40:59,663","Deep down they both knew that someday, somehow,"
tt4912910,"01:40:59,664","01:41:02,828",something truly terrible was going to happen.
tt4912910,"01:41:04,341","01:41:06,872",All because they were together.
tt4912910,"01:41:07,680","01:41:08,985",So...
tt4912910,"01:41:11,194","01:41:15,046",Where is she now? - She's a ghost. Good at it too.
tt4912910,"01:41:15,865","01:41:17,689",Taught her myself.
tt4912910,"01:41:18,101","01:41:21,720",Every now and then she sends up a signal to let Ethan know she's safe.
tt4912910,"01:41:21,721","01:41:23,459",And that keeps him going.
tt4912910,"01:41:25,310","01:41:27,171",Why are you telling me this?
tt4912910,"01:41:30,936","01:41:34,130",We're in this mess because Ethan wouldn't let me die.
tt4912910,"01:41:36,537","01:41:38,782",He's a good man.
tt4912910,"01:41:39,018","01:41:42,846",And he cares about you. More than he can admit.
tt4912910,"01:41:43,792","01:41:47,233",That's one more worry than he can handle right now.
tt4912910,"01:41:50,011","01:41:54,328","If you care about him, you should walk away."
tt4912910,"01:41:57,878","01:41:59,183",If only...
tt4912910,"01:41:59,204","01:42:00,509",Serves me right.
tt4912910,"01:42:13,157","01:42:14,629",I'm coming with you.
tt4912910,"01:42:23,597","01:42:24,902",I know.
tt4912910,"01:42:29,011","01:42:30,594","So, how do we find him?"
tt4912910,"01:42:31,843","01:42:36,339",Microwave transponder. Traceable via satellite anywhere in the world.
tt4912910,"01:42:36,661","01:42:39,466",Lane had one of these in the back of his neck.
tt4912910,"01:42:39,534","01:42:40,870",We removed it in Paris.
tt4912910,"01:42:40,871","01:42:43,905","Same time, we put our own transponder in. - Got it!"
tt4912910,"01:42:46,195","01:42:50,955",36 hour delayed activation. In case Lanes Apostles scan him.
tt4912910,"01:42:52,396","01:42:56,473","So you planned on letting him go? - Not this way, but yes."
tt4912910,"01:42:56,954","01:43:00,235",He's gonna lead us to the plutonium. - How can you be sure?
tt4912910,"01:43:00,236","01:43:02,819",His plan to put me in prison went to hell.
tt4912910,"01:43:03,605","01:43:06,133",Now he's gonna want me there for the end.
tt4912910,"01:43:06,488","01:43:09,608",So when does this transponder activate... - I got it! I got it! I got it!
tt4912910,"01:43:09,609","01:43:12,934",He's traveling east over Europe at 500 mph. - He's airborne.
tt4912910,"01:43:12,935","01:43:14,690",Should we inform the <i>CIA</i>?
tt4912910,"01:43:14,925","01:43:18,842",<i>CIA</i> has been infiltrated. I don't trust anybody outside this room.
tt4912910,"01:43:19,191","01:43:21,108",We're gonna have to go alone.
tt4912910,"01:43:23,815","01:43:25,370","So, where do we go?"
tt4912910,"01:43:45,293","01:43:46,876","How're we doing, Benji?"
tt4912910,"01:43:47,057","01:43:49,978",If there's a way to defuse this bombs I can't find it.
tt4912910,"01:43:49,979","01:43:52,340",You'll figure it out. I know you will.
tt4912910,"01:43:53,585","01:43:55,840","Damn! Ethan, we've lost the signal."
tt4912910,"01:43:56,418","01:43:58,549",Lane must have found our transmitter.
tt4912910,"01:43:58,550","01:44:01,744",What's his last position? - About 30 miles north-east.
tt4912910,"01:44:01,889","01:44:04,139",Than that's where he wants us to go.
tt4912910,"01:44:04,355","01:44:07,795",What's there? - The Nubra river valley. There's only a medical camp there.
tt4912910,"01:44:07,796","01:44:09,948",<i>Humanitarian Aid Overseas</i>.
tt4912910,"01:44:10,568","01:44:13,191",Why would Lane target a medical camp?
tt4912910,"01:44:14,130","01:44:15,435",Smallpox.
tt4912910,"01:44:16,625","01:44:20,508",What? - Smallpox. The Apostles triggered smallpox outbreak in Kashmir.
tt4912910,"01:44:20,509","01:44:23,481",Lane must've wanted that camp there for a reason.
tt4912910,"01:44:23,495","01:44:27,087",But what? - Oh my God! - What is it?
tt4912910,"01:44:28,039","01:44:31,400","Well, the Nubra river is at the base of Siachen glacier."
tt4912910,"01:44:31,556","01:44:33,683",So nuclear blast there would irradiate the
tt4912910,"01:44:33,684","01:44:36,545",largest natural irrigation system in the world.
tt4912910,"01:44:36,856","01:44:40,946",Fresh water from the border of China to India and Pakistan.
tt4912910,"01:44:42,091","01:44:44,297",They're gonna starve one third of the worlds population!
tt4912910,"01:44:44,298","01:44:46,333",The greater the suffering...
tt4912910,"01:44:46,334","01:44:48,486",... The greater the peace.
tt4912910,"01:44:49,014","01:44:51,813",I still don't understand why Lane wants a medical camp there.
tt4912910,"01:44:51,814","01:44:56,030",It doesn't matter. All that matters now is that we find a way to defuse those bombs.
tt4912910,"01:44:56,031","01:44:57,959",I think I've found it.
tt4912910,"01:44:58,215","01:45:02,193",Maybe. But there appears to a flaw in bombs operating system.
tt4912910,"01:45:02,213","01:45:05,687",The remote detonator requires that firing key. If you remove that key
tt4912910,"01:45:05,688","01:45:09,535",then it should short-out the fail-safe and allow us to cut both fuses.
tt4912910,"01:45:09,536","01:45:12,529",So one of us needs to get the detonator and remove that key.
tt4912910,"01:45:12,530","01:45:15,884","Yeah, while... - While the rest of us cut the fuses on both bombs."
tt4912910,"01:45:15,885","01:45:18,347","Simple. - Yeah, but..."
tt4912910,"01:45:18,736","01:45:19,970",But what?
tt4912910,"01:45:19,971","01:45:23,427",Well in order to make this work we can't remove the key
tt4912910,"01:45:23,428","01:45:26,858",or cut the fuses until after the countdown starts.
tt4912910,"01:45:28,087","01:45:31,228","Wait, wait! Just so I got this clear. Our only chance to safely defuse"
tt4912910,"01:45:31,229","01:45:34,596",both bombs is to let the countdown start?
tt4912910,"01:45:35,225","01:45:37,840",And then remove that key.
tt4912910,"01:45:46,407","01:45:47,712",OK.
tt4912910,"01:46:05,432","01:46:08,450",Both devices are now connected to the detonator.
tt4912910,"01:46:09,839","01:46:13,978",15 minutes should give you enough time to reach minimum safe distance.
tt4912910,"01:46:16,281","01:46:18,442",My running days are over.
tt4912910,"01:46:19,452","01:46:21,471",This is where it ends for me.
tt4912910,"01:46:50,601","01:46:52,665",I'm getting signals all over the place.
tt4912910,"01:46:52,666","01:46:54,824","That's why the medical camp. X-ray machines,"
tt4912910,"01:46:54,825","01:46:57,883","CAT-scanners, radiological signatures everywhere."
tt4912910,"01:46:57,884","01:47:00,214",Looks like a needle in a haystack. - Process of elimination.
tt4912910,"01:47:00,215","01:47:03,413",One at a time. Let's split up. Stay on comms.
tt4912910,"01:47:13,463","01:47:14,768",Ethan?
tt4912910,"01:47:20,421","01:47:21,726",Julia?
tt4912910,"01:47:26,430","01:47:27,735",Is that?
tt4912910,"01:47:31,777","01:47:33,082",Julia!
tt4912910,"01:47:35,334","01:47:36,639",Does he know?
tt4912910,"01:47:38,243","01:47:41,276","Hey. - This is my husband, Eric."
tt4912910,"01:47:41,822","01:47:44,889","This is... - Rob, Rob Thorn. Dr. Rob Thorn."
tt4912910,"01:47:45,315","01:47:49,048","I worked with Julia at... - Mass General, before New York."
tt4912910,"01:47:49,225","01:47:53,776","Oh, you're kidding? What a coincidence? - I know. I... - What brings you all this way?"
tt4912910,"01:47:53,777","01:47:56,360","I was in Turtuk, not far from here."
tt4912910,"01:47:56,675","01:47:59,252",And heard help is needed.
tt4912910,"01:47:59,526","01:48:02,342","Oh, well... Actually we're just about finished here."
tt4912910,"01:48:02,343","01:48:05,321",The whole village is inoculated but...
tt4912910,"01:48:05,813","01:48:07,785",What were you doing at Turtuk?
tt4912910,"01:48:08,130","01:48:09,869",Rob's on vacation.
tt4912910,"01:48:10,046","01:48:12,731","No... No, I'm working."
tt4912910,"01:48:14,942","01:48:16,803",You're a long way from home.
tt4912910,"01:48:17,015","01:48:19,712","Yeah, yeah. Thanks to our guardian angel."
tt4912910,"01:48:19,881","01:48:20,946",Guardian?
tt4912910,"01:48:20,947","01:48:23,557","Well, yeah. We were running a field hospital outside of Darfur"
tt4912910,"01:48:23,558","01:48:25,123",when outbreak happened here.
tt4912910,"01:48:25,124","01:48:28,401",Here comes this phone call from an anonymous donor. Out of the blue.
tt4912910,"01:48:28,402","01:48:32,819",And he says he's ready to underwrite the entire operation. One condition...
tt4912910,"01:48:33,212","01:48:35,393",We run the whole thing.
tt4912910,"01:48:35,607","01:48:37,079",Can you believe that?
tt4912910,"01:48:37,798","01:48:39,501",I certainly can.

tt4912910,"01:48:45,351","01:48:49,582","It's quite a full life. - Yeah, you know before Julia I never traveled."
tt4912910,"01:48:49,664","01:48:51,041",<i>I never even left New York.</i>

tt4912910,"01:48:57,125","01:49:00,606",<i>I was just patient checking. You keep the circuit at 50. Heart attack at 55.</i>
tt4912910,"01:49:00,607","01:49:03,425",And she convinced me to let it all go.
tt4912910,"01:49:03,997","01:49:07,802",Help where it's needed most. So we've been on the go ever since.
tt4912910,"01:49:08,085","01:49:10,113",I've never been more fulfilled.

tt4912910,"01:49:22,577","01:49:24,294","Oh no, I should get out of your hair."
tt4912910,"01:49:24,295","01:49:26,569",Are you kidding? You should stick around.
tt4912910,"01:49:26,570","01:49:29,542",I'm just sorry you came all this way for nothing.
tt4912910,"01:49:30,796","01:49:35,426",I'll tell you what. We'll pack and why don't we give you a ride back to Turtuk.
tt4912910,"01:49:35,427","01:49:37,382",You two can catch up in the car.
tt4912910,"01:49:37,383","01:49:38,645",Yeah?
tt4912910,"01:49:38,646","01:49:39,951",You're very kind.

tt4912910,"01:50:31,269","01:50:33,712",It's armed but the countdown hasn't started yet.
tt4912910,"01:50:33,713","01:50:36,261",The network signal's strong which means the other device is close by.
tt4912910,"01:50:36,262","01:50:39,892",And the detonator. By half km in that direction.
tt4912910,"01:50:40,990","01:50:42,726",They're still here.

tt4912910,"02:13:36,846","02:13:39,002",OK. We're ready. <i>- Two seconds we cut!</i>
tt4912910,"02:13:39,003","02:13:41,828","Wait, wait! Why two? Why not one? - You want to cut it that close?"
tt4912910,"02:13:41,829","02:13:43,416","Well, it's the second we'll never get back!"
tt4912910,"02:13:43,417","02:13:46,073",Wait! Can we make a decision on this?! - Alright! We'll do it on one!
tt4912910,"02:13:46,074","02:13:48,824","Cutting on one? - Yes, one! Alright, stand by."
tt4912910,"02:13:51,153","02:13:55,059","3, 2, 1, now!"
tt4912910,"02:14:33,668","02:14:34,973",OK.
tt4912910,"02:14:46,157","02:14:47,462",My man.
tt4912910,"02:15:40,861","02:15:42,166",Ethan?
tt4912910,"02:15:45,815","02:15:47,120",Can you hear me?
tt4912910,"02:15:50,900","02:15:52,672","No, don't, don't."
tt4912910,"02:15:53,345","02:15:54,650",Don't try to move.
tt4912910,"02:15:55,077","02:15:56,138",Don't move.
tt4912910,"02:15:56,139","02:15:57,778",You're pretty banged up.
tt4912910,"02:16:00,787","02:16:02,069",You're a lucky man.
tt4912910,"02:16:02,070","02:16:05,034",It's a miracle that crash didn't kill you Dr. Thorn.
tt4912910,"02:16:05,035","02:16:08,234",If your friend didn't find you an hour later you would've died from exposure.
tt4912910,"02:16:08,235","02:16:10,251",My friend? - Yeah.
tt4912910,"02:16:12,725","02:16:15,030",She got here not long after you left.
tt4912910,"02:16:15,369","02:16:17,786",Right in front of half the Indian army.
tt4912910,"02:16:18,419","02:16:21,058","Can you give us just a few minutes, please?"
tt4912910,"02:16:22,775","02:16:24,946","See you later, doc."
tt4912910,"02:16:31,369","02:16:32,674","Julia,"
tt4912910,"02:16:34,031","02:16:35,336",I'm sorry.
tt4912910,"02:16:36,008","02:16:38,603",There's no reason to be sorry. - No.
tt4912910,"02:16:38,900","02:16:40,205",I'm sorry...
tt4912910,"02:16:41,672","02:16:43,200",...for everything. I...
tt4912910,"02:16:45,344","02:16:46,649",Look at me.
tt4912910,"02:16:47,655","02:16:48,960",Look at me.
tt4912910,"02:16:49,307","02:16:51,421",Look at my life.
tt4912910,"02:16:52,520","02:16:58,023",I love what I do and I never would've found this if I hadn't met you.
tt4912910,"02:16:58,984","02:17:01,476",Everything that happened...
tt4912910,"02:17:01,926","02:17:07,936",...though me a way and showed me what I'm capable of and I...
tt4912910,"02:17:08,464","02:17:10,782",I'm a survivor.
tt4912910,"02:17:11,271","02:17:13,647",But what happened here...
tt4912910,"02:17:14,002","02:17:17,754",It was my... - Nothing happened. Because you were here.
tt4912910,"02:17:20,145","02:17:24,618",And I sleep soundly at night knowing you always will be.
tt4912910,"02:17:32,921","02:17:34,226",You're happy?
tt4912910,"02:17:34,360","02:17:35,665",Very.
tt4912910,"02:17:39,012","02:17:41,506",I'm exactly where I should be.
tt4912910,"02:17:43,528","02:17:46,190",And so are you.
tt4912910,"02:18:24,673","02:18:26,302",Per your request.
tt4912910,"02:18:27,440","02:18:30,844",I'm handing Solomon Lane back to <i>MI6</i>.
tt4912910,"02:18:35,519","02:18:37,911","Trough a broker, of course."
tt4912910,"02:18:39,843","02:18:42,649",Part of our ongoing arrangement.
tt4912910,"02:18:47,865","02:18:49,802",After what happened in Paris
tt4912910,"02:18:50,438","02:18:53,292",we prefer to keep a low profile.
tt4912910,"02:18:55,390","02:19:00,474",And that closes your friends account with British intelligence.
tt4912910,"02:19:01,675","02:19:04,349",The ribs. Watch the ribs.
tt4912910,"02:19:04,612","02:19:07,867",I understand now why Hunley believed in you.
tt4912910,"02:19:08,377","02:19:11,157",The world needs the <i>IMF</i>.
tt4912910,"02:19:11,521","02:19:13,803",We need people like you.
tt4912910,"02:19:13,804","02:19:16,143",Who care about the one life
tt4912910,"02:19:16,674","02:19:20,021",as much as they care about the millions.
tt4912910,"02:19:21,367","02:19:24,727",That way I never have to.
tt4912910,"02:19:25,576","02:19:26,881",You're OK?
tt4912910,"02:19:27,919","02:19:30,063",You've never looked better. - Don’t!
tt4912910,"02:19:32,713","02:19:34,712",How close were we?
tt4912910,"02:19:37,146","02:19:38,451",The usual.
tt4912910,"02:19:42,730","02:19:44,035",Usual?
tt4912910,"02:19:45,773","02:19:47,909","Please, don't make me lough."
