Forrest.Gump,"00:03:17,948","00:03:19,189",Hello.
Forrest.Gump,"00:03:20,158","00:03:22,821",My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.
Forrest.Gump,"00:03:28,375","00:03:30,412",Do you want a chocolate?
Forrest.Gump,"00:03:33,004","00:03:36,418",I could eat about a million and a half of these.
Forrest.Gump,"00:03:37,592","00:03:42,804",My mama always said life was like a box of chocolates.
Forrest.Gump,"00:03:44,808","00:03:47,676",You never know what you're gonna get.
Forrest.Gump,"00:03:54,901","00:03:57,439",Those must be comfortable shoes.
Forrest.Gump,"00:03:58,822","00:04:03,487",I'll bet you could walk all day in shoes like that and not feel a thing.
Forrest.Gump,"00:04:05,704","00:04:08,162",I wish I had shoes like that.
Forrest.Gump,"00:04:08,832","00:04:10,368",My feet hurt.
Forrest.Gump,"00:04:11,585","00:04:13,247",Mama always said there's an awful lot
Forrest.Gump,"00:04:13,336","00:04:16,545",you could tell about a person by their shoes:
Forrest.Gump,"00:04:17,674","00:04:20,633","where they're going, where they've been."
Forrest.Gump,"00:04:27,893","00:04:29,930",I've worn lots of shoes.
Forrest.Gump,"00:04:33,064","00:04:37,855","I bet if I think about it real hard, I could remember my first pair of shoes."
Forrest.Gump,"00:04:40,781","00:04:43,398",Mama said they'd take me anywhere.
Forrest.Gump,"00:04:44,201","00:04:46,818",<i>She said they was my magic shoes.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:04:46,912","00:04:50,076","All right, Forrest, you can open your eyes now."
Forrest.Gump,"00:04:57,380","00:04:59,838",Let's take a little walk around.
Forrest.Gump,"00:05:06,640","00:05:08,427",How do those feel?
Forrest.Gump,"00:05:11,394","00:05:13,556","His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:05:13,647","00:05:16,139","as strong as I've ever seen,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:05:16,233","00:05:19,601",but his back is as crooked as a politician.
Forrest.Gump,"00:05:20,904","00:05:23,988","But we're gonna straighten him right up, now, aren't we, Forrest?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:05:24,074","00:05:25,190",Forrest!
Forrest.Gump,"00:05:26,701","00:05:27,908","<i>Now, when I was a baby,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:05:27,994","00:05:30,828","<i>Mama named me after the great Civil War hero,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:05:30,914","00:05:33,327",<i>General Nathan Bedford Forrest.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:05:33,416","00:05:35,624",<i>She said we was related to him in some way.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:05:35,710","00:05:37,076","<i>And what he did was,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:05:37,170","00:05:41,414",<i>he started up this club called the Ku Klux Klan.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:05:41,508","00:05:44,842",<i>They'd all dress up in theirrobes and their bed sheets</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:05:44,928","00:05:49,263",<i>and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:05:49,349","00:05:53,218",<i>They'd even put bed sheets on their horses and ride around.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:05:53,311","00:05:56,349","<i>And anyway, that's how I got my name,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:05:56,439","00:05:57,850",<i>Forrest Gump.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:05:57,941","00:05:59,682","<i>Mama said that the ""Forrest"" part</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:05:59,776","00:06:03,315","<i>was to remind me that sometimes we all do things that,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:06:03,405","00:06:06,193","<i>well, just don't make no sense.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:06:11,872","00:06:15,365","Okay... Get it, get it..."
Forrest.Gump,"00:06:15,458","00:06:18,417","Wait, is it this way? Hold on."
Forrest.Gump,"00:06:19,337","00:06:20,828",All right...
Forrest.Gump,"00:06:21,423","00:06:23,085",What are you all staring at?
Forrest.Gump,"00:06:23,174","00:06:27,635",Haven't you ever seen a little boy with braces on his legs before?
Forrest.Gump,"00:06:29,180","00:06:32,890","Don't ever let anybody tell you they're better than you, Forrest."
Forrest.Gump,"00:06:32,976","00:06:35,559","If God intended everybody to be the same,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:06:35,645","00:06:37,762",he'd have given us all braces on our legs.
Forrest.Gump,"00:06:37,856","00:06:41,645",<i>Mama always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:06:43,111","00:06:46,604","<i>We lived about a quarter mile off Route 17,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:06:46,698","00:06:49,736","<i>about a half mile from the town of Greenbow, Alabama.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:06:49,826","00:06:52,569",<i>That's in the county of Greenbow.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:06:52,662","00:06:57,077",<i>Our house had been in Mama's family since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:06:57,167","00:06:59,079","<i>had come across the ocean about 1,000 years ago,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:06:59,169","00:07:01,081",<i>something like that.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:07:01,171","00:07:03,879","<i>Since it was just me and Mama and we had all these empty rooms,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:07:03,965","00:07:06,708","<i>Mama decided to let those rooms out,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:07:06,801","00:07:08,758","<i>mostly to people passing through,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:07:08,845","00:07:12,805","<i>like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery, places like that.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:07:12,891","00:07:15,599",<i>That's how me and Mama got money.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:07:15,685","00:07:18,428",<i>Mama was a real smart lady.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:07:18,521","00:07:23,516","Remember what I told you, Forrest. You're no different than anybody else is."
Forrest.Gump,"00:07:26,029","00:07:28,396","Did you hear what I said, Forrest?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:07:28,490","00:07:32,655",You're the same as everybody else. You are no different.
Forrest.Gump,"00:07:33,161","00:07:37,622","Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump."
Forrest.Gump,"00:07:37,707","00:07:39,915","Now, his IQ is 75."
Forrest.Gump,"00:07:40,710","00:07:43,828","Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock."
Forrest.Gump,"00:07:47,425","00:07:49,462","<i>She wanted me to have the finest education,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:07:49,552","00:07:53,466",<i>so she took me to the Greenbow County Central School.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:07:53,556","00:07:55,798",<i>I met the principal and all.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:07:56,309","00:07:59,177","I want to show you something, Mrs. Gump."
Forrest.Gump,"00:07:59,646","00:08:02,514","Now, this is normal."
Forrest.Gump,"00:08:03,024","00:08:06,313",Forrest is right here.
Forrest.Gump,"00:08:07,153","00:08:12,694","The state requires a minimum IQ of 80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump."
Forrest.Gump,"00:08:13,201","00:08:16,069",He's gonna have to go to a special school.
Forrest.Gump,"00:08:16,162","00:08:18,279","Now, he'll be just fine."
Forrest.Gump,"00:08:19,082","00:08:21,165","What does ""normal"" mean, anyway?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:08:21,251","00:08:24,619","He might be a bit on the slow side,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:08:25,755","00:08:27,496",but my boy Forrest is gonna get
Forrest.Gump,"00:08:27,590","00:08:30,128",the same opportunities as everyone else.
Forrest.Gump,"00:08:30,218","00:08:34,007",He's not going to some special school to learn how to re-tread tires.
Forrest.Gump,"00:08:34,097","00:08:37,261",We're talking about five little points here.
Forrest.Gump,"00:08:38,977","00:08:41,594",There must be something can be done.
Forrest.Gump,"00:08:43,189","00:08:45,647",We're a progressive school system.
Forrest.Gump,"00:08:46,484","00:08:49,397",We don't want to see anybody left behind.
Forrest.Gump,"00:08:50,280","00:08:53,739","Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:08:56,995","00:08:58,861",He's on vacation.
Forrest.Gump,"00:09:16,347","00:09:20,136","Well, your mama sure does care about your schooling, son."
Forrest.Gump,"00:09:25,648","00:09:28,106","You don't say much, do you?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:09:39,621","00:09:41,578","""Finally, he had to try."
Forrest.Gump,"00:09:41,664","00:09:43,621","""It looked easy, but,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:09:44,834","00:09:47,167","""oh, what happened."
Forrest.Gump,"00:09:47,253","00:09:50,246","- ""First, there..."" - Mama, what's ""vacation"" mean?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:09:50,799","00:09:53,382",- Vacation? - Where Daddy went.
Forrest.Gump,"00:09:56,012","00:09:58,720",Vacation's when you go somewhere
Forrest.Gump,"00:10:01,101","00:10:03,434",and you don't ever come back.
Forrest.Gump,"00:10:07,774","00:10:11,563","<i>Anyway, I guess you could say me and Mama was on our own.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:10:12,779","00:10:16,398",<i>But we didn't mind. Our house was never empty.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:10:16,491","00:10:19,074",<i>There was always folks coming and going.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:10:19,160","00:10:20,241",Supper.
Forrest.Gump,"00:10:20,328","00:10:23,742","- It's supper, everyone. Forrest... - My, my. That sure looks special."
Forrest.Gump,"00:10:23,832","00:10:26,370",<i>Sometimes we had so many people staying with us</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:10:26,459","00:10:29,122",<i>that every room was filled with travelers.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:10:29,212","00:10:32,831","<i>You know, folks living out of their suitcases</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:10:32,924","00:10:35,883",<i>and hat cases and sample cases.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:10:35,969","00:10:39,383","Forrest Gump, it's suppertime! Forrest..."
Forrest.Gump,"00:10:39,472","00:10:42,010","<i>One time, a young man was staying with us,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:10:42,100","00:10:45,719",<i>and he had him a guitar case.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:10:59,701","00:11:03,695",Forrest! I told you not to bother this nice young man.
Forrest.Gump,"00:11:03,788","00:11:05,120","Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am."
Forrest.Gump,"00:11:05,206","00:11:08,040",I was just showing him a thing or two on the guitar here.
Forrest.Gump,"00:11:08,126","00:11:11,085","All right, but your supper's ready if y'all want to eat."
Forrest.Gump,"00:11:11,171","00:11:14,130","Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you, ma'am."
Forrest.Gump,"00:11:14,799","00:11:18,383","Say, man, show me that crazy little walk you just did there."
Forrest.Gump,"00:11:18,469","00:11:20,335",Slow it down some.
Forrest.Gump,"00:11:22,473","00:11:24,385",<i>I liked that guitar.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:11:25,059","00:11:26,800",<i>It sounded good.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:11:28,605","00:11:32,770","<i>I started moving around to the music,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:11:32,859","00:11:34,691",<i>swinging my hips.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:11:37,280","00:11:39,818","<i>This one night, me and Mama was out shopping,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:11:39,908","00:11:42,901","<i>and we walked right by Benson's furniture and appliance store,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:11:42,994","00:11:44,576",<i>and guess what?</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:11:56,925","00:11:59,759",This is not for children's eyes.
Forrest.Gump,"00:12:02,305","00:12:04,092","<i>Some years later, that handsome young man</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:12:04,182","00:12:06,720","<i>who they called ""The King,""</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:12:06,809","00:12:09,142","<i>well, he'd sung too many songs,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:12:09,812","00:12:12,350","<i>had himself a heart attack, or something.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:12:13,441","00:12:15,603",Must be hard being a king.
Forrest.Gump,"00:12:19,906","00:12:22,946","You know, it's funny how you remember some things, but some things you can't."
Forrest.Gump,"00:12:23,493","00:12:27,362","- You do your very best now, Forrest. - I sure will, Mama."
Forrest.Gump,"00:12:29,082","00:12:33,668",<i>I remember the bus ride on the first day of school very well.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:12:37,215","00:12:38,922",Are you coming along?
Forrest.Gump,"00:12:39,008","00:12:42,501",Mama said not to be taking rides from strangers.
Forrest.Gump,"00:12:42,595","00:12:44,757",This is the bus to school.
Forrest.Gump,"00:12:47,725","00:12:49,967",I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.
Forrest.Gump,"00:12:50,937","00:12:54,931","- I'm Dorothy Harris. - Well, now we ain't strangers anymore."
Forrest.Gump,"00:13:07,954","00:13:09,741",This seat's taken.
Forrest.Gump,"00:13:12,208","00:13:13,699",It's taken!
Forrest.Gump,"00:13:21,592","00:13:23,458",You can't sit here.
Forrest.Gump,"00:13:25,638","00:13:29,052","<i>You know, it's funny what a young man recollects,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:13:29,142","00:13:31,509",<i>'cause I don't remember being born.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:13:33,146","00:13:35,308","I don't recall what I got for my first Christmas,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:13:35,398","00:13:38,482",and I don't know when I went on my first outdoor picnic.
Forrest.Gump,"00:13:38,568","00:13:43,279",But I do remember the first time I heard
Forrest.Gump,"00:13:43,364","00:13:46,198",the sweetest voice in the wide world.
Forrest.Gump,"00:13:46,701","00:13:49,068",You can sit here if you want.
Forrest.Gump,"00:13:51,998","00:13:55,867",<i>I had never seen anything so beautiful in my life.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:13:56,586","00:13:58,669",<i>She was like an angel.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:13:58,755","00:14:01,668","Well, are you gonna sit down, or aren't you?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:14:06,637","00:14:08,424",What's wrong with your legs?
Forrest.Gump,"00:14:08,514","00:14:12,758","Nothing at all, thank you. My legs are just fine and dandy."
Forrest.Gump,"00:14:13,686","00:14:15,848",<i>I just sat next to her on that bus</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:14:15,938","00:14:18,021",<i>and had a conversation all the way to school.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:14:18,107","00:14:20,815",...my back's crooked like a question mark.
Forrest.Gump,"00:14:20,902","00:14:22,063",These are going to make me...
Forrest.Gump,"00:14:22,153","00:14:26,898","<i>And next to Mama, no one ever talked to me or asked me questions.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:14:27,450","00:14:29,407",Are you stupid or something?
Forrest.Gump,"00:14:29,494","00:14:32,487","Mama says, ""Stupid is as stupid does."""
Forrest.Gump,"00:14:34,123","00:14:37,787",- I'm Jenny. - I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.
Forrest.Gump,"00:14:38,461","00:14:40,293","<i>From that day on, we was always together.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:14:40,380","00:14:43,214",<i>Jenny and me was like peas and carrots.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:14:46,803","00:14:48,419",<i>She taught me how to climb.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:14:48,513","00:14:51,221","Come on, Forrest, you can do it."
Forrest.Gump,"00:14:51,307","00:14:53,924",<i>I showed her how to dangle.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:14:54,018","00:14:56,055","""...a good little monkey and..."""
Forrest.Gump,"00:14:56,145","00:15:01,061","<i>She helped me learn how to read, and I showed her how to swing.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:15:03,403","00:15:07,147",<i>Sometimes we'd just sit out and wait for the stars.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:15:07,240","00:15:12,156",- Mama's gonna worry about me. - Just stay a little longer.
Forrest.Gump,"00:15:13,413","00:15:17,157","<i>For some reason, Jenny didn't never want to go home.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:15:17,250","00:15:19,333","Okay, Jenny, I'll stay."
Forrest.Gump,"00:15:20,169","00:15:22,912",<i>She was my most special friend.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:15:26,342","00:15:28,004",My only friend.
Forrest.Gump,"00:15:31,806","00:15:35,595","Now, my mama always told me that miracles happen every day."
Forrest.Gump,"00:15:35,685","00:15:38,052","Some people don't think so, but they do."
Forrest.Gump,"00:15:41,107","00:15:42,689","Hey, dummy!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:15:43,651","00:15:45,734","Are you retarded, or just plain stupid?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:15:45,820","00:15:49,313","- ""Look, I'm Forrest Gimp."" - Just run away, Forrest."
Forrest.Gump,"00:15:50,658","00:15:53,742","Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:15:53,828","00:15:57,071",- Get the bikes! - Hurry up! Let's get him!
Forrest.Gump,"00:15:57,165","00:15:59,703","- Come on! - Look out, dummy, here we come!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:15:59,792","00:16:01,624",We're gonna get you!
Forrest.Gump,"00:16:02,587","00:16:06,331","Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:16:08,050","00:16:09,962","Come back here, you!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:16:23,608","00:16:26,066","Run, Forrest!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:16:26,152","00:16:27,563",Run!
Forrest.Gump,"00:16:58,768","00:17:01,636","<i>Now, you wouldn't believe it if I told you,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:17:02,772","00:17:05,264",but I can run like the wind blows.
Forrest.Gump,"00:17:08,528","00:17:11,612","From that day on, if I was going somewhere,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:17:12,448","00:17:13,734",I was running!
Forrest.Gump,"00:17:13,824","00:17:16,191",He's getting away! Stop him!
Forrest.Gump,"00:17:47,650","00:17:50,643",That boy sure is a running fool.
Forrest.Gump,"00:17:54,865","00:17:56,231","<i>Now, remember how I told you that</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:17:56,325","00:17:59,238",<i>Jenny never seemed to want to go home?</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:17:59,328","00:18:02,412","<i>Well, she lived in a house that was as old as Alabama.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:18:02,498","00:18:04,660","<i>Her mama had gone up to heaven when she was five,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:18:04,750","00:18:08,084",<i>and her daddy was some kind of a farmer.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:18:09,922","00:18:10,958",Jenny?
Forrest.Gump,"00:18:11,048","00:18:13,210",<i>He was a very loving man.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:18:13,676","00:18:17,920",<i>He was always kissing and touching her and her sisters.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:18:19,682","00:18:24,097","<i>And then this one time, Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:18:25,271","00:18:28,139","Jenny, why didn't you come to school today?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:18:28,232","00:18:30,269",Daddy's taking a nap.
Forrest.Gump,"00:18:30,359","00:18:32,066",- Jenny! - Come on!
Forrest.Gump,"00:18:33,529","00:18:36,067","Jenny, where'd you run to?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:18:37,408","00:18:40,071","You'd better get back here, girl!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:18:41,537","00:18:43,199",Where you at?
Forrest.Gump,"00:18:46,584","00:18:49,873",Jenny! Jenny! Where you at?
Forrest.Gump,"00:18:52,882","00:18:54,214",Jenny!
Forrest.Gump,"00:18:54,300","00:18:57,259","Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me."
Forrest.Gump,"00:18:57,386","00:18:58,502",Jenny!
Forrest.Gump,"00:18:58,596","00:19:01,805","Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:19:01,891","00:19:03,632","far, far away from here."
Forrest.Gump,"00:19:03,726","00:19:07,390","Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:19:07,480","00:19:08,596","far, far away from here."
Forrest.Gump,"00:19:08,731","00:19:11,769",<i>Mama always said that God is mysterious.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:19:11,901","00:19:13,017",Jenny!
Forrest.Gump,"00:19:13,110","00:19:15,443",<i>He didn't turn Jenny into a bird that day.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:19:15,571","00:19:16,652",You'd better get back here!
Forrest.Gump,"00:19:16,739","00:19:18,230","<i>Instead,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:19:18,908","00:19:23,448",<i>he had the police say Jenny didn't have to stay in that house no more.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:19:23,913","00:19:27,623","<i>She went to live with her grandma just over on Creekmore Avenue,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:19:27,750","00:19:30,914","<i>which made me happy, 'cause she was so close.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:19:33,506","00:19:38,547","<i>Some nights, Jenny would sneak out and come on over to my house,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:19:38,636","00:19:41,754",<i>just 'cause she said she was scared.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:19:41,847","00:19:44,305","<i>Scared of what, I don't know,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:19:44,433","00:19:47,642",<i>but I think it was her grandma's dog.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:19:47,770","00:19:49,511",<i>He was a mean dog.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:19:50,272","00:19:52,980","<i>Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:19:53,067","00:19:54,467",<i>all the way up through high school.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:19:56,320","00:19:58,357","- Hey, stupid! - Quit it!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:19:59,490","00:20:01,777","- Run, Forrest, run! - Hey,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:20:02,493","00:20:03,950","did you hear me, stupid?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:20:04,036","00:20:05,305","- Run, Forrest! - Come on, get in the truck!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:20:05,329","00:20:07,446",Get in the truck! Let's move it!
Forrest.Gump,"00:20:07,540","00:20:10,283","Come on, he's getting away! Move it!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:20:10,376","00:20:12,538","Run, Forrest! Run!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:20:12,628","00:20:16,167","- You better be running, stupid! - Come on, dummy!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:20:18,134","00:20:21,627","- Haul ass, dummy! - Yeah, you better get running!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:20:24,640","00:20:26,302",Jack rabbit!
Forrest.Gump,"00:20:34,734","00:20:35,975",Yeah!
Forrest.Gump,"00:20:36,819","00:20:38,981",Go! Go! Go!
Forrest.Gump,"00:20:40,698","00:20:42,314","Run, Forrest!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:20:45,327","00:20:48,911","Now, it used to be, I ran to get where I was going,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:20:50,499","00:20:52,991",I never thought it would take me anywhere.
Forrest.Gump,"00:21:22,031","00:21:26,196","- Who in the hell is that? - That there is Forrest Gump, Coach."
Forrest.Gump,"00:21:27,203","00:21:29,035",Just a local idiot.
Forrest.Gump,"00:21:29,705","00:21:33,198","<i>And can you believe it? I got to go to college, too.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:21:39,799","00:21:42,416",Forrest! Forrest! Run!
Forrest.Gump,"00:21:42,551","00:21:44,133",- Okay! - Run!
Forrest.Gump,"00:21:44,220","00:21:47,759","Run, you stupid son of a bitch! Run!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:21:59,235","00:22:02,774",You son of a bitch! Run! Go! Run!
Forrest.Gump,"00:22:05,157","00:22:07,900",No! Turn! Go!
Forrest.Gump,"00:22:19,129","00:22:22,748","He must be the stupidest son of a bitch alive,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:22:22,842","00:22:24,754",but he sure is fast!
Forrest.Gump,"00:22:27,763","00:22:32,758","<i>Now, maybe it's just me, but college was very confusing times.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:22:34,103","00:22:36,015",<i>Federal troops enforcing a court order</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:22:36,105","00:22:39,098",<i>integrated the University of Alabama today.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:22:39,191","00:22:40,398","<i>Two negroes were admitted,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:22:40,484","00:22:43,773",<i>but only after Governor George Wallace had carried out his symbolic threat</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:22:43,863","00:22:45,399",<i>to stand in the school house door.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:22:45,489","00:22:50,154","<i>Governor Wallace, I take it from that statement, that...</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:22:50,286","00:22:52,278","Earl, what's going on?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:22:52,371","00:22:55,705",- Coons are trying to get into school. - Coons?
Forrest.Gump,"00:22:55,791","00:22:57,471","When raccoons try to get on our back porch,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:22:57,543","00:22:59,330",Mama just chase them off with a broom.
Forrest.Gump,"00:22:59,461","00:23:03,956","Not raccoons, you idiot, niggers, and they want to go to school with us."
Forrest.Gump,"00:23:04,466","00:23:06,503",With us? They do?
Forrest.Gump,"00:23:07,469","00:23:09,961",<i>Shortly after Governor Wallace had carried out his promise</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:23:10,055","00:23:11,262","<i>to block the doorway,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:23:11,348","00:23:13,308",<i>President Kennedy ordered the Secretary of Defense</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:23:13,392","00:23:15,384",<i>then to use military force.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:23:15,477","00:23:18,185","<i>Here, by videotape, is the encounter by General Graham,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:23:18,314","00:23:21,557","<i>commander of the National Guard, and Governor Wallace.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:23:21,650","00:23:25,360",<i>...because these National Guardsmen are here today</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:23:25,446","00:23:27,984",<i>as federal soldiers for Alabamans.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:23:28,073","00:23:31,987","<i>They live within our borders, they are all our brothers.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:23:32,077","00:23:34,490","<i>We are winning in this fight,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:23:34,580","00:23:37,573",<i>because we are awakening the American people</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:23:37,666","00:23:41,000","<i>to the dangers that we have spoken about so many times,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:23:41,086","00:23:47,378","<i>just so evident today, the trend towards military dictatorship in this country.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:23:50,846","00:23:53,304","<i>And so, at day's end, the University of Alabama</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:23:53,390","00:23:55,677",<i>in Tuscaloosa had been desegregated</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:23:55,768","00:23:58,761",<i>and students Jimmy Hood and Vivian Malone</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:23:58,854","00:24:01,938",<i>had been signed up for summer classes.</i>

Forrest.Gump,"00:24:13,577","00:24:15,694","Say, wasn't that Gump?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:24:15,788","00:24:19,873","- Nah, that couldn't be. - It sure as hell was."

Forrest.Gump,"00:24:26,548","00:24:29,040",<i>at the school house door thought it would be a good idea</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:24:29,134","00:24:31,296",<i>and ran for president.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:24:34,390","00:24:37,053",<i>But somebody thought that it wasn't.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:24:38,769","00:24:40,806",But he didn't die.
Forrest.Gump,"00:24:45,401","00:24:47,063",My bus is here.
Forrest.Gump,"00:24:47,778","00:24:50,896","- Is it the number nine? - No, it's the number four."
Forrest.Gump,"00:24:51,907","00:24:54,069",It was nice talking to you.
Forrest.Gump,"00:24:56,996","00:25:01,081","I remember when that happened, when Wallace got shot."
Forrest.Gump,"00:25:01,959","00:25:03,416",I was in college.
Forrest.Gump,"00:25:03,502","00:25:04,742","Did you go to a girls' college,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:25:04,795","00:25:06,627",or to a girls-and-boys-together college?
Forrest.Gump,"00:25:06,755","00:25:07,755",It was co-ed.
Forrest.Gump,"00:25:07,840","00:25:10,548",'Cause Jenny went to a college I couldn't go to.
Forrest.Gump,"00:25:10,634","00:25:12,967",It was a college just for girls.
Forrest.Gump,"00:25:13,095","00:25:16,259",<i>But I'd go and visit her every chance I got.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:25:46,962","00:25:48,373",That hurts.
Forrest.Gump,"00:25:59,391","00:26:01,553",Forrest! Forrest!
Forrest.Gump,"00:26:03,812","00:26:06,725","- Forrest, stop it! Stop it! - Jesus!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:26:06,815","00:26:07,931",What are you doing?
Forrest.Gump,"00:26:08,025","00:26:09,794",- He was hurting you. - What the hell is going on here?
Forrest.Gump,"00:26:09,818","00:26:13,482","- No, he's not! Get over there! - Who is that? Who is that?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:26:13,572","00:26:14,716","- Billy, I'm sorry. - What the hell?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:26:14,740","00:26:17,323",- Just get away from me! - Don't...
Forrest.Gump,"00:26:17,409","00:26:20,368","- Don't go! Billy, wait a second! - Get away from me."
Forrest.Gump,"00:26:20,496","00:26:22,658",He doesn't know any better!
Forrest.Gump,"00:26:24,416","00:26:27,079","Forrest, why did you do that?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:26:30,047","00:26:33,006",I brought you some chocolate.
Forrest.Gump,"00:26:33,383","00:26:35,090",I'm sorry.
Forrest.Gump,"00:26:37,262","00:26:40,551",- I'll go back to my college now. - Forrest...
Forrest.Gump,"00:26:44,269","00:26:45,851",Look at you.
Forrest.Gump,"00:26:47,940","00:26:50,023",Come on. Come on.
Forrest.Gump,"00:26:57,533","00:26:59,399",Is this your room?
Forrest.Gump,"00:27:03,872","00:27:06,114","Do you ever dream, Forrest,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:27:07,459","00:27:10,293",about who you're gonna be?
Forrest.Gump,"00:27:10,379","00:27:12,166",- Who I'm gonna be? - Yeah.
Forrest.Gump,"00:27:12,256","00:27:14,122",Aren't I going to be me?
Forrest.Gump,"00:27:14,216","00:27:17,880","Well, you'll always be you, just another kind of you."
Forrest.Gump,"00:27:18,804","00:27:22,047",You know? I want to be famous.
Forrest.Gump,"00:27:23,767","00:27:26,555",I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.
Forrest.Gump,"00:27:27,771","00:27:30,889",I just want to be on an empty stage
Forrest.Gump,"00:27:30,983","00:27:33,270","with my guitar, my voice."
Forrest.Gump,"00:27:35,112","00:27:36,569",Just me.
Forrest.Gump,"00:27:38,073","00:27:41,407",And I want to reach people on the personal level.
Forrest.Gump,"00:27:44,079","00:27:47,413","I want to be able to say things, just one-to-one."
Forrest.Gump,"00:27:54,923","00:27:57,791","Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:27:59,261","00:28:03,096",I sit next to them in my Home Economics class all the time.
Forrest.Gump,"00:28:32,044","00:28:34,457",- I'm... Sorry. - It's okay.
Forrest.Gump,"00:28:43,013","00:28:44,720",It's all right.
Forrest.Gump,"00:28:47,559","00:28:49,721","- It's okay. - Oh, I'm dizzy."
Forrest.Gump,"00:28:58,403","00:29:01,146",I bet that never happened in Home Ec.
Forrest.Gump,"00:29:05,994","00:29:07,155",No.
Forrest.Gump,"00:29:13,377","00:29:16,495",I think I ruined your roommate's bathrobe.
Forrest.Gump,"00:29:16,588","00:29:18,625","I don't care. I don't like her, anyway."
Forrest.Gump,"00:29:18,715","00:29:22,083",Run! Run! Run!
Forrest.Gump,"00:29:22,177","00:29:26,672",- Run! Run! Run! - Run! Run! Run!

Forrest.Gump,"00:30:03,719","00:30:07,178","<i>And since, number one, I wasn't hungry, but thirsty,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:30:07,264","00:30:09,927","<i>and number two, they was free,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:30:10,058","00:30:13,096",<i>I must have drank me about 15 Dr. Peppers.</i>

Forrest.Gump,"00:31:51,326","00:31:53,113",This seat's taken.
Forrest.Gump,"00:31:54,996","00:31:56,362",Taken.
Forrest.Gump,"00:31:59,292","00:32:02,080","<i>At first, it seemed like I made a mistake,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:32:02,170","00:32:04,207",<i>seeing how it was only my induction day</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:32:04,339","00:32:07,047",<i>and I was already getting yelled at.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:32:10,137","00:32:12,379",You can sit down if you want to.
Forrest.Gump,"00:32:12,514","00:32:16,349","<i>I didn't know who I might meet, or what they might ask.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:32:16,476","00:32:19,059",You ever been on a real shrimp boat?
Forrest.Gump,"00:32:19,563","00:32:23,182","No, but I been on a real big boat."
Forrest.Gump,"00:32:23,984","00:32:26,772",I'm talking about a shrimp-catching boat.
Forrest.Gump,"00:32:26,862","00:32:29,354",I've been working on shrimp boats all my life.
Forrest.Gump,"00:32:29,489","00:32:32,232","I started out on my uncle's boat, that's my mama's brother,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:32:32,367","00:32:34,404",when I was about maybe nine.
Forrest.Gump,"00:32:34,536","00:32:38,655",I was just looking into buying a boat of my own and got drafted.
Forrest.Gump,"00:32:39,499","00:32:44,369",My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue. People call me Bubba.
Forrest.Gump,"00:32:45,046","00:32:48,665",Just like one of them old redneck boys. Can you believe that?
Forrest.Gump,"00:32:48,758","00:32:52,422",My name's Forrest Gump. People call me Forrest Gump.
Forrest.Gump,"00:32:53,388","00:32:55,801","<i>So, Bubba was from Bayou La Batre, Alabama,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:32:55,891","00:32:57,803","<i>and his mama cooked shrimp,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:33:00,061","00:33:02,929","<i>and her mama before her cooked shrimp,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:33:03,064","00:33:06,023","<i>and her mama before her mama cooked shrimp, too.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:33:06,109","00:33:07,316",<i>Bubba's family knew everything</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:33:07,402","00:33:10,019",<i>there was to know about the shrimping business.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:33:10,113","00:33:13,151",I know everything there is to know about the shrimping business.
Forrest.Gump,"00:33:13,241","00:33:16,234","Matter of fact, I'm going into the shrimping business for myself"
Forrest.Gump,"00:33:16,369","00:33:18,702",after I get out the Army.
Forrest.Gump,"00:33:21,374","00:33:22,410",Okay.
Forrest.Gump,"00:33:22,626","00:33:26,711",Gump! What's your sole purpose in this Army?
Forrest.Gump,"00:33:26,796","00:33:29,334","To do whatever you tell me, Drill Sergeant!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:33:29,424","00:33:32,792","God damn it, Gump! You're a goddamn genius!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:33:32,928","00:33:35,261",That's the most outstanding answer I've ever heard.
Forrest.Gump,"00:33:35,388","00:33:38,131",You must have a goddamn IQ of 160!
Forrest.Gump,"00:33:38,266","00:33:41,225","You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:33:42,229","00:33:44,095","Listen up, people!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:33:44,231","00:33:48,396","<i>Now, for some reason, I fit in the Army like one of them round pegs.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:33:48,485","00:33:49,726",<i>It's not really hard.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:33:49,819","00:33:53,438","<i>You just make your bed real neat and remember to stand up straight,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:33:53,573","00:33:57,533","<i>and always answer every question with, ""Yes, Drill Sergeant!""</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:33:57,619","00:33:59,076",Is that clear?
Forrest.Gump,"00:33:59,162","00:34:01,279","- Yes, Drill Sergeant! - Yes, Drill Sergeant!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:34:01,790","00:34:05,079","What you do is, you just drag your nets along the bottom."
Forrest.Gump,"00:34:05,168","00:34:08,912","On a good day, you can catch over 100 pounds of shrimp."
Forrest.Gump,"00:34:09,005","00:34:12,419","If everything goes all right, two men shrimping 10 hours,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:34:12,509","00:34:15,217","less what you spend on gas, you can..."
Forrest.Gump,"00:34:15,303","00:34:18,091","- Done, Drill Sergeant! - Gump!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:34:20,475","00:34:23,218","Why did you put that weapon together so quickly, Gump?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:34:23,311","00:34:24,973","You told me to, Drill Sergeant."
Forrest.Gump,"00:34:25,105","00:34:28,519","Jesus H. Christ, this is a new company record."
Forrest.Gump,"00:34:28,650","00:34:31,108","If it wouldn't be a waste of such a damn fine enlisted man,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:34:31,194","00:34:33,481","I'd recommend you for OCS, Private Gump."
Forrest.Gump,"00:34:33,613","00:34:35,445","You are gonna be a general some day, Gump."
Forrest.Gump,"00:34:35,532","00:34:38,616","Now, disassemble your weapon and continue!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:34:40,704","00:34:44,493","Anyway, like I was saying, shrimp is the fruit of the sea."
Forrest.Gump,"00:34:44,583","00:34:49,328","You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it."
Forrest.Gump,"00:34:49,421","00:34:52,414","There's shrimp kebabs, shrimp Creole..."
Forrest.Gump,"00:34:52,716","00:34:57,552","...shrimp gumbo, pan fried, deep fried, stir fried."

Forrest.Gump,"00:35:15,864","00:35:18,197",That's... That's about it.
Forrest.Gump,"00:35:21,911","00:35:24,870",<i>Night time in the Army is a lonely time.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:35:25,749","00:35:29,368",<i>We'd lay there in our bunks and I'd miss my mama.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:35:29,961","00:35:32,453",<i>And I'd miss Jenny.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:35:36,384","00:35:40,253","Hey, Gump, get a load of the tits on her!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:35:53,735","00:35:56,853","<i>Turns out, Jenny had gotten into some trouble over</i>"

Forrest.Gump,"00:36:00,408","00:36:02,946",<i>and she was thrown out of school.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:36:06,498","00:36:08,706","<i>But that wasn't a bad thing,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:36:08,792","00:36:12,376","<i>because a man who owns a theater in Memphis, Tennessee,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:36:12,462","00:36:17,503",<i>saw those photos and offered Jenny a job singing in a show.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:36:18,301","00:36:20,133","<i>The first chance I got,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:36:20,261","00:36:23,925",<i>I took the bus up to Memphis to see her perform in that show.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:36:24,015","00:36:25,506","<i>That was Amber, Amber Flame.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:36:25,600","00:36:28,058","<i>Give her a big hand, guys. Good job, Amber.</i>"

Forrest.Gump,"00:43:43,871","00:43:46,033",Little Rock's a fine town.
Forrest.Gump,"00:43:46,707","00:43:50,291","Now, go shake down your gear, see the platoon sergeant,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:43:50,378","00:43:52,836",draw what you need for the field.
Forrest.Gump,"00:43:52,922","00:43:56,882","If you boys are hungry, we got steaks burning right over here."
Forrest.Gump,"00:43:56,968","00:43:59,836",Two standing orders in this platoon:
Forrest.Gump,"00:43:59,929","00:44:02,592","one, take good care of your feet,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:44:02,723","00:44:07,764","two, try not to do anything stupid, like getting yourself killed."
Forrest.Gump,"00:44:14,235","00:44:16,318",I sure hope I don't let him down.
Forrest.Gump,"00:44:27,915","00:44:32,831",<i>I got to see a lot of the countryside. We would take these real long walks.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:44:41,304","00:44:45,423",<i>And we were always looking for this guy named Charlie.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:44:53,274","00:44:55,516","- Hold it up! - Hold up, boys!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:44:58,362","00:45:00,695",<i>It wasn't always fun.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:45:00,781","00:45:05,071","<i>Lieutenant Dan was always getting these funny feelings about a rock,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:45:05,161","00:45:10,247","<i>or a trail, or the road, so he'd tell us to get down, shut up...</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:45:10,333","00:45:12,325",Get down! Shut up!
Forrest.Gump,"00:45:13,294","00:45:14,751",<i>...so we did.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:45:32,313","00:45:34,475","<i>Now, I don't know much about anything,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:45:34,565","00:45:38,400",<i>but I think some of America's best young men served in this war.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:45:38,486","00:45:41,194","<i>There was Dallas, from Phoenix,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:45:42,907","00:45:45,695","<i>Cleveland, he was from Detroit.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:45:45,826","00:45:48,193","Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex."
Forrest.Gump,"00:45:48,329","00:45:50,491","Man, what the hell's going on?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:45:50,581","00:45:54,916","<i>And Tex was... Well, I don't remember where Tex come from.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:45:55,002","00:45:56,538",Nothing.
Forrest.Gump,"00:46:00,675","00:46:03,167","Fourth Platoon, on your feet."
Forrest.Gump,"00:46:03,261","00:46:06,971",Still got 10 klicks to go to that river. Move out.
Forrest.Gump,"00:46:07,056","00:46:08,843","Come on, move out."
Forrest.Gump,"00:46:10,893","00:46:13,306",Step it up. Look alive out there.
Forrest.Gump,"00:46:13,396","00:46:17,731",<i>The good thing about Vietnam is there was always some place to go.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:46:17,858","00:46:19,224",Fire in the hole!
Forrest.Gump,"00:46:22,697","00:46:25,030","Gump, check out that hole."
Forrest.Gump,"00:46:25,116","00:46:28,109",<i>And there was always something to do.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:46:28,202","00:46:31,366",- Mount them up. - Spread out! Cover his back.
Forrest.Gump,"00:46:36,419","00:46:42,040","<i>One day, it started raining, and it didn't quit for four months.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:46:43,050","00:46:45,918",<i>We'd been through every kind of rain there is:</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:46:46,053","00:46:48,591","<i>little bitty stinging rain,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:46:49,307","00:46:51,970","<i>and big old fat rain,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:46:52,435","00:46:55,143",<i>rain that flew in sideways.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:46:55,229","00:46:59,269","<i>And sometimes, rain even seemed to come straight up from underneath.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:47:01,068","00:47:03,435","<i>Shoot, it even rained at night.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:47:04,488","00:47:06,946","- Hey, Forrest. - Hey, Bubba."
Forrest.Gump,"00:47:07,074","00:47:10,363",I'm gonna lean up against you. You just lean right back against me.
Forrest.Gump,"00:47:10,453","00:47:14,288","This way, we don't have to sleep with our heads in the mud."
Forrest.Gump,"00:47:15,249","00:47:18,708","You know why we a good partnership, Forrest?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:47:18,794","00:47:21,286","'Cause we be watching out for one another,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:47:21,422","00:47:23,288",like brothers and stuff.
Forrest.Gump,"00:47:25,259","00:47:28,923","Hey, Forrest, there's something I've been thinking about."
Forrest.Gump,"00:47:29,013","00:47:32,006",I got a very important question to ask you.
Forrest.Gump,"00:47:33,642","00:47:37,602",How would you like to go into the shrimping business with me?
Forrest.Gump,"00:47:38,773","00:47:40,389",Okay.
Forrest.Gump,"00:47:40,483","00:47:43,942","Man, I tell you what, I got it all figured out, too."
Forrest.Gump,"00:47:44,028","00:47:46,816","So many pounds of shrimp to pay off the boat,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:47:46,947","00:47:50,236","so many pounds for gas, we can just live right on the boat."
Forrest.Gump,"00:47:50,326","00:47:52,613",We ain't got to pay no rent.
Forrest.Gump,"00:47:52,703","00:47:54,786","I'll be the captain, we can just work it together,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:47:54,872","00:47:59,116","split everything right down the middle. Man, I'm telling you, 50-50."
Forrest.Gump,"00:47:59,210","00:48:02,794","And, hey, Forrest, all the shrimp you can eat."
Forrest.Gump,"00:48:04,340","00:48:06,127",That's a fine idea.
Forrest.Gump,"00:48:07,218","00:48:09,335",<i>Bubba did have a fine idea.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:48:13,140","00:48:16,224",<i>I even wrote Jenny and told her all about it.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:48:17,019","00:48:20,228","<i>I sent her letters, not every day, but almost.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:48:20,314","00:48:25,309","<i>I told her what I was doing and asked her what she was doing,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:48:25,403","00:48:28,146","<i>and told her how I thought about her always,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:48:29,490","00:48:32,449",<i>and how I was looking forward to getting a letter from her</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:48:32,535","00:48:35,027",<i>just as soon as she had the time.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:48:36,914","00:48:39,406",<i>I'd always let her know that I was okay.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:48:40,709","00:48:45,875","<i>Then, I'd sign each letter, ""Love, Forrest Gump.""</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:49:00,729","00:49:04,473","<i>This one day, we was out walking, like always,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:49:04,567","00:49:07,526","<i>and then, just like that,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:49:08,446","00:49:11,860",<i>somebody turned off the rain and the sun come out.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:49:14,869","00:49:16,701",Ambush!
Forrest.Gump,"00:49:17,204","00:49:18,570",Take cover!
Forrest.Gump,"00:49:22,209","00:49:23,370",Get down!
Forrest.Gump,"00:49:23,461","00:49:24,918",Get the sixty!
Forrest.Gump,"00:49:28,090","00:49:30,173","Get that pig up here, God damn it!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:49:30,259","00:49:32,376","Forrest, you okay?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:49:35,598","00:49:38,215","Strongarm! Strongarm! Be advised, Strongarm!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:49:38,767","00:49:41,180","Medic, we got a man down!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:49:41,270","00:49:44,229","Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:49:44,940","00:49:48,274","Roger, Strongarm, be advised we have incoming from the tree line"
Forrest.Gump,"00:49:48,402","00:49:51,895",at points blue plus two. AKs and rockets...
Forrest.Gump,"00:49:52,573","00:49:54,360",Misfire! Misfire!
Forrest.Gump,"00:49:56,744","00:49:58,736",God damn it! Mac!
Forrest.Gump,"00:49:59,705","00:50:03,119","Get that thing... Fuck it, get it in the tree line!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:50:04,084","00:50:05,245",Jesus!
Forrest.Gump,"00:50:05,377","00:50:07,585",My unit is down hard and hurting!
Forrest.Gump,"00:50:07,713","00:50:11,252","Six are pulling back to Blue Line, Leg Lima 6 out."
Forrest.Gump,"00:50:12,051","00:50:14,008",Pull back! Pull back!
Forrest.Gump,"00:50:14,094","00:50:16,211","Run! Run, Forrest!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:50:16,305","00:50:18,638","- Pull back! - Forrest, Forrest!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:50:18,766","00:50:21,349","Run, man! Run!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:50:21,435","00:50:23,222",Pull back! Run!
Forrest.Gump,"00:50:25,064","00:50:27,272","Run, God damn it, run!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:50:48,462","00:50:53,082",Medic! Can I get a medic?
Forrest.Gump,"00:50:53,467","00:50:56,801","<i>I ran and ran, just like Jenny told me to.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:51:00,182","00:51:04,392","<i>I ran so far and so fast that pretty soon I was all by myself,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:51:04,478","00:51:06,435",<i>which was a bad thing.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:51:06,981","00:51:08,517",Bubba!
Forrest.Gump,"00:51:10,651","00:51:14,440",<i>Bubba was my best good friend. I had to make sure that he was okay.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:51:18,158","00:51:20,195",Any friendlies out there?
Forrest.Gump,"00:51:21,161","00:51:23,323","Yeah, I've got three over here."
Forrest.Gump,"00:51:23,956","00:51:25,948",Where the hell are you?
Forrest.Gump,"00:51:26,542","00:51:27,874",Bubba?
Forrest.Gump,"00:51:28,961","00:51:31,669","<i>And on my way back to find Bubba,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:51:31,797","00:51:34,585","<i>well, there was this boy laying on the ground.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:51:34,675","00:51:35,882",Tex!
Forrest.Gump,"00:51:37,970","00:51:38,970",Okay.
Forrest.Gump,"00:51:39,054","00:51:43,014","<i>I couldn't just let him lay there all alone, scared the way he was,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:51:43,142","00:51:47,011",<i>so I grabbed him up and run him out of there.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:52:02,161","00:52:04,574","<i>And every time I went back looking for Bubba,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:52:04,705","00:52:08,198","<i>somebody else was saying, ""Help me, Forrest. Help me.""</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:52:15,883","00:52:17,749",Can't hear... Can't hear...
Forrest.Gump,"00:52:20,054","00:52:21,340","No sweat, man. Just lay back."
Forrest.Gump,"00:52:21,430","00:52:23,922",You'll be okay. You'll be okay.
Forrest.Gump,"00:52:25,934","00:52:28,972",<i>I started to get scared that I might never find Bubba.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:52:29,063","00:52:30,304",<i>...over.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:52:30,397","00:52:33,686","Roger, Strongarm, I know my position is danger close."
Forrest.Gump,"00:52:33,776","00:52:35,608",We got Charlie all over this area.
Forrest.Gump,"00:52:35,736","00:52:38,023",I gotta have those fast movers in here now. Over.
Forrest.Gump,"00:52:38,113","00:52:41,481","<i>- Six, Strongarm, we want...</i> - Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:52:41,575","00:52:42,782",I know he's dead!
Forrest.Gump,"00:52:42,910","00:52:45,744",My whole goddamn platoon is wiped out!
Forrest.Gump,"00:52:45,871","00:52:47,265","<i>- Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6.</i> - God damn it!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:52:47,289","00:52:49,997",<i>- Copy this transmission. Over.</i> - What are you doing?
Forrest.Gump,"00:52:50,084","00:52:53,418",Just leave me here! Get away. Just leave me here! Get out!
Forrest.Gump,"00:52:53,545","00:52:55,832","<i>Leg Lima 6, Strongarm. How copy this? Over.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:52:55,923","00:52:58,540","God, I said leave me here, God damn it!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:52:58,634","00:53:01,798","<i>Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6, this is Strongarm, be advised</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:53:01,929","00:53:03,886","<i>your fast movers are inbound at this time, over.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:53:03,972","00:53:07,386","<i>Then, it felt like something just jumped up and bit me.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:53:08,268","00:53:09,930",Something bit me!
Forrest.Gump,"00:53:16,819","00:53:18,936",You chink son of a bitch!
Forrest.Gump,"00:53:21,448","00:53:23,440",I can't leave the platoon.
Forrest.Gump,"00:53:23,575","00:53:28,491","I told you to leave me there, Gump. Forget about me. Get yourself out!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:53:28,622","00:53:30,739",Did you hear what I said?
Forrest.Gump,"00:53:31,458","00:53:33,415","God damn it, put me down!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:53:34,128","00:53:36,165",Get your ass out of here!
Forrest.Gump,"00:53:39,466","00:53:42,049","I didn't ask you to pull me out of there, God damn you!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:53:42,136","00:53:43,571",Where the hell do you think you're going?
Forrest.Gump,"00:53:43,595","00:53:44,676",To get Bubba.
Forrest.Gump,"00:53:44,805","00:53:48,640",I got an air strike inbound right now. They're gonna nape the whole area.
Forrest.Gump,"00:53:48,767","00:53:51,134","Gump, you stay here, God damn it! That's an order!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:53:51,270","00:53:53,683",I gotta find Bubba!
Forrest.Gump,"00:54:09,663","00:54:11,120",Forrest.
Forrest.Gump,"00:54:18,881","00:54:21,544","- Bubba. - I'm okay, Forrest."
Forrest.Gump,"00:54:22,342","00:54:24,004",I'm okay.
Forrest.Gump,"00:54:31,852","00:54:33,684","Oh, Bubba, no..."
Forrest.Gump,"00:54:33,812","00:54:36,020","Nah, I'm gonna be all right."
Forrest.Gump,"00:54:44,198","00:54:46,861",Come on. Come on. Come on.
Forrest.Gump,"00:54:51,872","00:54:53,363","I'm okay, Forrest."
Forrest.Gump,"00:54:54,708","00:54:57,542","I'm okay, man. I'm fine."
Forrest.Gump,"00:55:34,581","00:55:37,699","Helo's inbound. Top smoke, get it out there!"
Forrest.Gump,"00:55:38,752","00:55:43,247","<i>If I'd a known this was gonna be the last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:55:43,382","00:55:45,669",<i>I'd of thought of something better to say.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:55:45,759","00:55:47,250","Hey, Bubba."
Forrest.Gump,"00:55:48,387","00:55:49,753","Hey, Forrest."
Forrest.Gump,"00:55:52,099","00:55:55,308","Forrest, why'd this happen?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:55:56,645","00:55:58,432",You got shot.
Forrest.Gump,"00:56:00,148","00:56:04,313",<i>Then Bubba said something I won't ever forget.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:56:05,112","00:56:06,774",I wanna go home.
Forrest.Gump,"00:56:08,782","00:56:10,819",<i>Bubba was my best good friend.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:56:11,785","00:56:16,325",<i>And even I know that ain't something you can find just around the corner.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:56:16,456","00:56:19,540","<i>Bubba was gonna be a shrimping boat captain,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:56:19,626","00:56:23,586",<i>but instead he died right there by that river in Vietnam.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:56:29,303","00:56:31,590",That's all I have to say about that.
Forrest.Gump,"00:56:33,974","00:56:36,136","It was a bullet, wasn't it?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:56:38,478","00:56:41,141",- A bullet? - That jumped up and bit you.
Forrest.Gump,"00:56:43,525","00:56:45,608","Oh, yes, sir."
Forrest.Gump,"00:56:45,694","00:56:48,812",Bit me directly in the buttocks.
Forrest.Gump,"00:56:48,947","00:56:54,193","They said it was a million-dollar wound, but the Army must keep that money,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:56:54,328","00:56:58,163",'cause I still ain't seen a nickel of that million dollars.
Forrest.Gump,"00:56:58,999","00:57:02,492",The only good thing about being wounded in the buttocks
Forrest.Gump,"00:57:02,628","00:57:04,335",<i>is the ice cream.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:57:04,463","00:57:07,046",<i>They gave me all the ice cream I could eat.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:57:07,174","00:57:08,460",<i>And guess what?</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:57:08,550","00:57:11,668",<i>A good friend of mine was in the bed right next door.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:57:13,889","00:57:16,973","Lieutenant Dan, I got you some ice cream."
Forrest.Gump,"00:57:19,353","00:57:21,515","Lieutenant Dan, ice cream."
Forrest.Gump,"00:57:33,241","00:57:35,528","It's time for your bath, Lieutenant."
Forrest.Gump,"00:57:44,044","00:57:45,376",Harper!
Forrest.Gump,"00:57:48,590","00:57:51,048","Cooper, Larson,"

Forrest.Gump,"00:58:24,001","00:58:26,243","<i>Surprise, surprise, surprise!</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:58:29,589","00:58:32,081","Gump, how can you watch that stupid shit?"
Forrest.Gump,"00:58:32,175","00:58:33,820",<i>- From the DMZ to the Delta...</i> - Turn it off!
Forrest.Gump,"00:58:33,844","00:58:37,087",<i>...you are tuned to the American Forces Vietnam Network.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:58:37,222","00:58:39,555","<i>This is Channel 6, Saigon.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:58:42,269","00:58:43,931","Good catch, Gump."
Forrest.Gump,"00:58:45,897","00:58:48,059",You know how to play this?
Forrest.Gump,"00:58:49,359","00:58:51,442","Come on, let me show you. Here."
Forrest.Gump,"00:58:53,530","00:58:55,863","Now, the secret to this game is,"
Forrest.Gump,"00:58:55,949","00:59:01,786","no matter what happens, never ever take your eye off the ball."
Forrest.Gump,"00:59:05,375","00:59:06,707",All right.
Forrest.Gump,"00:59:10,047","00:59:13,711","<i>For some reason, Ping-Pong came very natural to me.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:59:14,051","00:59:16,964",See? Any idiot can play.
Forrest.Gump,"00:59:17,471","00:59:20,214","<i>So, I started playing it all the time.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:59:21,391","00:59:22,723",<i>I played Ping-Pong</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:59:22,809","00:59:26,098",<i>even when I didn't have anyone to play Ping-Pong with.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:59:34,154","00:59:38,819","<i>The hospital's people said it made me look like a duck in water,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"00:59:38,950","00:59:40,782",<i>whatever that means.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:59:41,244","00:59:44,487",<i>Even Lieutenant Dan would come and watch me play.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"00:59:50,003","00:59:53,872","<i>I played Ping-Pong so much, I even played it in my sleep.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:00:01,681","01:00:06,767","Now, you listen to me. We all have a destiny."
Forrest.Gump,"01:00:06,853","01:00:09,891","Nothing just happens, it's all part of a plan."
Forrest.Gump,"01:00:10,023","01:00:12,686","I should have died out there with my men,"
Forrest.Gump,"01:00:12,818","01:00:16,778","but now I'm nothing but a goddamn cripple,"
Forrest.Gump,"01:00:16,863","01:00:20,482",a legless freak! Look! Look! Look at me!
Forrest.Gump,"01:00:21,243","01:00:22,324",Do you see that?
Forrest.Gump,"01:00:22,410","01:00:26,199",Do you know what it's like not to be able to use your legs?
Forrest.Gump,"01:00:29,543","01:00:31,159","Yes, sir, I do."
Forrest.Gump,"01:00:34,840","01:00:36,877",Did you hear what I said?
Forrest.Gump,"01:00:37,759","01:00:39,500",You cheated me.
Forrest.Gump,"01:00:39,594","01:00:40,755",I had a destiny.
Forrest.Gump,"01:00:40,846","01:00:44,385","I was supposed to die in the field, with honor!"
Forrest.Gump,"01:00:45,058","01:00:49,098","That was my destiny, and you cheated me out of it!"
Forrest.Gump,"01:00:58,738","01:01:01,446","Do you understand what I'm saying, Gump?"
Forrest.Gump,"01:01:03,577","01:01:06,945","This wasn't supposed to happen, not to me."
Forrest.Gump,"01:01:09,583","01:01:11,245",I had a destiny.
Forrest.Gump,"01:01:13,211","01:01:17,581",I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Forrest.Gump,"01:01:23,763","01:01:26,096",You're still Lieutenant Dan.
Forrest.Gump,"01:01:49,331","01:01:50,822",Look at me.
Forrest.Gump,"01:01:52,167","01:01:54,124",What am I gonna do now?
Forrest.Gump,"01:01:57,797","01:01:59,834",What am I gonna do now?
Forrest.Gump,"01:02:10,227","01:02:11,684",PFC Gump?
Forrest.Gump,"01:02:13,230","01:02:14,641","Yes, sir!"
Forrest.Gump,"01:02:15,315","01:02:16,806",As you were.
Forrest.Gump,"01:02:17,317","01:02:21,152","Son, you've been awarded the Medal of Honor."
Forrest.Gump,"01:02:22,197","01:02:25,816","Guess what, Lieutenant Dan, they want to give me a..."
Forrest.Gump,"01:02:32,582","01:02:36,326","Ma'am, what'd they do with Lieutenant Dan?"
Forrest.Gump,"01:02:37,254","01:02:39,041",They sent him home.
Forrest.Gump,"01:02:45,053","01:02:47,796","<i>Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:02:48,848","01:02:52,387",<i>The ceremony was kicked off with a candid speech by the President</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:02:52,477","01:02:55,845",<i>regarding the need for further escalation of the war in Vietnam.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:02:55,939","01:02:58,056",<i>President Johnson awarded four Medals of Honor</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:02:58,149","01:02:59,811",<i>to men from each of the Armed Services.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:02:59,901","01:03:02,814","<i>America owes you a debt of gratitude, son.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:03:04,823","01:03:08,612",<i>I understand you were wounded. Where were you hit?</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:03:08,702","01:03:11,866","<i>- In the buttocks, sir. - That must be a sight.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:03:12,622","01:03:14,909",<i>I'd kind of like to see that.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:03:29,055","01:03:30,512","<i>God damn, son.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:03:32,642","01:03:36,477","<i>After that, Mama went to the hotel to lay down,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:03:36,563","01:03:40,056",<i>so I went out for a walk to see our nation's capital.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:03:40,150","01:03:43,268","Hilary, all right, I've got the vets, what do you want me to do with them?"
Forrest.Gump,"01:03:43,361","01:03:45,102",What are you doing here so late?
Forrest.Gump,"01:03:45,196","01:03:49,236","<i>It's a good thing Mama was resting, 'cause the streets was awful crowded</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:03:49,326","01:03:52,490","<i>with people looking at all the statues and monuments,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:03:52,579","01:03:55,196",<i>and some of them people were loud and pushy.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:03:55,290","01:03:58,249","Okay, follow me! Come on. Let's move it out."
Forrest.Gump,"01:03:59,085","01:04:02,044","<i>Everywhere I went, I had to stand in line.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:04:05,300","01:04:06,836","Follow me, let's go!"
Forrest.Gump,"01:04:08,636","01:04:10,252",Come on. Let's go.
Forrest.Gump,"01:04:16,311","01:04:17,893",Stand here.
Forrest.Gump,"01:04:20,357","01:04:23,521","Hey, you're a good man for doing this. Good!"
Forrest.Gump,"01:04:24,819","01:04:25,935",Okay.
Forrest.Gump,"01:04:26,738","01:04:30,106",<i>There was this man giving a little talk.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:04:30,200","01:04:33,693","<i>And for some reason, he was wearing an American flag for a shirt.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:04:33,787","01:04:35,306","<i>Now, I'm gonna bring up some soldiers...</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:04:35,330","01:04:38,118","<i>And he liked to say the ""F"" word.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:04:38,208","01:04:41,576","<i>A lot.""F"" this and ""F"" that.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:04:41,669","01:04:44,002","<i>And every time he said the ""F"" word,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:04:44,089","01:04:46,832","<i>people, for some reason, well, they'd cheer.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:04:46,925","01:04:50,009",<i>...where to stick this fucking war! Yeah!</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:04:51,054","01:04:53,387",<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:04:53,973","01:04:56,465","Come on, man, come up here, man."
Forrest.Gump,"01:04:56,893","01:05:00,227","Come on. Come on. Yeah, you! Come on. Move, move, move."
Forrest.Gump,"01:05:01,231","01:05:04,645",You can do it. Just get up there. Go on. That's it.
Forrest.Gump,"01:05:17,455","01:05:19,993","<i>Tell us a little bit about the war, man.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:05:20,083","01:05:21,824",<i>The war in Vietnam?</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:05:21,918","01:05:24,831",<i>- The war in Viet-fucking-nam!</i> - Yeah!
Forrest.Gump,"01:05:45,191","01:05:46,272",Peace!
Forrest.Gump,"01:05:46,651","01:05:48,017","Come on, man, go!"
Forrest.Gump,"01:05:48,319","01:05:50,276",- Come on! - Peace!
Forrest.Gump,"01:05:50,363","01:05:51,399",<i>Well...</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:05:51,489","01:05:54,948",<i>There was only one thing I could say about the war in Vietnam.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:05:55,034","01:05:59,870",<i>...there's only one thing I can say about the war in Vietnam.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:06:03,668","01:06:07,457","<i>In Vietnam, your...</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:06:17,223","01:06:18,367","Hey, what the hell are you..."
Forrest.Gump,"01:06:18,391","01:06:21,134","I'll beat your head in, you goddamn oinker!"
Forrest.Gump,"01:06:21,227","01:06:23,719","Jesus Christ, what'd they do with this?"
Forrest.Gump,"01:06:25,148","01:06:26,810",We can't hear you!
Forrest.Gump,"01:06:28,526","01:06:30,518",We can't hear anything!
Forrest.Gump,"01:06:31,237","01:06:33,729",- This one! This one! Give me that! - Turn it up!
Forrest.Gump,"01:06:33,823","01:06:35,234",Speak up!
Forrest.Gump,"01:06:36,034","01:06:37,491",That's it!
Forrest.Gump,"01:06:38,578","01:06:41,412",<i>...and that's all I have to say about that.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:06:48,713","01:06:51,672","That's so right on, man. You said it all."
Forrest.Gump,"01:06:53,176","01:06:55,668","What's your name, man?"
Forrest.Gump,"01:06:55,762","01:06:58,379",<i>My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:06:59,599","01:07:00,760",<i>Forrest Gump!</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:07:00,892","01:07:02,258",- Gump! - Gump!
Forrest.Gump,"01:07:03,770","01:07:07,514",Forrest! Forrest!
Forrest.Gump,"01:07:11,569","01:07:13,936",<i>- Jenny!</i> - Forrest!
Forrest.Gump,"01:07:30,713","01:07:33,376",Hey! Hey!
Forrest.Gump,"01:07:41,474","01:07:44,592",<i>It was the happiest moment of my life.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:07:46,938","01:07:50,306",<i>Jenny and me were just like peas and carrots again.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:07:51,651","01:07:53,233","<i>She showed me around,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:07:53,319","01:07:55,902",<i>and even introduced me to some of her new friends.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:07:55,989","01:07:57,321","Shut that blind, man."
Forrest.Gump,"01:07:57,448","01:07:59,656",And get your white ass away from that window.
Forrest.Gump,"01:07:59,742","01:08:01,825",Don't you know we in a war here?
Forrest.Gump,"01:08:02,662","01:08:04,139","Hey, man, he's cool. He's cool. He's one of us."
Forrest.Gump,"01:08:04,163","01:08:06,141",- Let me tell you about us. - Where the hell have you been?
Forrest.Gump,"01:08:06,165","01:08:08,248",Our purpose here is to protect our black leaders
Forrest.Gump,"01:08:08,334","01:08:10,075",from the racial onslaught of the pig
Forrest.Gump,"01:08:10,169","01:08:12,252","who wishes to brutalize our black leaders,"
Forrest.Gump,"01:08:12,338","01:08:15,672","rape our women, and destroy our black communities."
Forrest.Gump,"01:08:18,595","01:08:20,507",Who's the baby killer?
Forrest.Gump,"01:08:20,638","01:08:23,346",This is my good friend I told you about. This is Forrest Gump.
Forrest.Gump,"01:08:23,433","01:08:25,174","Forrest, this is Wesley."
Forrest.Gump,"01:08:25,268","01:08:26,620","Wesley and I lived together in Berkeley,"
Forrest.Gump,"01:08:26,644","01:08:29,261",and he's the president of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.
Forrest.Gump,"01:08:29,355","01:08:30,766",Let me tell you something else.
Forrest.Gump,"01:08:30,857","01:08:35,101","We are here to offer protection and help for all of those who need our help,"
Forrest.Gump,"01:08:35,194","01:08:38,778","because we, the Black Panthers, are against the war in Vietnam."
Forrest.Gump,"01:08:38,865","01:08:42,529","Yes, we are against any war where black soldiers are sent to the frontline"
Forrest.Gump,"01:08:42,619","01:08:44,531",to die for a country that hates them.
Forrest.Gump,"01:08:44,621","01:08:47,785","Yes, we are against any war where black soldiers go to fight"
Forrest.Gump,"01:08:47,874","01:08:50,958",and come to be brutalized and killed in their own communities
Forrest.Gump,"01:08:51,044","01:08:52,626",as they sleep in their beds at night.
Forrest.Gump,"01:08:52,712","01:08:53,873",You are a fucking asshole!
Forrest.Gump,"01:08:53,963","01:08:57,331","Yes, we are against all these racist and imperial dog acts."
Forrest.Gump,"01:09:06,643","01:09:09,852",Forrest! Quit it! Quit it!
Forrest.Gump,"01:09:11,814","01:09:13,055",Forrest!
Forrest.Gump,"01:09:13,650","01:09:15,391",Stop it! Stop it!
Forrest.Gump,"01:09:22,033","01:09:23,399","Oh, God..."
Forrest.Gump,"01:09:24,243","01:09:26,656",I shouldn't have brought you here.
Forrest.Gump,"01:09:26,746","01:09:30,365",I should have known it was just gonna be some bullshit hassle.
Forrest.Gump,"01:09:31,542","01:09:34,159","He should not be hitting you, Jenny."
Forrest.Gump,"01:09:39,092","01:09:40,833","Come on, Forrest."
Forrest.Gump,"01:09:46,557","01:09:50,551",Sorry I had a fight in the middle of your Black Panther party.
Forrest.Gump,"01:09:53,439","01:09:55,834",He doesn't mean it when he does things like this. He doesn't.
Forrest.Gump,"01:09:55,858","01:09:58,191","I would never hurt you, Jenny."
Forrest.Gump,"01:10:00,029","01:10:02,271","I know you wouldn't, Forrest."
Forrest.Gump,"01:10:04,200","01:10:06,783",I wanted to be your boyfriend.
Forrest.Gump,"01:10:17,296","01:10:19,709","That uniform is a trip, Forrest."
Forrest.Gump,"01:10:21,092","01:10:24,301",You look handsome in it. You do.
Forrest.Gump,"01:10:28,391","01:10:30,303",- You know what? - What?
Forrest.Gump,"01:10:33,938","01:10:37,557",I'm glad we were here together in our nation's capital.
Forrest.Gump,"01:10:39,152","01:10:40,893","Me, too, Forrest."
Forrest.Gump,"01:10:40,987","01:10:45,652","<i>We walked around all night, Jenny and me, just talking.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:10:47,744","01:10:50,908",<i>She told me about all the traveling she'd done.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:10:50,997","01:10:55,583",<i>And how she'd discovered ways to expand her mind</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:10:55,668","01:10:58,752","<i>and learn how to live in harmony,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:10:58,838","01:11:01,171","<i>which must be out west somewhere,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:11:01,257","01:11:03,590",<i>'cause she made it all the way to California.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:11:03,676","01:11:05,918",<i>Try to love one another right now</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:11:06,012","01:11:07,173",Hey!
Forrest.Gump,"01:11:08,139","01:11:10,677",Anybody want to go to San Francisco?
Forrest.Gump,"01:11:10,767","01:11:12,633",- I'll go. - Far out.
Forrest.Gump,"01:11:14,103","01:11:17,267",<i>It was a very special night for the two of us.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:11:18,858","01:11:20,941",<i>I didn't want it to end.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:11:21,652","01:11:24,144","I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny."
Forrest.Gump,"01:11:25,156","01:11:26,943","I have to, Forrest."
Forrest.Gump,"01:11:27,950","01:11:29,191",Jenny?
Forrest.Gump,"01:11:31,370","01:11:33,953",Things got a little out of hand.
Forrest.Gump,"01:11:34,040","01:11:37,875","It's just this war and that lying son of a bitch, Johnson!"
Forrest.Gump,"01:11:39,545","01:11:42,333","I would never hurt you, you know that."
Forrest.Gump,"01:11:45,468","01:11:47,460",You know what I think?
Forrest.Gump,"01:11:48,971","01:11:54,217","I think you should go home to Greenbow, Alabama!"
Forrest.Gump,"01:12:04,737","01:12:09,823","Forrest, we have very different lives, you know."
Forrest.Gump,"01:12:19,252","01:12:22,416",I want you to have this.
Forrest.Gump,"01:12:27,093","01:12:29,255","Forrest, I can't keep this."
Forrest.Gump,"01:12:30,930","01:12:35,174",I got it just by doing what you told me to do.
Forrest.Gump,"01:12:37,228","01:12:39,390",Why are you so good to me?
Forrest.Gump,"01:12:40,898","01:12:42,434",You're my girl.
Forrest.Gump,"01:12:44,443","01:12:46,560",I'll always be your girl.
Forrest.Gump,"01:13:26,986","01:13:31,822","<i>And just like that, she was gone, out of my life again.</i>"

Forrest.Gump,"01:13:48,799","01:13:52,008","<i>but instead, they decided the best way for me to fight the Communists</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:13:52,094","01:13:53,710",<i>was to play Ping-Pong.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:13:53,804","01:13:56,091","<i>So, I was in the Special Services,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:13:56,182","01:13:59,425",<i>traveling around the country cheering up all them wounded veterans</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:13:59,518","01:14:01,931",and showing them how to play Ping-Pong.
Forrest.Gump,"01:14:02,021","01:14:03,933",I was so good that some years later

Forrest.Gump,"01:19:09,995","01:19:13,409",He'd be the captain of the shrimping boat and I'd be his first mate.

Forrest.Gump,"01:26:46,326","01:26:48,818",- You look real good. <i>- It's funny how things work out.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:26:48,954","01:26:52,072","<i>I didn't stay home for long, because I'd made a promise to Bubba,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:26:52,165","01:26:54,407",<i>and I always try to keep my promise.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:26:54,501","01:26:56,037","<i>So, I went on down to Bayou La Batre</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:26:56,128","01:26:59,872",<i>to meet Bubba's family and make their introduction.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:26:59,965","01:27:03,629","Are you crazy, or just plain stupid?"
Forrest.Gump,"01:27:04,344","01:27:06,586","Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue."
Forrest.Gump,"01:27:06,680","01:27:08,046",I guess.
Forrest.Gump,"01:27:09,057","01:27:12,641","<i>And, of course, I paid my respect to Bubba himself.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:27:14,646","01:27:17,184","Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump."
Forrest.Gump,"01:27:20,318","01:27:24,358","I remember everything you said, and I got it all figured out."
Forrest.Gump,"01:27:27,159","01:27:33,952","I'm taking the $24,562 and 47 cents that I got..."
Forrest.Gump,"01:27:35,041","01:27:38,625","<i>Or, that's left after a new hair cut and a new suit,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:27:38,712","01:27:40,669","<i>and I took Mama out to a real fancy dinner,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:27:40,756","01:27:43,999",<i>and I bought a bus ticket and three Dr. Peppers.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:27:44,551","01:27:46,338",Tell me something.
Forrest.Gump,"01:27:47,387","01:27:49,504",Are you stupid or something?
Forrest.Gump,"01:27:49,598","01:27:51,635","Stupid is as stupid does, sir."
Forrest.Gump,"01:27:51,725","01:27:54,684","Well, that's what's left after me saying,"
Forrest.Gump,"01:27:55,604","01:27:57,764","""When I was in China on the All-America Ping-Pong team,"
Forrest.Gump,"01:27:57,856","01:28:01,645","""I just loved playing Ping-Pong with my Flex-O-Light Ping-Pong paddle,"""
Forrest.Gump,"01:28:01,735","01:28:03,045","which everybody knows isn't true,"
Forrest.Gump,"01:28:03,069","01:28:04,505",but Mama says it's just a little white lie
Forrest.Gump,"01:28:04,529","01:28:06,691",so it wouldn't hurt nobody.
Forrest.Gump,"01:28:08,116","01:28:14,033","So, anyway, I'm putting all that on gas, ropes and new nets"
Forrest.Gump,"01:28:14,790","01:28:16,531",and a brand-new shrimping boat.
Forrest.Gump,"01:28:38,230","01:28:41,473","<i>Now, Bubba had told me everything he knew about shrimping,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:28:41,566","01:28:43,899",<i>but you know what I found out?</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:28:45,570","01:28:47,903",<i>Shrimping is tough.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:28:50,116","01:28:51,948",I only caught five.
Forrest.Gump,"01:28:52,077","01:28:55,411","A couple more, you could have yourself a cocktail."
Forrest.Gump,"01:28:58,750","01:29:00,561","Hey, you ever think about naming this old boat?"
Forrest.Gump,"01:29:00,585","01:29:03,248",It's bad luck to have a boat without a name.
Forrest.Gump,"01:29:05,632","01:29:10,468","<i>I'd never named a boat before, but there was only one I could think of,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:29:11,638","01:29:14,847",<i>the most beautiful name in the wide world.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:29:35,871","01:29:38,705","<i>Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny in a long while,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:29:38,790","01:29:41,328","<i>but I thought about her a lot,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:29:41,459","01:29:44,918",<i>and I hoped that whatever she was doing made her happy.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:31:31,194","01:31:33,732",<i>I thought about Jenny all the time.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:31:58,388","01:31:59,549",Hey!
Forrest.Gump,"01:32:23,413","01:32:28,078","Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing here?"
Forrest.Gump,"01:32:28,168","01:32:32,082","Well, thought I'd try out my sea legs."
Forrest.Gump,"01:32:32,172","01:32:35,916","But you ain't got no legs, Lieutenant Dan."
Forrest.Gump,"01:32:36,009","01:32:38,296","Yes, I know that."
Forrest.Gump,"01:32:38,636","01:32:40,673","You wrote me a letter, you idiot."
Forrest.Gump,"01:32:40,805","01:32:45,345","Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump. I had to see this for myself."
Forrest.Gump,"01:32:46,978","01:32:53,851",And I told you if you were ever a shrimp boat captain
Forrest.Gump,"01:32:53,985","01:32:56,568","that I'd be your first mate. Well, here I am."
Forrest.Gump,"01:32:56,654","01:32:59,772",- I am a man of my word. - Okay.
Forrest.Gump,"01:32:59,866","01:33:03,860","Yeah, but don't you be thinking that I'm going to be calling you ""sir."""
Forrest.Gump,"01:33:03,995","01:33:05,327","No, sir."
Forrest.Gump,"01:33:14,214","01:33:16,501",That's my boat.
Forrest.Gump,"01:33:19,094","01:33:24,556","I have a feeling if we head due east, we'll find some shrimp,"
Forrest.Gump,"01:33:24,682","01:33:26,264",so take a left.
Forrest.Gump,"01:33:27,685","01:33:30,598",- Take a left! - Which way?
Forrest.Gump,"01:33:30,688","01:33:33,351",Over there! They're over there!
Forrest.Gump,"01:33:34,025","01:33:37,860",- Get on the wheel and take a left! - Okay.
Forrest.Gump,"01:33:39,072","01:33:43,191","Gump, what are you doing? Take a left! Left!"
Forrest.Gump,"01:33:45,578","01:33:49,197","That's where we're going to find those shrimp, my boy!"
Forrest.Gump,"01:33:50,792","01:33:52,374",That's where we'll find them.
Forrest.Gump,"01:34:05,056","01:34:09,175","- Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan. - Okay, so I was wrong."
Forrest.Gump,"01:34:09,894","01:34:13,103",How are we going to find them?
Forrest.Gump,"01:34:13,231","01:34:15,723","Well, maybe you should just pray for shrimp."
Forrest.Gump,"01:34:22,365","01:34:25,028","<i>So, I went to church every Sunday.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:34:26,286","01:34:28,278","<i>Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:34:28,413","01:34:31,406",<i>though I think he left the praying up to me.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:34:46,890","01:34:51,260",- No shrimp. - Where the hell's this God of yours?
Forrest.Gump,"01:34:52,103","01:34:57,815","<i>It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that, 'cause right then, God showed up.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:35:14,667","01:35:19,503","- You'll never sink this boat! <i>- Now, me, I was scared,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:35:19,631","01:35:22,669","<i>but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:35:22,800","01:35:24,132",Come on!
Forrest.Gump,"01:35:27,263","01:35:32,475","You call this a storm? Come on, you son of a bitch!"
Forrest.Gump,"01:35:34,604","01:35:38,974",It's time for a showdown! You and me!
Forrest.Gump,"01:35:39,108","01:35:42,977",I'm right here! Come and get me!
Forrest.Gump,"01:35:44,781","01:35:48,650",You'll never sink this boat!
Forrest.Gump,"01:35:50,703","01:35:52,865","<i>Hurricane Carmen came through here yesterday,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:35:52,997","01:35:55,535",<i>destroying nearly everything in its path.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:35:55,667","01:35:58,159","<i>And as in other towns up and down the coast,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:35:58,336","01:36:00,703",<i>Bayou La Batre's entire shrimping industry</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:36:00,797","01:36:04,666",<i>has fallen victim to Carmen and has been left in utter ruin.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:36:04,801","01:36:07,919","<i>Speaking with local officials, this reporter has learned,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:36:08,012","01:36:11,471","<i>in fact, only one shrimping boat actually survived the storm.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:36:11,849","01:36:14,466","Louise. Louise, there's Forrest."
Forrest.Gump,"01:36:15,186","01:36:17,178","<i>After that, shrimping was easy.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:36:22,860","01:36:25,978",<i>Since people still needed them shrimps for shrimp cocktails</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:36:26,072","01:36:30,191","and barbecues and all, and we were the only boat left standing,"
Forrest.Gump,"01:36:30,368","01:36:33,611",Bubba-Gump Shrimp's what they got.
Forrest.Gump,"01:36:33,705","01:36:38,291","We got a whole bunch of boats, 12 <i>Jennys,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:36:38,376","01:36:41,869","a big old warehouse. We even have hats that say ""Bubba-Gump"" on them."
Forrest.Gump,"01:36:42,213","01:36:45,502",Bubba-Gump Shrimp. It's a household name.
Forrest.Gump,"01:36:45,717","01:36:47,424","Hold on there, boy."
Forrest.Gump,"01:36:47,552","01:36:52,092",Are you telling me you're the owner of the Bubba-Gump Shrimp Corporation?
Forrest.Gump,"01:36:52,223","01:36:55,216","Yes, sir. We got more money than Davy Crockett."
Forrest.Gump,"01:36:56,853","01:37:00,893","Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time, but that tops them all."
Forrest.Gump,"01:37:03,609","01:37:06,397",We was sitting next to a millionaire.
Forrest.Gump,"01:37:09,907","01:37:14,527","Well, I thought it was a very lovely story,"
Forrest.Gump,"01:37:14,954","01:37:19,574","and you tell it so well, with such enthusiasm."
Forrest.Gump,"01:37:21,294","01:37:23,957",Would you like to see what Lieutenant Dan looks like?
Forrest.Gump,"01:37:24,088","01:37:25,579","Well, yes, I would."
Forrest.Gump,"01:37:30,803","01:37:32,840",That's him right there.
Forrest.Gump,"01:37:34,974","01:37:37,216",And let me tell you something about Lieutenant Dan...
Forrest.Gump,"01:37:38,394","01:37:39,430","Forrest,"
Forrest.Gump,"01:37:44,984","01:37:47,772",I never thanked you for saving my life.
Forrest.Gump,"01:38:13,805","01:38:20,097","<i>He never actually said so, but I think he made his peace with God.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:38:27,777","01:38:29,985","<i>For the second time in 17 days,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:38:30,113","01:38:33,572",<i>President Ford escaped possible assassination today.</i>

Forrest.Gump,"01:38:40,206","01:38:42,698","Yeah, well, you'll have to tell them to call him back."
Forrest.Gump,"01:38:42,792","01:38:46,160",- He is indisposed at the moment. <i>- His mama's sick.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:39:06,858","01:39:09,225",- Where's Mama? - She's upstairs.
Forrest.Gump,"01:39:12,071","01:39:14,028","Hi, Forrest."
Forrest.Gump,"01:39:14,991","01:39:17,529",- I'll see you tomorrow. - All right.
Forrest.Gump,"01:39:24,208","01:39:27,372","We sure got you straightened out, didn't we, boy?"
Forrest.Gump,"01:39:38,723","01:39:42,683","- What's the matter, Mama? - I'm dying, Forrest."
Forrest.Gump,"01:39:46,022","01:39:48,389","Come on in, sit down over here."
Forrest.Gump,"01:40:02,747","01:40:06,240","- Why are you dying, Mama? - It's my time."
Forrest.Gump,"01:40:07,251","01:40:09,117",It's just my time.
Forrest.Gump,"01:40:10,588","01:40:14,753","Now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart."
Forrest.Gump,"01:40:16,385","01:40:18,752","Death is just a part of life,"
Forrest.Gump,"01:40:19,764","01:40:22,381",something we're all destined to do.
Forrest.Gump,"01:40:24,227","01:40:28,597","I didn't know it, but I was destined to be your mama."
Forrest.Gump,"01:40:29,440","01:40:33,024","- I did the best I could. - You did good, Mama."
Forrest.Gump,"01:40:33,819","01:40:38,985","Well, I happen to believe you make your own destiny."
Forrest.Gump,"01:40:40,493","01:40:43,736",You have to do the best with what God gave you.
Forrest.Gump,"01:40:47,625","01:40:49,742","What's my destiny, Mama?"
Forrest.Gump,"01:40:51,921","01:40:55,130",You're going to have to figure that out for yourself.
Forrest.Gump,"01:40:56,425","01:40:59,384","Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest."
Forrest.Gump,"01:40:59,470","01:41:01,632",You never know what you're going to get.
Forrest.Gump,"01:41:01,764","01:41:06,134",<i>Mama always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:41:06,227","01:41:08,435","I will miss you, Forrest."
Forrest.Gump,"01:41:10,273","01:41:14,313",<i>She had got the cancer and died on a Tuesday.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:41:15,820","01:41:19,154",<i>I bought her a new hat with little flowers on it.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:41:22,201","01:41:25,490",And that's all I have to say about that.
Forrest.Gump,"01:41:32,336","01:41:34,623",Didn't you say you were waiting for the number seven bus?
Forrest.Gump,"01:41:34,714","01:41:37,502",There'll be another one along shortly.
Forrest.Gump,"01:41:41,345","01:41:44,929","Now, because I had been a football star, and a war hero,"
Forrest.Gump,"01:41:45,016","01:41:48,134","and a national celebrity, and a shrimping boat captain,"
Forrest.Gump,"01:41:48,644","01:41:51,853","and a college graduate, the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama"
Forrest.Gump,"01:41:51,981","01:41:55,190",decided to get together and offered me a fine job.
Forrest.Gump,"01:41:56,569","01:42:00,233","<i>So, I never went back to work for Lieutenant Dan,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:42:00,364","01:42:03,072",<i>though he did take care of my Bubba-Gump money.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:42:03,200","01:42:07,786",<i>He got me invested in some kind of fruit company.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:42:07,872","01:42:09,512","<i>And so then, I got a call from him saying</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:42:09,540","01:42:12,999","we don't have to worry about money no more, and I said,"
Forrest.Gump,"01:42:13,085","01:42:15,372","""That's good. One less thing."""
Forrest.Gump,"01:42:18,424","01:42:21,792","<i>Now, Mama said there's only so much fortune a man really needs,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:42:23,054","01:42:25,922",<i>and the rest is just for showing off.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:42:26,015","01:42:29,884","<i>So, I gave a whole bunch of it to the Foursquare gospel church,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:42:32,563","01:42:37,058",<i>and I gave a whole bunch to the Bayou La Batre fishing hospital.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:42:39,403","01:42:43,943","<i>And even though Bubba was dead and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:42:44,075","01:42:46,692",<i>I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:42:50,915","01:42:52,622",You know what?
Forrest.Gump,"01:42:53,876","01:42:56,869",<i>She didn't have to work in nobody's kitchen no more.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:42:56,962","01:42:58,578",That smells wonderful.
Forrest.Gump,"01:42:59,423","01:43:03,337","<i>And 'cause I was a gazillionaire and I liked doing it so much,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:43:03,427","01:43:05,760",<i>I cut that grass for free.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:43:09,558","01:43:12,426",<i>But at night time when there was nothing to do</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:43:12,520","01:43:14,887","<i>and the house was all empty,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:43:15,898","01:43:18,265",<i>I'd always think of Jenny.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:44:21,964","01:44:25,128","<i>And then, she was there.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:44:58,125","01:45:01,289","- Hello, Forrest. - Hello, Jenny."
Forrest.Gump,"01:45:12,848","01:45:15,465",<i>Jenny came back and stayed with me.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:45:17,061","01:45:20,725","<i>Maybe it was because she had nowhere else to go,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:45:20,856","01:45:24,566","<i>or maybe it was because she was so tired, 'cause she went to bed</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:45:24,693","01:45:28,653","<i>and slept and slept, like she hadn't slept in years.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:45:29,907","01:45:32,194",<i>It was wonderful having her home.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:45:33,536","01:45:38,656","<i>Every day we'd take a walk and I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:45:38,749","01:45:41,287","<i>and she'd listen about Ping-Ponging, and shrimping,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:45:41,377","01:45:45,667",<i>and Mama making a trip up to heaven. I did all the talking.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:45:45,756","01:45:49,090",<i>Jenny most of the time was real quiet.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:46:29,258","01:46:32,467",How could you do this?
Forrest.Gump,"01:47:09,423","01:47:12,757",<i>Sometimes I guess there just aren't enough rocks.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:47:14,970","01:47:19,465","<i>I never really knew why she came back, but I didn't care.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:47:19,642","01:47:23,932",<i>It was like olden times. We was like peas and carrots again.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:47:26,023","01:47:30,358","<i>Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers and put them in her room for her,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:47:31,862","01:47:35,446",<i>and she gave me the best gift anyone could ever get in the wide world.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:47:35,532","01:47:38,366",- New shoes. - They make them just for running.
Forrest.Gump,"01:47:43,374","01:47:46,663",<i>And she even showed me how to dance.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:47:54,843","01:47:59,053","<i>And, well, we was like family, Jenny and me.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:48:02,810","01:48:05,723",<i>And it was the happiest time in my life.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:48:25,374","01:48:27,161",<i>...and this Fourth is witnessing one of the</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:48:27,251","01:48:30,244",<i>largest fireworks displays in the nation's...</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:48:30,337","01:48:33,250",- You done watching it? <i>- ...here in New York Harbor...</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:48:33,382","01:48:35,235",- I'm going to bed. <i>- ...with a spectacular display</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:48:35,259","01:48:38,297",<i>of tall ships earlier. The Statue of Liberty...</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:48:45,352","01:48:47,344",Will you marry me?
Forrest.Gump,"01:48:52,276","01:48:55,235","I'd make a good husband, Jenny."
Forrest.Gump,"01:48:57,906","01:48:59,943","You would, Forrest."
Forrest.Gump,"01:49:01,785","01:49:04,118",But you won't marry me.
Forrest.Gump,"01:49:06,415","01:49:08,623",You don't want to marry me.
Forrest.Gump,"01:49:12,212","01:49:14,625","Why don't you love me, Jenny?"
Forrest.Gump,"01:49:19,636","01:49:21,753","I'm not a smart man,"
Forrest.Gump,"01:49:23,474","01:49:25,887",but I know what love is.
Forrest.Gump,"01:50:02,930","01:50:04,171",Jenny.
Forrest.Gump,"01:50:06,100","01:50:08,592","Forrest, I do love you."
Forrest.Gump,"01:51:01,738","01:51:05,402",- Where are you running off to? - I'm not running.
Forrest.Gump,"01:52:37,000","01:52:42,337","<i>That day, for no particular reason, I decided to go for a little run.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:52:43,507","01:52:47,922","<i>So, I ran to the end of the road, and when I got there,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:52:48,011","01:52:49,752",<i>I thought maybe I'd run to the end of town.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:52:49,846","01:52:53,089","<i>President Carter, suffering from heat exhaustion, fell into the arms of...</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:52:53,183","01:52:54,845","<i>And when I got there,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:52:54,935","01:52:59,100",<i>I thought maybe I'd just run across Greenbow County.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:52:59,189","01:53:01,602","<i>And I figured since I'd run this far,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:53:01,692","01:53:04,935",<i>maybe I'd just run across the great state of Alabama.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:53:05,028","01:53:06,235",<i>And that's what I did.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:53:06,863","01:53:08,650",I ran clear across Alabama.
Forrest.Gump,"01:53:09,700","01:53:12,864","For no particular reason, I just kept on going."
Forrest.Gump,"01:53:14,204","01:53:15,786",I ran clear to the ocean.
Forrest.Gump,"01:53:21,670","01:53:24,834","<i>And when I got there, I figured since I'd gone this far,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:53:25,382","01:53:28,216",<i>might as well turn around and just keep on going.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:53:31,972","01:53:36,558","<i>And when I got to another ocean, I figured since I'd gone this far,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:53:38,353","01:53:42,063",<i>I might as well just turn back and keep right on going.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:53:43,233","01:53:48,069","<i>When I got tired, I slept. When I got hungry, I ate.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:53:48,155","01:53:51,193","When I had to go, you know..."
Forrest.Gump,"01:53:52,826","01:53:53,987",I went.
Forrest.Gump,"01:53:54,077","01:53:57,070","And so, you just ran."
Forrest.Gump,"01:53:58,832","01:53:59,913",Yeah.
Forrest.Gump,"01:54:35,202","01:54:40,448",<i>I'd think a lot about Mama and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:54:41,458","01:54:44,951","<i>But most of all, I thought about Jenny.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:54:46,046","01:54:48,208",<i>I thought about her a lot.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:54:48,965","01:54:52,049","<i>For more than two years now, a man named Forrest Gump,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:54:52,135","01:54:55,549","<i>a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama, stopping only to sleep,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:54:55,639","01:54:57,801",<i>has been running across America.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:54:57,891","01:54:59,883",<i>Charles Cooper brings us this report.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:00,811","01:55:03,224","<i>For the fourth time on his journey across America,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:03,313","01:55:06,147","<i>Forrest Gump, the gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:06,274","01:55:09,142",<i>is about to cross the Mississippi River again today.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:09,778","01:55:11,881","- I'll be damned. Forrest? <i>- Sir, why are you running?</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:11,905","01:55:12,986",Why are you running?
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:13,073","01:55:14,655",Are you doing this for world peace?
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:14,741","01:55:16,135",Are you doing this for the homeless?
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:16,159","01:55:19,152",- Are you running for women's rights? - Or for the environment?
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:19,246","01:55:20,246",Or for animals?
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:20,330","01:55:23,243",<i>They just couldn't believe that somebody would do all that running</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:23,333","01:55:24,699",<i>for no particular reason.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:24,793","01:55:26,750",Why are you doing this?
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:26,837","01:55:29,329",I just felt like running.
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:29,464","01:55:31,831",I just felt like running.
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:31,967","01:55:35,176",It's you. I can't believe it's really you.
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:36,012","01:55:41,132","Now, for some reason, what I was doing seemed to make sense to people."
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:41,309","01:55:43,496","I mean, it was like an alarm went off in my head, you know?"
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:43,520","01:55:45,456","I said, ""Here's a guy that's got his act together."
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:45,480","01:55:47,437","""Here's somebody who's got it all figured out."
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:47,524","01:55:51,609","""Here's somebody who has the answer."" I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump."
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:51,695","01:55:53,527","<i>So, I got company.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:55:55,365","01:56:01,202","<i>And after that, I got more company. And then, even more people joined in.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:56:03,665","01:56:06,874",Somebody later told me it gave people hope.
Forrest.Gump,"01:56:08,670","01:56:12,038","Now... Now, I don't know anything about that,"
Forrest.Gump,"01:56:12,883","01:56:15,466",<i>but some of those people asked me if I could help them out.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:56:15,677","01:56:18,920","Hey, man, hey, listen, I was wondering if you might help me, huh?"
Forrest.Gump,"01:56:19,014","01:56:20,755","Listen, I'm in the bumper sticker business"
Forrest.Gump,"01:56:20,849","01:56:22,660",and I've been trying to think up a good slogan.
Forrest.Gump,"01:56:22,684","01:56:25,802","And since you have been such a big inspiration to the people around here,"
Forrest.Gump,"01:56:25,896","01:56:27,874",I thought you might be able to help me jump into...
Forrest.Gump,"01:56:27,898","01:56:31,517","Whoa, man! You just ran through a big pile of dog shit!"
Forrest.Gump,"01:56:33,069","01:56:35,732","- It happens. - What, shit?"
Forrest.Gump,"01:56:37,240","01:56:39,197",Sometimes.
Forrest.Gump,"01:56:41,077","01:56:43,740","<i>And some years later, I heard that that fellow</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:56:43,830","01:56:45,446","<i>did come up with a bumper sticker slogan,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:56:45,540","01:56:48,749",<i>and he made a lot of money off of it.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:56:50,212","01:56:52,420","<i>Another time, I was running along,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:56:52,547","01:56:55,836","<i>somebody who had lost all his money in the T-shirt business,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:56:55,926","01:56:57,963","<i>he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:56:58,053","01:57:01,012","<i>but he couldn't draw that well, and he didn't have a camera.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:57:01,097","01:57:04,590","Here, use this one. Nobody likes that color anyway."
Forrest.Gump,"01:57:09,439","01:57:11,101",Have a nice day.
Forrest.Gump,"01:57:12,734","01:57:13,850","<i>Well, some years later,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:57:13,944","01:57:17,858",<i>I found out that that man did come up with an idea for a T-shirt.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:57:17,948","01:57:20,315",<i>He made a lot of money off of it.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:57:23,119","01:57:27,534","<i>Anyway, like I was saying, I had a lot of company.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:57:28,792","01:57:29,953","<i>My mama always said,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:57:30,043","01:57:34,458","<i>""You got to put the past behind you before you can move on.""</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:57:36,132","01:57:39,466",<i>And I think that's what my running was all about.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:57:40,303","01:57:44,297","<i>I had run for three years, two months,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:57:44,558","01:57:46,891",<i>14 days and 16 hours.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:58:02,576","01:58:04,909",Quiet. Quiet. He's going to say something.
Forrest.Gump,"01:58:16,339","01:58:18,080",I'm pretty tired.
Forrest.Gump,"01:58:20,927","01:58:22,964",Think I'll go home now.
Forrest.Gump,"01:58:41,531","01:58:43,989",Now what are we supposed to do?
Forrest.Gump,"01:58:44,951","01:58:49,195","<i>And just like that, my running days was over.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:58:51,166","01:58:52,907","<i>So, I went home to Alabama.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:58:53,710","01:58:57,875","<i>Moments ago, at 2:25 p.m., as President Reagan was leaving the...</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:58:59,633","01:59:03,798",<i>...five or six gunshots were fired by an unknown would-be assassin.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"01:59:04,304","01:59:06,637","<i>The President was shot in the chest, and the assailant...</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"01:59:06,723","01:59:08,680",I picked up the mail.
Forrest.Gump,"01:59:09,476","01:59:13,311","And one day, out of the blue clear sky, I got a letter from Jenny,"
Forrest.Gump,"01:59:13,396","01:59:17,640","wondering if I could come down to Savannah and see her,"
Forrest.Gump,"01:59:17,734","01:59:20,317",and that's what I'm doing here.
Forrest.Gump,"01:59:20,403","01:59:22,986","She saw me on TV, running."
Forrest.Gump,"01:59:23,073","01:59:27,317",I'm supposed to go on the number nine bus to Richmond Street
Forrest.Gump,"01:59:27,410","01:59:34,328","and get off and go one block left to 1947 Henry Street, Apartment 4."
Forrest.Gump,"01:59:34,417","01:59:38,081","Why, you don't need to take a bus."
Forrest.Gump,"01:59:38,213","01:59:42,753",Henry Street is just five or six blocks down that way.
Forrest.Gump,"01:59:44,594","01:59:46,927",- Down that way? - Down that way.
Forrest.Gump,"01:59:49,933","01:59:51,845",It was nice talking to you.
Forrest.Gump,"01:59:52,894","01:59:55,511",I hope everything works out for you!
Forrest.Gump,"02:00:03,279","02:00:04,941",Hey!
Forrest.Gump,"02:00:05,365","02:00:07,027",Forrest!
Forrest.Gump,"02:00:07,283","02:00:10,526","How you doing? Come in, come in!"
Forrest.Gump,"02:00:10,620","02:00:11,827",I got your letter.
Forrest.Gump,"02:00:11,913","02:00:14,530",I was wondering about that.
Forrest.Gump,"02:00:16,084","02:00:17,871",Is this your house?
Forrest.Gump,"02:00:17,961","02:00:21,045",Yeah. It's messy right now. I just got off work.
Forrest.Gump,"02:00:21,131","02:00:24,841",It's nice. You got air conditioning.
Forrest.Gump,"02:00:31,725","02:00:33,762",- Thank you. - I ate some.
Forrest.Gump,"02:00:36,563","02:00:41,979","Hey, I kept a scrapbook of your clippings and everything."
Forrest.Gump,"02:00:42,110","02:00:43,726",There you are.
Forrest.Gump,"02:00:45,488","02:00:46,608","And this, I got you running."
Forrest.Gump,"02:00:49,659","02:00:51,821","I ran a long way,"
Forrest.Gump,"02:00:52,328","02:00:54,160",for a long time.
Forrest.Gump,"02:00:56,374","02:00:57,865",And there...
Forrest.Gump,"02:01:04,382","02:01:07,841","Listen, Forrest, I don't know how to say this."
Forrest.Gump,"02:01:10,346","02:01:14,681","I just I want to apologize for anything that I ever did to you,"
Forrest.Gump,"02:01:14,809","02:01:20,055","'cause I was messed up for a long time, and..."
Forrest.Gump,"02:01:22,859","02:01:24,475",- Hey. - Hi.
Forrest.Gump,"02:01:24,694","02:01:25,694","Hey, you."
Forrest.Gump,"02:01:26,863","02:01:29,822",- This is an old friend from Alabama. - How do you do?
Forrest.Gump,"02:01:29,908","02:01:32,992","Listen, next week my schedule changes, so I'll be able to... But thanks..."
Forrest.Gump,"02:01:33,077","02:01:35,114","No problem. Got to go, Jen, I'm double-parked."
Forrest.Gump,"02:01:35,205","02:01:37,071",- Okay. Thanks. - Bye.
Forrest.Gump,"02:01:40,543","02:01:43,286","This is my very good friend, Mr. Gump. Can you say hi to him?"
Forrest.Gump,"02:01:43,379","02:01:46,463","- Hello, Mr. Gump. - Hello."
Forrest.Gump,"02:01:46,549","02:01:49,542","- Can I go watch TV now? - Yes, you can. Just keep it low."
Forrest.Gump,"02:01:52,388","02:01:55,722","- You're a mama, Jenny. - I'm a mama."
Forrest.Gump,"02:01:58,603","02:02:00,435",His name's Forrest.
Forrest.Gump,"02:02:01,564","02:02:02,896",Like me.
Forrest.Gump,"02:02:04,526","02:02:06,643",I named him after his daddy.
Forrest.Gump,"02:02:07,612","02:02:10,070","He got a daddy named Forrest, too?"
Forrest.Gump,"02:02:11,366","02:02:13,403","You're his daddy, Forrest."
Forrest.Gump,"02:02:27,882","02:02:29,089",Hey.
Forrest.Gump,"02:02:30,260","02:02:33,128","Forrest, look at me. Look at me, Forrest."
Forrest.Gump,"02:02:35,723","02:02:39,842","There's nothing you need to do, okay? You didn't do anything wrong."
Forrest.Gump,"02:02:40,395","02:02:41,761",Okay?
Forrest.Gump,"02:02:46,109","02:02:47,975",Isn't he beautiful?
Forrest.Gump,"02:02:48,987","02:02:51,946",He's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Forrest.Gump,"02:02:55,743","02:02:56,824",But...
Forrest.Gump,"02:03:00,498","02:03:03,366","Is he smart, or..."
Forrest.Gump,"02:03:03,459","02:03:07,453",He's very smart. He's one of the smartest in his class.
Forrest.Gump,"02:03:16,806","02:03:19,264","Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him."
Forrest.Gump,"02:03:28,610","02:03:31,444",- What are you watching? - Bert and Ernie.
Forrest.Gump,"02:03:54,552","02:03:56,339","Forrest,"
Forrest.Gump,"02:03:57,805","02:03:59,341",I'm sick.
Forrest.Gump,"02:04:02,018","02:04:05,637","What, do you have a cough due to a cold?"
Forrest.Gump,"02:04:05,730","02:04:08,097","I have some kind of virus,"
Forrest.Gump,"02:04:08,191","02:04:10,899","and the doctors don't... They don't know what it is,"
Forrest.Gump,"02:04:11,027","02:04:14,020",and there isn't anything they can do about it.
Forrest.Gump,"02:04:18,409","02:04:20,696",You could come home with me.
Forrest.Gump,"02:04:22,372","02:04:28,039","Jenny, you and little Forrest could come stay at my house in Greenbow."
Forrest.Gump,"02:04:32,382","02:04:35,170",I'll take care of you if you're sick.
Forrest.Gump,"02:04:37,553","02:04:39,840","Would you marry me, Forrest?"
Forrest.Gump,"02:04:45,103","02:04:46,344",Okay.
Forrest.Gump,"02:04:47,397","02:04:49,059",Please take your seats.
Forrest.Gump,"02:04:52,902","02:04:55,235",Forrest? It's time to start.
Forrest.Gump,"02:05:14,632","02:05:16,214",Hi.
Forrest.Gump,"02:05:17,093","02:05:18,584",Your tie.
Forrest.Gump,"02:05:31,149","02:05:32,765",Lieutenant Dan.
Forrest.Gump,"02:05:48,124","02:05:50,081",Lieutenant Dan.
Forrest.Gump,"02:05:50,918","02:05:52,580","Hello, Forrest."
Forrest.Gump,"02:05:53,254","02:05:55,917",You got new legs. New legs!
Forrest.Gump,"02:05:57,133","02:06:00,922",Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.
Forrest.Gump,"02:06:01,637","02:06:05,631",Titanium alloy. It's what they use on the space shuttle.
Forrest.Gump,"02:06:09,479","02:06:10,970",Magic legs.
Forrest.Gump,"02:06:12,982","02:06:17,352","This is my fiancée, Susan."
Forrest.Gump,"02:06:20,156","02:06:23,524","- Lieutenant Dan. - Hi, Forrest."
Forrest.Gump,"02:06:25,620","02:06:28,829","Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny."
Forrest.Gump,"02:06:29,207","02:06:32,200",Hey. It's nice to meet you finally.
Forrest.Gump,"02:06:42,345","02:06:46,510","Do you, Forrest, take Jenny to be your wife?"
Forrest.Gump,"02:06:48,392","02:06:52,636","Do you, Jenny, take Forrest to be your husband?"
Forrest.Gump,"02:06:53,981","02:06:57,349",And so I pronounce you man and wife.
Forrest.Gump,"02:07:28,224","02:07:30,090",- Hey. - Hey.
Forrest.Gump,"02:07:43,781","02:07:45,568","Hey, Forrest."
Forrest.Gump,"02:07:50,913","02:07:52,700",Were you scared in Vietnam?
Forrest.Gump,"02:07:54,375","02:07:56,708","Yes. Well, I..."
Forrest.Gump,"02:07:58,045","02:07:59,752",I don't know.
Forrest.Gump,"02:08:00,464","02:08:05,425",<i>Sometimes it would stop raining long enough for the stars to come out.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"02:08:08,556","02:08:10,593",<i>And then it was nice.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"02:08:13,978","02:08:17,938",It was like just before the sun goes to bed down on the bayou.
Forrest.Gump,"02:08:19,233","02:08:23,102",<i>There was always a million sparkles on the water.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"02:08:24,906","02:08:28,820","<i>Like that mountain lake. It was so clear, Jenny,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"02:08:28,951","02:08:33,537","<i>it looked like there were two skies, one on top of the other.</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"02:08:36,083","02:08:39,121","And then, in the desert, when the sun comes up,"
Forrest.Gump,"02:08:41,589","02:08:45,754",<i>I couldn't tell where heaven stopped</i>
Forrest.Gump,"02:08:46,302","02:08:48,669",<i>and the earth began.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"02:08:49,931","02:08:51,797",<i>It was so beautiful.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"02:08:56,520","02:08:59,604",I wish I could've been there with you.
Forrest.Gump,"02:09:02,693","02:09:04,104",You were.
Forrest.Gump,"02:09:14,830","02:09:16,287",I love you.
Forrest.Gump,"02:09:20,670","02:09:24,004",<i>You died on a Saturday morning.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"02:09:25,716","02:09:29,460",And I had you placed here under our tree.
Forrest.Gump,"02:09:34,350","02:09:39,186",And I had that house of your father's bulldozed to the ground.
Forrest.Gump,"02:09:43,317","02:09:44,979",<i>Mama</i>
Forrest.Gump,"02:09:46,070","02:09:51,065",always said that dying was a part of life.
Forrest.Gump,"02:09:54,495","02:09:56,828",I sure wish it wasn't.
Forrest.Gump,"02:09:59,500","02:10:03,244",Little Forrest is doing just fine.
Forrest.Gump,"02:10:04,588","02:10:05,669",But...
Forrest.Gump,"02:10:05,923","02:10:08,586","<i>About to start school again soon,</i>"
Forrest.Gump,"02:10:10,428","02:10:14,217","and I make his breakfast, lunch and dinner every day."
Forrest.Gump,"02:10:16,392","02:10:22,389",I make sure he combs his hair and brushes his teeth every day.
Forrest.Gump,"02:10:25,526","02:10:28,109",Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.
Forrest.Gump,"02:10:29,405","02:10:30,441",Okay.
Forrest.Gump,"02:10:30,698","02:10:31,859",<i>He's really good.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"02:10:31,949","02:10:34,066","Forrest, you go."
Forrest.Gump,"02:10:38,289","02:10:39,871",<i>We fish a lot.</i>
Forrest.Gump,"02:10:43,419","02:10:46,878","And every night, we read a book. He's so smart, Jenny."
Forrest.Gump,"02:10:50,134","02:10:52,376",You'd be so proud of him.
Forrest.Gump,"02:10:54,096","02:10:55,553",I am.
Forrest.Gump,"02:10:56,599","02:10:59,808",He wrote you a letter.
Forrest.Gump,"02:11:01,395","02:11:03,432",And he says I can't read it.
Forrest.Gump,"02:11:03,564","02:11:07,103","I'm not supposed to, so I'll just leave it here for you."
Forrest.Gump,"02:11:23,167","02:11:24,499","Jenny,"
Forrest.Gump,"02:11:30,299","02:11:33,508","I don't know if Mama was right,"
Forrest.Gump,"02:11:34,845","02:11:36,336",or if it's Lieutenant Dan.
Forrest.Gump,"02:11:36,472","02:11:39,055",I don't know
Forrest.Gump,"02:11:39,141","02:11:43,636","if we each have a destiny,"
Forrest.Gump,"02:11:45,689","02:11:50,809",or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze.
Forrest.Gump,"02:11:55,324","02:11:57,156",But I think
Forrest.Gump,"02:11:59,036","02:12:00,823",maybe it's both.
Forrest.Gump,"02:12:05,167","02:12:08,035",Maybe both is happening at the same time.
Forrest.Gump,"02:12:14,176","02:12:16,168","But I miss you, Jenny."
Forrest.Gump,"02:12:22,560","02:12:26,975","If there's anything you need, I won't be far away."
Forrest.Gump,"02:13:02,266","02:13:05,225",Here's your bus. Okay.
Forrest.Gump,"02:13:06,896","02:13:10,230",Hey. I know this.
Forrest.Gump,"02:13:10,357","02:13:13,225",I'm gonna show that for show-and-tell because
Forrest.Gump,"02:13:13,360","02:13:16,023",Grandma used to read it to you.
Forrest.Gump,"02:13:16,113","02:13:18,230",My favorite book.
Forrest.Gump,"02:13:21,577","02:13:23,068",Here we are.
Forrest.Gump,"02:13:23,245","02:13:24,702",Okay.
Forrest.Gump,"02:13:26,415","02:13:27,906",Here you go.
Forrest.Gump,"02:13:32,796","02:13:35,288","Hey, Forrest, don't..."
Forrest.Gump,"02:13:38,761","02:13:42,471","- I wanted to tell you, I love you. - I love you, too, Daddy."
Forrest.Gump,"02:13:44,475","02:13:47,263",I'll be right here when you get back.
Forrest.Gump,"02:13:51,815","02:13:55,058","You understand this is the bus to school, now, don't you?"
Forrest.Gump,"02:13:55,152","02:13:58,691","Of course, and you are Dorothy Harris, and I'm Forrest Gump."
