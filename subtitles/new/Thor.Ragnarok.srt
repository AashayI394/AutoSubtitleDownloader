1
00:00:46,553 --> 00:00:48,396
Now I know what you're
thinking. "Oh, no!"

2
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:52,258
"Thor's in a cage. How did
this happen?" Well, sometimes,

3
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,445
you have to get captured just to
get a straight answer out of someone.

4
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,227
Long story, basically
I'm a bit of a hero.

5
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:04,236
See, I spent some time on Earth.

6
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:10,112
Fought some robots, saved the planet a couple of times.
Then I went searching thru the cosmos for some...

7
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,079
Magic, colorful "Infinity Stone" things.

8
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,049
Couldn't find any.

9
00:01:15,224 --> 00:01:18,026
That's when I came across
the path of death,

10
00:01:18,062 --> 00:01:19,174
and destruction.

11
00:01:19,182 --> 00:01:23,932
Which led me all the
way here, into this cage...

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,104
Where I met you.

13
00:01:31,064 --> 00:01:33,930
How much longer do you
think we'd be here?

14
00:01:46,864 --> 00:01:50,657
Thor, son of Odin.

15
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:55,763
Surtur! You're still alive.

16
00:01:55,808 --> 00:01:58,506
I thought my father killed you. Like,

17
00:01:58,544 --> 00:01:59,760
half a million years ago.

18
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:01,647
I cannot die.

19
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:05,664
Not until I fulfill my destiny
and lay waste to your home.

20
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:10,386
It's funny you should mention that, because
I've been having these terrible dreams of late.

21
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:15,429
Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins, and
you, Surtur, in the center of all of them.

22
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,540
Then you can see Ragnarok.

23
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:20,520
The fall of Asgard.

24
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:23,322
- The great prophecy...
- Hang on! Hang on.

25
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:27,240
I'll be back around shortly.

26
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:30,241
I really feel like we
were connecting there.

27
00:02:32,364 --> 00:02:36,154
Okay, so, Ragnarok.
Tell me about that.

28
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:41,231
My time has come. When my crown is
reunited with the Eternal Flame...

29
00:02:41,272 --> 00:02:46,177
I shall be restored to my full might.
I will tower over the mountains...

30
00:02:46,188 --> 00:02:49,145
And bury my sword deep in Asgard...

31
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,147
Hang on.

32
00:02:50,148 --> 00:02:52,060
Give it a second.

33
00:02:52,062 --> 00:02:55,019
I swear, I'm not even moving.
It's just doing this on its own.

34
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,978
Everytime...

35
00:02:56,978 --> 00:03:00,003
Okay, so let me get this straight.

36
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:05,782
You're gonna put your crown, in the Eternal Flame,
and then you suddenly grow as big as a house?

37
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:06,834
A mountain!

38
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:09,935
The Eternal Flame that Odin
keeps locked away on Asgard?

39
00:03:09,943 --> 00:03:12,881
Odin is not on Asgard.

40
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:16,636
And your absence has left
the throne defenseless.

41
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:18,711
Okay, so where is it?
This crown?

42
00:03:18,754 --> 00:03:22,546
This is my crown. The
source of my power.

43
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:25,607
Oh, that's a crown? I thought
it was a big eyebrow.

44
00:03:25,648 --> 00:03:27,494
It's a crown.

45
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:33,525
Anyway, It sounds like to stop Ragnarok,
I just rip that thing off your head?

46
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,568
But Ragnarok has already begun.

47
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:39,507
You cannot stop it.

48
00:03:48,284 --> 00:03:49,497
I am Asgard's doom.

49
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:55,173
And so are you. All will suffer.
All will burn!

50
00:03:55,213 --> 00:03:56,392
That's intense.

51
00:03:56,432 --> 00:04:02,136
To be honest, seeing you grow really big and
set fire to a planet would be quite a spectacle.

52
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:06,088
But it looks like I'm gonna have to choose
option B, where I bust out of these chains...

53
00:04:06,132 --> 00:04:10,081
Knock that tiara off your head, and
stash it away in Asgard's vault.

54
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:13,118
You can not stop Ragnarok.

55
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,208
Why fight it?

56
00:04:14,217 --> 00:04:18,963
Because, that's what heroes do.

57
00:04:22,994 --> 00:04:25,951
Wait, I'm sorry. I
didn't time that right.

58
00:04:26,985 --> 00:04:29,054
And now!

59
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:36,715
You have made a grave
mistake, Odinson.

60
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:39,811
I make grave mistakes all the time.

61
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:44,668
Everything seems to work out.

62
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:02,841
Heimdall, I know it's been a while...

63
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:05,734
but I could really use a fast exit!

64
00:06:06,722 --> 00:06:07,871
Heimdall?

65
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,804
Heimdall was an idiot.

66
00:06:10,815 --> 00:06:13,719
This job should've made him rich.

67
00:06:13,752 --> 00:06:17,610
The job ain't easy, but it
does have its benefits.

68
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:21,662
The Bifrost gives me access to
everything the Nine Realms has to offer.

69
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,730
I mean it's all mine for the taking.

70
00:06:25,597 --> 00:06:27,699
Behold...

71
00:06:28,732 --> 00:06:30,678
My stuff.

72
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:37,471
I'm particularly fond of these. I pulled them
out of a place in Midgard called Tehk-Sas.

73
00:06:37,507 --> 00:06:41,457
I even named them Des and Troy.

74
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,461
You see, when you put them together...

75
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,233
They destroy.

76
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,166
Heimdall? Come on.

77
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:27,920
Stay!

78
00:07:29,011 --> 00:07:30,789
Heimdall?

79
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,829
I'm running short of options.

80
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,717
Heimdalll?

81
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:37,720
Skurge...

82
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:41,769
Is that important?

83
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:50,721
You girls are in for a treat.

84
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:43,972
Girls!

85
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:46,934
Well, well, well.

86
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:49,045
Look who decided to pop in.

87
00:08:49,054 --> 00:08:50,931
Thanks for scaring away my company

88
00:08:50,934 --> 00:08:52,902
and drenching the
workplace with brains.

89
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:53,903
Who are you?

90
00:08:53,903 --> 00:08:54,950
Don't you remember?

91
00:08:54,991 --> 00:08:56,994
I'm Skurge, we've
fought together

92
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,882
- on Vanaheim.
- Right.

93
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,932
Where is Heimdall?

94
00:08:59,943 --> 00:09:02,968
That traitor? Well, no one knows.
He's a fugitive of the throne.

95
00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:04,103
Traitor?

96
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:09,459
See, Odin charged Heimdall with negligence
of duty but disappeared before the trial.

97
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:11,842
Hard to catch a guy who
can see everything.

98
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,676
Hold on. I'm supposed to
announce your arrival.

99
00:09:39,304 --> 00:09:41,372
What the hell is that?

100
00:09:48,376 --> 00:09:51,335
Oh, Brother...

101
00:09:51,346 --> 00:09:53,314
This is it.

102
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:56,160
- I take my leave.
- You fool!

103
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,165
- You didn't listen.
- I'm sorry.

104
00:09:58,176 --> 00:10:00,055
- Lady Sif, get help!
- Somebody, help!

105
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,125
I'm sorry for all I've done.

106
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,012
Shhh.

107
00:10:04,015 --> 00:10:07,007
- It's all right. Hold on.
- I'm sorry.

108
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,874
I tried to rule Earth.

109
00:10:08,937 --> 00:10:12,190
- They'd be lucky to have you.
- I'm sorry about that thing with the Tesseract.

110
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:14,042
I just couldn't help myself.

111
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:17,077
- I'm a trickster.
- Yes, so mischievious.

112
00:10:17,157 --> 00:10:19,884
Sorry when I turned
you to a frog.

113
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,200
It was a wonderful joke.

114
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,957
It was indeed hilarious.

115
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:26,400
You are the saviour of Asgard.

116
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:29,260
Tell my story. Build a statue for me.

117
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,602
We will build a big statue for you.

118
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:35,048
With my helmet on. With
the big, bendy horns.

119
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:37,954
I will tell father what
you did here today.

120
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:40,018
I didn't do it for him.

121
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,108
I didn't do it...

122
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:43,718
for him.

123
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:56,640
No!

124
00:10:57,896 --> 00:11:00,772
And so, Loki died of his wounds.

125
00:11:00,797 --> 00:11:03,092
Giving his life for ours.

126
00:11:03,124 --> 00:11:05,412
He fought back those disgusting elves.

127
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:08,159
He brought peace to the realm.

128
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:09,845
Loki, my boy...

129
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,619
T'was many moons ago, when
I found you on that...

130
00:11:12,644 --> 00:11:14,810
Frostbitten battlefield.

131
00:11:14,835 --> 00:11:19,611
On that day, I did not yet
see in you, Asgard's savior.

132
00:11:19,652 --> 00:11:24,623
No. You were merely, a
little blue baby

133
00:11:24,665 --> 00:11:29,181
icicle that melted,
this old fool's heart.

134
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:33,488
Bravo. Bravo.

135
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:39,003
Father.

136
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:41,012
Oh, shit.

137
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:44,998
My son, Thor, has returned!
Greetings, my boy.

138
00:11:45,868 --> 00:11:47,975
That's an interesting play.
What's it called?

139
00:11:47,995 --> 00:11:49,968
The tragedy of Loki of Asgard.

140
00:11:49,993 --> 00:11:52,029
People wanted to commemmorate him.

141
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,974
And indeed they should.
Oh, I like the statue.

142
00:11:55,008 --> 00:12:00,710
Looked better-looking than him when he was
alive. A little less weasely, less greasy maybe.

143
00:12:00,813 --> 00:12:02,950
You know what this is?

144
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:05,894
Oh, the skull of Surtur.
That's a formidable weapon.

145
00:12:05,927 --> 00:12:11,800
Do me a favor. Lock this away in the
vault so it doesn't destroy the planet.

146
00:12:12,657 --> 00:12:13,670
Thank you, dear.

147
00:12:13,715 --> 00:12:17,541
Um, so, it's back to
Midgard for you, is it?

148
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:18,688
Nope.

149
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:21,631
You know I've been having
this recurring dream lately.

150
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:24,611
Every night I'd see
Asgard falling to ruins.

151
00:12:24,636 --> 00:12:28,494
That's just a silly dream. Signs
of an overactive imagination.

152
00:12:28,495 --> 00:12:29,452
Possibly.

153
00:12:29,453 --> 00:12:31,422
But then I decided to go
out there and investigate.

154
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:35,449
And what do I find, but the 9
Realms completely in chaos.

155
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,472
Enemies of Asgard assembling.
Plotting our demise, all while you,

156
00:12:39,482 --> 00:12:44,365
Odin, the protector of those 9 Realms, are
sitting here in your bathrobe, eating grapes.

157
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,165
Yes, well it is best to respect
our neighbor's freedom.

158
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:48,149
Yes, of course.

159
00:12:48,193 --> 00:12:50,431
The freedom to be massacred.

160
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:53,682
Yes, besides I've been
rather busy myself...

161
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:57,897
- Watching theater?
- No. Board meetings, security council meetings...

162
00:12:57,922 --> 00:12:59,263
You're gonna really
make me do it?

163
00:12:59,288 --> 00:13:00,492
Do what?

164
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:07,144
You know that nothing will stop
Mjolnir as it returns to my hand...

165
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:08,339
Not even your face.

166
00:13:08,376 --> 00:13:10,118
You've gone quite mad.

167
00:13:10,143 --> 00:13:11,630
You will be executed for this.

168
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:14,467
Then I'll see you on the
other side, brother.

169
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:17,044
All right. I yield!

170
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:27,841
Behold!

171
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:30,819
Thor Odinson.

172
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,697
No.

173
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:34,769
You had one job.

174
00:13:34,812 --> 00:13:36,658
Just the one!

175
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,630
Where is Odin?

176
00:13:38,643 --> 00:13:40,587
You just couldn't
stay away, could you?

177
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,622
Everything was fine without you.

178
00:13:42,663 --> 00:13:45,689
Asgard was prospering.
You've ruined everything.

179
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,722
- Ask them...
- Where's Father? You kill him?

180
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:50,800
You had what you wanted. You had
the independence you asked for.

181
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,779
Okay, I know exactly
where he is.

182
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:07,512
I swear I left him right here.

183
00:14:09,005 --> 00:14:11,496
Here on the sidewalk, or that
building being demolished?

184
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:13,447
- Great planning.
- How was I supposed to know?

185
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,326
I can't see into the future.
I'm not a witch.

186
00:14:15,328 --> 00:14:18,165
Really? Why did you
dress like one?

187
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:20,144
- Hey!
- I can't believe you're alive.

188
00:14:20,144 --> 00:14:21,293
I saw you die.

189
00:14:21,334 --> 00:14:23,211
I mourned you, I cried for you.

190
00:14:23,244 --> 00:14:25,194
I'm honored.

191
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:27,926
Hi, would you mind taking
a picture with us?

192
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,653
Oh, sure.

193
00:14:30,111 --> 00:14:32,180
Start figuring out where he is.

194
00:14:33,146 --> 00:14:35,333
Sorry to hear that
Jane dumped you.

195
00:14:35,885 --> 00:14:37,985
She didn't dump me, though.

196
00:14:37,996 --> 00:14:40,987
I dumped her. It was
a mutual dumping.

197
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:44,324
What's this? What are you doing?

198
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:46,023
This isn't me.

199
00:14:49,082 --> 00:14:50,925
Loki?

200
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,823
Thor Odinson.

201
00:15:27,764 --> 00:15:29,733
God of Thunder.

202
00:15:29,798 --> 00:15:32,664
You can put down the umbrella.

203
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:52,550
So Earth has wizards now?

204
00:15:57,216 --> 00:16:01,161
I prefer the term Master of the
Mystic Arts. You can leave that now.

205
00:16:01,173 --> 00:16:02,985
All right, wizard.

206
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:04,933
Who are you and why should I care?

207
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:09,019
My name is Dr. Stephen Strange,
and I have some questions for you.

208
00:16:09,027 --> 00:16:10,973
Take a seat.

209
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:16,010
Tea?

210
00:16:18,432 --> 00:16:20,210
I don't drink tea.

211
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:21,300
What do you drink?

212
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:23,273
Not tea.

213
00:16:25,726 --> 00:16:30,859
So I keep a watchlist of individuals from other
realms that may be a threat to this world.

214
00:16:30,884 --> 00:16:34,800
Your adoptive brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

215
00:16:34,825 --> 00:16:37,002
That's a worthy inclusion...

216
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:40,771
Why bring him here?

217
00:16:40,796 --> 00:16:42,708
We're looking for my father.

218
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:46,493
So if I were to tell
you where Odin was...

219
00:16:46,518 --> 00:16:48,552
You all return to Asgard?

220
00:16:48,577 --> 00:16:49,609
Promptly.

221
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,636
Great. Then I'll help you.

222
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:54,496
If you knew where he was,
why didn't you call me?

223
00:16:54,522 --> 00:17:00,485
I have to tell you that he was adamant to not be
disturbed. He said he had chosen to remain in exile.

224
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:03,330
And you don't have a phone.

225
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:08,215
No, I don't have a phone, but you
could have sent an electronic letter.

226
00:17:08,217 --> 00:17:09,531
- Called an e-mail?
- Yeah. Do you have a computer?

227
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,237
No. What for?

228
00:17:11,284 --> 00:17:16,358
Anyway, my father is no longer in exile,
so if you could tell me where he is,

229
00:17:16,398 --> 00:17:19,528
- I can take him home.
- Gladly. He is in Norway.

230
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:25,770
Let's see whether this incantation requires
any Asgardian modifications...

231
00:17:25,992 --> 00:17:27,411
Nope.

232
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,051
Can you stop... doing that?

233
00:17:37,052 --> 00:17:40,911
Can I... I need one
strand of your hair.

234
00:17:40,914 --> 00:17:44,072
Let me explain something. My
hair is not to be meddled with.

235
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:53,912
We could've just walked.

236
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,872
He is waiting for you.

237
00:17:57,873 --> 00:17:59,648
All right.

238
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:01,379
Oh, don't forget your umbrella.

239
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:02,821
Oh, yes.

240
00:18:08,695 --> 00:18:11,720
Sorry...

241
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:18,785
I suppose I need my brother back?

242
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:20,470
Oh yeah, right.

243
00:18:25,454 --> 00:18:29,313
I have been falling,
for 30 minutes!

244
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:31,323
You can handle him from here.

245
00:18:31,362 --> 00:18:32,406
Yes, yes.

246
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:34,261
Thank you very much
for your help.

247
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:37,422
- Good luck.
- Handle me? Who are you?

248
00:18:38,223 --> 00:18:40,681
- Loki...
- You think you're some kind of sorcerer?

249
00:18:40,706 --> 00:18:42,380
Don't think for one minute,
you second-rate...

250
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:43,752
All right. Bye-bye!

251
00:19:08,405 --> 00:19:10,023
Father.

252
00:19:11,297 --> 00:19:12,699
Look at this place.

253
00:19:12,754 --> 00:19:14,444
It's beautiful.

254
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,134
Father, it's us.

255
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:25,794
My sons.

256
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:28,113
I've been waiting for you.

257
00:19:28,145 --> 00:19:30,232
I know. We've come
to take you home.

258
00:19:30,288 --> 00:19:32,016
Home? Yes.

259
00:19:32,795 --> 00:19:36,552
Your mother. She calls me.

260
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:39,659
Can you hear it?

261
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:42,827
Loki, lift your magic.

262
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,508
It took me quite a while to
break free from your spell.

263
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:49,458
Frigga would've been proud.

264
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,395
Come sit with me, I
don't have much time.

265
00:19:58,366 --> 00:20:02,257
I know we've failed you, but
we can make this right.

266
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:03,539
I failed you..

267
00:20:04,273 --> 00:20:06,217
It is upon us.

268
00:20:06,218 --> 00:20:07,264
Ragnarok.

269
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:10,902
No, I've stopped Ragnarok,
I've put an end to Surtur.

270
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:14,736
No, it's already begun. She's coming.

271
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:20,128
My life has all but held her back,
but my time has come.

272
00:20:21,234 --> 00:20:23,175
I can not keep her
waiting any longer.

273
00:20:23,209 --> 00:20:26,011
Father .. Who are
you talking about?

274
00:20:26,013 --> 00:20:28,066
Goddess of Death.

275
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:29,445
Hela.

276
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:34,031
My firstborn. Your sister.

277
00:20:36,143 --> 00:20:38,055
What?

278
00:20:40,101 --> 00:20:43,995
Her violent appetites
grew beyond my control.

279
00:20:44,062 --> 00:20:49,730
Couldn't stop her,
so I imprisoned her.

280
00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:53,785
Locked her away. She draws
her strength from Asgard.

281
00:20:53,895 --> 00:20:57,842
When she gets there, her
powers will be limitless.

282
00:20:57,886 --> 00:21:00,823
Whatever she is, we can
stop her together.

283
00:21:00,856 --> 00:21:02,732
No, we won't.

284
00:21:02,735 --> 00:21:05,125
I'm on a different path now.

285
00:21:05,173 --> 00:21:07,803
This you must face alone.

286
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:11,543
I love you, my sons.

287
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:14,606
Look at that.

288
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:24,198
Remember this place. Home.

289
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,531
Brother.

290
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:15,177
This was your doing.

291
00:22:57,071 --> 00:22:59,095
So he's gone?

292
00:23:01,415 --> 00:23:05,065
A shame. I would've
like to have seen that.

293
00:23:05,423 --> 00:23:07,694
You must be Hela.

294
00:23:07,782 --> 00:23:09,957
I'm Thor. Son of Odin.

295
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:11,065
Really?

296
00:23:11,161 --> 00:23:13,266
You don't look like him.

297
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,696
Perhaps we can come
to an arrangement.

298
00:23:15,775 --> 00:23:17,607
You sound like him.

299
00:23:19,224 --> 00:23:20,920
Kneel.

300
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:23,032
Beg your pardon?

301
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:26,188
Kneel.

302
00:23:31,164 --> 00:23:33,179
For your queen.

303
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:35,776
I don't think so.

304
00:23:46,042 --> 00:23:47,891
That's not possible.

305
00:23:49,293 --> 00:23:53,324
Darling, you have no
idea what's possible.

306
00:24:13,138 --> 00:24:16,042
- Bring us back!
- No!

307
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,758
Loki!

308
00:25:10,918 --> 00:25:13,854
Who are you? What have
you done with Thor?

309
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:19,297
I'm Hela.

310
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,470
I'm just a janitor.

311
00:25:24,153 --> 00:25:28,626
You look like a smart boy
with good survival instincts.

312
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:33,130
How would you like a job?

313
00:27:40,704 --> 00:27:44,648
Are you a fighter?
Or are you food?

314
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,546
I'm just passing through.

315
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:50,295
It is food! On your knees.

316
00:28:31,715 --> 00:28:33,594
He's mine.

317
00:28:42,504 --> 00:28:44,382
Wait.

318
00:28:52,336 --> 00:28:53,449
Wait.

319
00:28:55,471 --> 00:29:00,320
He's mine. So if you want him,
you go through me.

320
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,598
But we've already got him.

321
00:29:03,323 --> 00:29:06,384
All right then. I guess
I go through you.

322
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:08,303
More food.

323
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,921
Thank you.

324
00:30:19,373 --> 00:30:23,322
Scrapper 142, I need clearance
and an audience with boss.

325
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:25,278
I've got someone special.

326
00:30:25,313 --> 00:30:28,247
Hey, where are you taking me?

327
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:30,319
Answer me!

328
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:35,265
Hey! I'm Thor, son of Odin. I
need to get back to Asgard.

329
00:30:35,308 --> 00:30:38,111
Many apologies, Your Majesty.

330
00:31:05,893 --> 00:31:09,809
It's come to my attention
that you don't know who I am.

331
00:31:16,651 --> 00:31:19,846
I am Hela. Odin's firstborn.

332
00:31:19,851 --> 00:31:22,653
Commander of the Legions of Asgard.

333
00:31:22,655 --> 00:31:26,670
The rightful heir to the throne
and the Goddess of Death.

334
00:31:30,575 --> 00:31:32,712
My father is dead.

335
00:31:32,752 --> 00:31:35,586
As are the princes.
You're welcome.

336
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:39,381
We were once the seat of
absolute power in the cosmos.

337
00:31:39,385 --> 00:31:44,525
Our supremacy was unchallenged.
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.

338
00:31:44,562 --> 00:31:49,246
Our destiny is to
rule over all others.

339
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:53,231
And I'm here to
restore that power.

340
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:55,218
Kneel before me.

341
00:31:55,253 --> 00:31:59,438
And rise to the ranks
of my great conquest.

342
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:08,051
Whoever you are, whatever you've done.
Surrender now, or we will show no mercy.

343
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:12,139
Whoever I am? Did you
listen to a word I've said?

344
00:32:12,148 --> 00:32:15,047
This is your last warning.

345
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,099
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

346
00:32:23,992 --> 00:32:25,904
Fine.

347
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:36,043
I missed this.

348
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,085
Still, it's a shame.

349
00:33:38,095 --> 00:33:40,164
Good soldiers dying for nothing.

350
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:42,976
All because they
couldn't see the future.

351
00:33:43,013 --> 00:33:45,015
Sad.

352
00:33:45,946 --> 00:33:48,018
Still alive.

353
00:33:54,923 --> 00:33:56,867
Change of heart?

354
00:33:56,902 --> 00:33:59,962
Go back to whatever chamber
you crept out of...

355
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,840
You evil demoness!

356
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:08,744
Let's go see my palace.

357
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,510
Fear not, for you are found.

358
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:45,435
You're home and there's
no going back.

359
00:34:47,348 --> 00:34:49,351
No one leaves this place.

360
00:34:49,394 --> 00:34:51,464
But what is this place?

361
00:34:51,474 --> 00:34:53,441
The answer is ..

362
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,147
Sakaar.

363
00:34:57,147 --> 00:34:59,185
Surrounded by cosmic gateways...

364
00:34:59,195 --> 00:35:02,153
Sakaar lives on the edge of
the known and unknown.

365
00:35:02,197 --> 00:35:06,178
It is the collection point for
all lost and unloved things.

366
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:07,300
Like you.

367
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:10,245
But here on Sakaar,
you are significant.

368
00:35:10,278 --> 00:35:14,005
You are valuable, cared, and loved.

369
00:35:14,008 --> 00:35:18,091
- What the hell?
- And no one loves you more than the Grandmaster.

370
00:35:18,132 --> 00:35:22,878
He's the original. The first
lost, and the first found.

371
00:35:22,882 --> 00:35:26,966
The creator of Sakaar, and father
of the Contest of Champions.

372
00:35:27,007 --> 00:35:31,756
For once you were nothing,
now you are something.

373
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:34,753
You are the property
of the Grandmaster.

374
00:35:34,796 --> 00:35:39,934
Congratulations, you will meet
the Grandmaster in 5 seconds.

375
00:35:39,942 --> 00:35:42,643
Prepare yourself.

376
00:35:43,637 --> 00:35:45,607
Prepare yourself.

377
00:35:46,574 --> 00:35:50,488
You are now meeting,
the Grandmaster.

378
00:36:02,445 --> 00:36:06,459
- He's wonderful. It is a he?
- It is a he.

379
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:10,551
I love it when you come to visit, 142.

380
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:18,352
You bring me just the best stuff. Whenever we get
to talking, Topaz, about 142, what do I always say?

381
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:20,980
- She is the, starts with a B...
- Trash.

382
00:36:21,124 --> 00:36:23,422
No. Not trash.

383
00:36:23,913 --> 00:36:26,239
Were you waiting to just call her that?

384
00:36:26,245 --> 00:36:28,841
- That doesnt start with a B.
- Boozehead.

385
00:36:29,777 --> 00:36:34,160
I'm sorry. No. Best. I
was thinking about best.

386
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:35,426
'Cause I always say
you're the best.

387
00:36:35,431 --> 00:36:37,394
She brought me my beloved
champion, you know.

388
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:40,388
- You say that everytime she's here.
- What have you brought today?

389
00:36:40,388 --> 00:36:45,687
- A contender.
- What? I need to go closer. I want a look at this.

390
00:36:45,808 --> 00:36:47,657
Can you take us
closer? Thank you.

391
00:36:59,674 --> 00:37:01,478
Pay this lady.

392
00:37:01,503 --> 00:37:05,683
Just wait a damn minute.
I'm not for sale.

393
00:37:11,811 --> 00:37:14,116
Man, he's a fighter.

394
00:37:14,142 --> 00:37:15,539
I'll take 10 million.

395
00:37:15,565 --> 00:37:19,102
- Tell her she's dreaming.
- For heaven's sakes. Transfer the units.

396
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:29,012
- You'll pay for this!
- No. I got paid for this.

397
00:37:29,896 --> 00:37:32,081
Here's what I want to know.

398
00:37:33,704 --> 00:37:40,130
- Who are you?
- I am the God of... Thunder!

399
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:44,154
I didn't hear any thunder,
but on your fingers...

400
00:37:44,198 --> 00:37:47,011
Is that, like, sparkles?

401
00:37:47,052 --> 00:37:50,248
- We've located your cousin.
- Uh... Oh, good!

402
00:37:50,256 --> 00:37:51,947
Yeah, come on.

403
00:37:51,987 --> 00:37:53,368
You're gonna like this.

404
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:56,079
There he is. Hey, cuz.

405
00:37:56,114 --> 00:37:58,176
It's been fun. Where
you been hiding?

406
00:37:58,213 --> 00:38:00,228
Hi.

407
00:38:00,775 --> 00:38:02,752
So...

408
00:38:05,162 --> 00:38:08,256
- Sorry.
- Carlo...

409
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:11,397
- I pardon you.
- Thank you.

410
00:38:12,169 --> 00:38:16,661
You're officially pardoned...
from life.

411
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,407
Oh my God!

412
00:38:26,777 --> 00:38:29,707
I'm stepping in it!
Look.

413
00:38:29,842 --> 00:38:32,788
- Oh, the smell.
- Wow!

414
00:38:32,845 --> 00:38:36,674
- What does it smell like?
- Baked toast.

415
00:38:37,188 --> 00:38:40,869
What happened to my manners. I
haven't properly introduced myself.

416
00:38:40,895 --> 00:38:43,002
Come on. Follow me.

417
00:38:43,013 --> 00:38:49,029
My name is Grandmaster. I preside
over the Contest of Champions.

418
00:38:49,073 --> 00:38:52,832
Skip that part, why I don't participate
in it and you, my friend...

419
00:38:52,857 --> 00:38:55,830
Have just been part of the cast.
What do you say to that?

420
00:38:55,862 --> 00:38:59,498
We're not friends and I don't give a shit
about your games. I'm going back to Asgard.

421
00:38:59,924 --> 00:39:03,970
Ass-guard?
1, 2, 3, 4.

422
00:39:07,371 --> 00:39:10,928
I let go.

423
00:39:11,873 --> 00:39:14,857
Loki? Loki!

424
00:39:14,902 --> 00:39:17,259
Loki. Over here.

425
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,036
Over here.

426
00:39:19,544 --> 00:39:21,137
Loki!

427
00:39:21,214 --> 00:39:23,931
What? You're alive?

428
00:39:24,003 --> 00:39:27,371
- Of course, I'm alive! What are you doing here?
- What do you mean, what I'm doing?

429
00:39:27,403 --> 00:39:29,708
I'm stuck in this stupid chair.
Where's your chair?

430
00:39:29,748 --> 00:39:31,194
- I didn't get a chair.
- Get me out of this one.

431
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:32,867
- I can't.
- Get me out!

432
00:39:32,876 --> 00:39:36,823
I didn't just come to this place
without getting his favor.

433
00:39:36,836 --> 00:39:39,810
- Plus, I've been out here weeks ago.
- Weeks ago?

434
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,963
- But I just got here.
- What are you wispering about?

435
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,945
I'm a hip dude around these parts.

436
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:49,330
On any other world, I'll be like, millions
of years old. But here on Sakaar...

437
00:39:52,714 --> 00:39:55,802
In any case...

438
00:39:55,845 --> 00:39:58,264
You know this...

439
00:39:58,337 --> 00:40:01,970
- You call yourself Lord of Thunder?
- God of Thunder. Tell him.

440
00:40:02,073 --> 00:40:04,028
I've never met this
man in my life.

441
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:05,802
- He's my brother!
- Adopted.

442
00:40:05,835 --> 00:40:09,073
- Is he any kind of a fighter?
- Take this thing off my neck. I'll show you.

443
00:40:09,098 --> 00:40:12,713
Listen to that. He's threatening me.
Hey, Sparkles! Here's the deal.

444
00:40:12,752 --> 00:40:15,713
- You wanna get back to Ass-place,  Ass-berg...
- Asgard!

445
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:19,861
Any contender who
defeats my champion...

446
00:40:19,908 --> 00:40:22,455
- Their freedom they shall win.
- Fine!

447
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,788
Then point me in the direction
of whoever's ass I have to kick.

448
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:30,479
That's what I call contender! The
direction would be this way, Lord.

449
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:31,823
Loki!

450
00:40:36,211 --> 00:40:39,757
Hey! Hey! Hey,
take it easy man.

451
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:43,673
Over here. Pile of
rocks waving at you.

452
00:40:43,706 --> 00:40:47,633
Naw, I'm actually a thing. I'm a being.
Allow me to introduce myself...

453
00:40:47,635 --> 00:40:50,791
My name is Korg. I'm kind of
like the leader in here...

454
00:40:50,832 --> 00:40:53,814
I'm made of rocks, as you can see,
but don't let that intimidate you.

455
00:40:53,825 --> 00:40:56,685
You don't need to be afraid
unless you're made of scissors.

456
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:02,611
Just a little rock, paper, scissor
joke for you. This is my friend Miek.

457
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,606
He's an insect and has
knives for hands.

458
00:41:05,608 --> 00:41:08,456
- You're a Kronnan, aren't you?
- That I am.

459
00:41:08,511 --> 00:41:10,344
How'd you end up in here?

460
00:41:10,376 --> 00:41:14,259
Well, I tried to start a revolution but
didn't print enough pamphlets, so...

461
00:41:14,284 --> 00:41:17,877
Hardly anyone turned up. Except for
my mum and her boyfriend who I hate.

462
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:23,439
As punishment, I was forced to be in here and be a
gladiator. Bit of a promotional disaster, that one.

463
00:41:23,484 --> 00:41:29,717
But I'm actually organizing another revolution.
Do you reckon you'd be interested?

464
00:41:31,743 --> 00:41:33,502
How did you...

465
00:41:33,536 --> 00:41:36,589
Yeah, no. This whole
thing is a circle.

466
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:39,559
But not a real circle.
More like a freaky circle.

467
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,577
- This doesn't make any sense.
- No, nothing makes sense here man.

468
00:41:42,588 --> 00:41:45,382
The only thing that does make
sense, is that nothing makes sense.

469
00:41:45,418 --> 00:41:48,030
Have anyone here fought the
Grandmaster's champion?

470
00:41:48,055 --> 00:41:48,938
Doug has.

471
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:52,471
Doug! Oh, right. Doug's dead.
That's right...

472
00:41:52,475 --> 00:41:55,457
Everyone who fights the
Grandmaster's champion perishes.

473
00:41:55,489 --> 00:41:57,455
What about you?
You're made of rocks.

474
00:41:57,466 --> 00:42:00,380
Perishable rock, eh.

475
00:42:00,432 --> 00:42:04,266
Yeah, no. I just do the smaller fights.
Warm up the crowd and whatnot.

476
00:42:04,339 --> 00:42:07,860
- Wait, you're not gonna face him, are you?
- Yes, I am.

477
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:11,653
I'm gonna fight him, win. Then
get the hell out of this place.

478
00:42:11,726 --> 00:42:15,448
That's exactly what Doug used to say.
See you later, New Doug.

479
00:42:23,378 --> 00:42:25,433
Does no one remember me?

480
00:42:25,469 --> 00:42:28,555
Has no one been
taught of history?

481
00:42:33,127 --> 00:42:35,182
Look at these lies.

482
00:42:35,207 --> 00:42:38,192
Goblets and garden parties?

483
00:42:39,225 --> 00:42:41,504
Peace treaties?

484
00:42:42,548 --> 00:42:45,600
Odin. Proud to have it...

485
00:42:45,672 --> 00:42:47,972
Shame now I've got it!

486
00:43:05,981 --> 00:43:07,960
We were unstoppable.

487
00:43:08,023 --> 00:43:13,169
I was his weapon in the conquest
that built Asgard's empire.

488
00:43:15,379 --> 00:43:18,908
One by one, the
Realms became ours.

489
00:43:18,939 --> 00:43:22,304
But then, simply
because my ambition

490
00:43:22,346 --> 00:43:25,278
outgrew his... He banished me.

491
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:28,292
Caged me. Locked me
away like an animal.

492
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:35,310
Before that, Asgard's warriors were honored. Their
bodies buried as heroes beneath this very palace.

493
00:43:46,155 --> 00:43:49,117
- Odin's treasures.
- Fake!

494
00:43:49,985 --> 00:43:52,677
Most of the stuff
in here is fake.

495
00:43:52,999 --> 00:43:55,019
Weak.

496
00:43:55,936 --> 00:43:58,267
Smaller than I thought it'd be.

497
00:43:59,618 --> 00:44:01,583
That's not bad.

498
00:44:01,899 --> 00:44:03,466
But this...

499
00:44:03,491 --> 00:44:06,613
The Eternal Flame.

500
00:44:33,721 --> 00:44:36,740
Want to see what true
power really looks like?

501
00:45:05,073 --> 00:45:09,167
Fenris, my darling. What
have they done to you?

502
00:45:10,147 --> 00:45:15,200
With the Eternal Flame,
you are reborn!

503
00:45:29,191 --> 00:45:32,085
I missed you.

504
00:45:32,231 --> 00:45:35,757
I missed you all.

505
00:45:37,558 --> 00:45:43,099
Odin, may you take your place
in the arms of Valhalla.

506
00:45:58,803 --> 00:46:01,611
Hurts, doesn't it?
Being lied to.

507
00:46:01,836 --> 00:46:05,899
Being told you're one thing, and
learning it's all a fiction.

508
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:14,811
You didn't think I'd really come and see
you, did you? This place is disgusting.

509
00:46:17,248 --> 00:46:19,143
Does this mean you
don't want my help?

510
00:46:19,187 --> 00:46:22,910
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my position with the
Grandmaster. It took me time to win his trust.

511
00:46:22,953 --> 00:46:25,034
He's a lunatic, but he
can be an awful one.

512
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:27,101
What I'm telling you
is, you can join me

513
00:46:27,149 --> 00:46:32,245
at the Grandmaster's side. Perhaps in time, an
accident befalls the Grandmaster, and then...

514
00:46:38,743 --> 00:46:40,967
You're not seriously thinking
of going back, are you?

515
00:46:43,783 --> 00:46:47,695
Our sister, destroyed your
hammer like a piece of glass.

516
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,972
She's stronger than both of us.

517
00:46:49,998 --> 00:46:53,980
She's stronger than you. You don't stand a chance.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

518
00:46:58,736 --> 00:46:59,808
Fine.

519
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:07,521
I guess I'll have to go it alone.
Like I've always done.

520
00:47:09,251 --> 00:47:11,235
Would you say something?

521
00:47:13,089 --> 00:47:14,819
Say something!

522
00:47:16,217 --> 00:47:18,976
What would you like me to say?

523
00:47:19,001 --> 00:47:21,056
You faked your own death.

524
00:47:21,268 --> 00:47:25,194
You stole the throne, stripped Odin of
his power, stranding him on Earth...

525
00:47:25,219 --> 00:47:26,086
to die.

526
00:47:26,118 --> 00:47:31,134
Releasing the Goddess of Death. Have I said enough? Would
you like me to go back further than the past 2 days?

527
00:47:32,156 --> 00:47:34,777
You know I haven't seen this...

528
00:47:34,816 --> 00:47:39,293
What I've heard of the Champion he talks
of? I've heard he's astonishingly savage.

529
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:44,220
I've placed a large wager against
you tomorrow. Don't let me down.

530
00:47:48,009 --> 00:47:49,972
Piss off, ghost!

531
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:53,828
He's freaking gone.

532
00:48:01,739 --> 00:48:02,735
Oh, yuck!

533
00:48:02,744 --> 00:48:05,403
This got so much hair and blood all over.
Disgusting.

534
00:48:05,428 --> 00:48:09,771
Could you clean up the weapons, once you've
finished your fight? Disgusting slobs!

535
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:11,613
Oh, Thor ..

536
00:48:11,965 --> 00:48:13,734
Want to use a big wooden fork?

537
00:48:14,664 --> 00:48:16,652
- No.
- Yeah, not really useful.

538
00:48:16,678 --> 00:48:20,295
Unless you were fighting off 3
vampires that were huddled together.

539
00:48:20,922 --> 00:48:22,480
No, I really wish
I had my hammer.

540
00:48:22,505 --> 00:48:24,449
- Hammer?
- It's unique.

541
00:48:24,474 --> 00:48:28,267
It's made from this special metal
from the heart of a dying star.

542
00:48:28,293 --> 00:48:31,559
And when I spun it really fast,
it gave me the ability to fly.

543
00:48:31,571 --> 00:48:33,464
- You rode the hammer?
- No. I...

544
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,760
I didn't ride the hammer.

545
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:38,456
- The hammer rode you on your back?
- No, I spin it really fast

546
00:48:38,491 --> 00:48:40,714
- and it pulled me off..
- Oh, my god.

547
00:48:40,747 --> 00:48:44,471
- The hammer pulled you off?
- The ground! Pulled me off the ground. Up to the air.

548
00:48:44,516 --> 00:48:47,667
And I would fly. Everytime I
threw it, it would always

549
00:48:47,707 --> 00:48:49,202
come back to me.

550
00:48:49,227 --> 00:48:55,220
Sounds like you had a special relationship with this
hammer and losing it felt like losing a loved one.

551
00:48:55,246 --> 00:48:57,367
That's a nice way of putting it.

552
00:48:59,206 --> 00:49:01,262
I said they're mine.

553
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:04,299
That's the one that
put me in here.

554
00:49:04,557 --> 00:49:08,227
Oh, yeah, Scrapper 142. Watch
out with those Asgardians, man.

555
00:49:08,253 --> 00:49:10,095
They are hard to push.

556
00:49:10,495 --> 00:49:12,052
Asgardian?

557
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:15,342
Hey! Hey!

558
00:49:16,424 --> 00:49:17,478
Hey.

559
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:21,149
Do not zap me with that thing!
I just want to talk.

560
00:49:21,265 --> 00:49:23,986
Asgard is in danger.

561
00:49:27,872 --> 00:49:29,689
My god, you are a Valkyrie.

562
00:49:29,746 --> 00:49:32,839
You know I used to wanna be a
Valkyrie when I was younger.

563
00:49:32,865 --> 00:49:36,406
Until I found out you were all women. There's
nothing wrong with women, of course.

564
00:49:36,441 --> 00:49:38,301
I love women.

565
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:42,289
Sometimes a little too much. Not in
a creepy way, more of a respectful

566
00:49:42,301 --> 00:49:46,225
appreciation. I think it's great
that there's an elite force of women

567
00:49:46,261 --> 00:49:48,648
warriors in our time.

568
00:49:50,142 --> 00:49:51,251
Are you done?

569
00:49:51,287 --> 00:49:52,410
Lord of Thunder! You're up!

570
00:49:52,417 --> 00:49:55,077
- Please help me. I need your help.
- Bye.

571
00:49:55,118 --> 00:49:59,088
Then you must be a traitor or a coward because
the Valkyrie are sworn to protect the throne.

572
00:50:00,366 --> 00:50:02,006
Listen closely, Your Majesty.

573
00:50:02,045 --> 00:50:05,972
This is Sakaar, not Asgard. And
I'm a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.

574
00:50:09,082 --> 00:50:10,137
Bring him in!

575
00:50:10,439 --> 00:50:13,267
And no one escapes this place.

576
00:50:13,293 --> 00:50:15,346
So you're gonna die anyway.

577
00:50:26,595 --> 00:50:30,741
Now don't you move. My hands aren't
as steady as they used to be.

578
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:37,692
By Odin's beard you shall not cut my hair,
lest you feel the wrath of the Mighty Thor!

579
00:50:41,267 --> 00:50:44,320
Please... Please kind
sir, don't cut my hair.

580
00:50:44,616 --> 00:50:48,473
Please... No! No!

581
00:51:01,837 --> 00:51:04,889
Great show! What a night!

582
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:07,066
Please.

583
00:51:07,111 --> 00:51:15,030
I'm your host. Big round of applause for all the
competitors who today, died so gruesomely.

584
00:51:17,129 --> 00:51:22,492
What a show! What a night! This is
what you've come for, and so have I.

585
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:33,400
And now, without further
ado, it's main event time.

586
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:38,144
Making his first appearance...

587
00:51:44,302 --> 00:51:48,787
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...
Lord of Thunder.

588
00:52:11,683 --> 00:52:14,478
Watch out for his fingers.
They make sparkles.

589
00:52:27,171 --> 00:52:30,990
He is a creature--- what
can you say about him?

590
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:35,974
Well, he's unique. There's nothing like
him. I feel a sexual connection with him.

591
00:52:37,562 --> 00:52:39,544
He is undefeated...

592
00:52:40,466 --> 00:52:42,485
He's the reigning...

593
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,993
He's the defending...

594
00:52:47,738 --> 00:52:50,882
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you...

595
00:52:54,792 --> 00:53:00,110
Your, Incredible...

596
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,168
Yes!!!

597
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,776
I have to get off this planet.

598
00:53:11,803 --> 00:53:14,913
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?

599
00:53:22,581 --> 00:53:26,476
Hey! Hey! We know each other!

600
00:53:26,501 --> 00:53:29,057
He's a friend from work!

601
00:53:36,472 --> 00:53:41,270
Where have you been?
Everybody thought you were dead.

602
00:53:41,295 --> 00:53:45,148
So much has happened since I last saw you.
I lost my hammer.

603
00:53:45,228 --> 00:53:49,804
Like yesterday, so that's
still pretty fresh. Loki...

604
00:53:49,877 --> 00:53:54,850
Loki's alive. Can you believe it?
He's up there. Loki! Look who it is!

605
00:53:56,881 --> 00:53:59,461
Oh, Banner, I'd never thought
I'd say this, but I...

606
00:53:59,511 --> 00:54:02,338
I'm happy to see you.

607
00:54:09,144 --> 00:54:12,966
Banner! Hey, Banner!

608
00:54:13,264 --> 00:54:15,708
No Banner! Only Hulk!

609
00:54:16,022 --> 00:54:17,509
What are you doing?

610
00:54:17,535 --> 00:54:19,295
It's me...

611
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,511
Thor!

612
00:54:39,343 --> 00:54:43,268
Banner, we're friends. This is crazy.
I don't want to hurt you.

613
00:54:49,708 --> 00:54:51,864
Here we go. Here we go.

614
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,156
What?

615
00:55:22,299 --> 00:55:24,903
Hey, big guy.

616
00:55:25,709 --> 00:55:27,902
The sun's getting real low...

617
00:55:38,712 --> 00:55:41,276
That's it. Sun's going down.

618
00:55:43,759 --> 00:55:47,707
I don't want to hurt you anymore.
No one will.

619
00:55:59,575 --> 00:56:02,629
Yes! That's how it feels!

620
00:56:02,898 --> 00:56:05,793
I'm just a huge fan
of this sport.

621
00:56:13,061 --> 00:56:15,954
All right... Screw it.

622
00:56:26,225 --> 00:56:29,187
I know you're in there, Banner.
I'll get you out.

623
00:56:38,278 --> 00:56:42,382
That's enough. You're embarassing me.
I told them we were friends!

624
00:58:10,909 --> 00:58:15,924
Thunder! Thunder!

625
00:58:15,949 --> 00:58:21,001
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

626
00:58:21,026 --> 00:58:25,042
Thunder! Thunder!

627
00:58:25,067 --> 00:58:32,854
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

628
00:58:53,631 --> 00:58:56,649
Another day, another Doug.

629
00:59:04,058 --> 00:59:06,814
What is that noise?

630
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:10,392
The common folk aren't
exactly falling in line.

631
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,089
There's a resistance trying to
knock down the front gates.

632
00:59:19,037 --> 00:59:22,000
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.

633
00:59:22,002 --> 00:59:24,643
Well, my dad was a stonemason,

634
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:29,482
Yeah, I'll stop you there. What I
meant was, what's your ambition?

635
00:59:30,944 --> 00:59:34,472
I just want a chance
to prove myself.

636
00:59:34,987 --> 00:59:40,397
Recognized. When I was young, every
great king had an executioner.

637
00:59:40,469 --> 00:59:46,251
Not just to execute people, but
also to execute their vision.

638
00:59:47,279 --> 00:59:52,976
But mainly, to execute people.
Still, it was a great honor.

639
00:59:55,081 --> 01:00:02,788
I was Odin's executioner. And
you shall be my executioner.

640
01:00:08,108 --> 01:00:11,263
Let's begin our conquest.

641
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,843
Skurge, where's the sword?

642
01:00:28,455 --> 01:00:32,105
The sword is the key
to opening the Bifrost.

643
01:00:32,258 --> 01:00:35,769
Those people you mentioned, the
ones who aren't falling in line.

644
01:00:36,453 --> 01:00:38,559
Round them up.

645
01:00:59,595 --> 01:01:01,717
Go on.

646
01:01:15,782 --> 01:01:18,684
Sorry about that, these
bloody things are everywhere.

647
01:01:18,805 --> 01:01:20,598
Come on.

648
01:01:54,981 --> 01:01:57,068
You will be safe here.

649
01:03:03,948 --> 01:03:06,842
Are we cool?

650
01:03:09,468 --> 01:03:12,454
Hulk in a hot tub.

651
01:03:13,084 --> 01:03:16,170
- So how long have you been like that?
- Like what?

652
01:03:16,347 --> 01:03:19,764
Like this. Big, green, stupid.

653
01:03:19,972 --> 01:03:22,818
Hulk always Hulk.

654
01:03:26,937 --> 01:03:28,938
How did you get here?

655
01:03:29,895 --> 01:03:32,310
- Winning.
- You mean cheating?

656
01:03:32,336 --> 01:03:35,139
Do they wear one of these?
When you won?

657
01:03:35,165 --> 01:03:37,760
How did you arrive here?

658
01:03:39,865 --> 01:03:43,795
- Quinjet.
- Yes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?

659
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:52,344
Ah, that's naked.
That's very naked.

660
01:03:55,422 --> 01:03:58,607
That's in my brain now.

661
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,454
Quinjet.

662
01:04:09,642 --> 01:04:13,500
Yes, I'm getting us out of here.

663
01:04:13,597 --> 01:04:17,624
This is terrible.
You'll love Asgard.

664
01:04:17,649 --> 01:04:21,515
- It's big, golden, shiny.
- Hulk stay.

665
01:04:21,748 --> 01:04:24,955
No. My people need me
to get back to Asgard.

666
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:28,708
- We must prevent Ragnarok.
- Ragnarok?

667
01:04:28,733 --> 01:04:33,266
Prophesied death of my homeworld.
The end of days. End of everything.

668
01:04:33,412 --> 01:04:36,065
If you help me to
get back to Asgard,

669
01:04:36,233 --> 01:04:40,316
- I can help you get back to earth.
- Earth hate Hulk.

670
01:04:40,373 --> 01:04:44,252
Earth loves Hulk. They love you. You're
one of the Avengers, one of the team.

671
01:04:44,278 --> 01:04:46,881
That's what friends do,
support each other.

672
01:04:46,913 --> 01:04:51,109
- You're Banner's friend.
- I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you.

673
01:04:51,182 --> 01:04:53,464
- Banner's friend.
- I don't even like Banner.

674
01:04:53,496 --> 01:04:55,763
I mean, the numbers,
and science and stuff.

675
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:59,206
- Thor go, Hulk stay.
- Fine.

676
01:04:59,351 --> 01:05:03,797
Stay here. Stupid place.
It's hideous, by the way.

677
01:05:03,829 --> 01:05:08,810
The red and the white?
Just pick a color. Ridiculous.

678
01:05:08,866 --> 01:05:11,631
- Smash you.
- You didn't smash anything.

679
01:05:11,678 --> 01:05:13,560
- I won that fight.
- I smash you.

680
01:05:13,592 --> 01:05:15,899
- Yeah. Sure.
- Baby arms.

681
01:05:15,932 --> 01:05:20,915
- What?
- Baby! Thor go.

682
01:05:26,538 --> 01:05:29,086
Thor go again.

683
01:05:32,121 --> 01:05:34,241
Thor home.

684
01:05:43,801 --> 01:05:47,114
- Hulk trains.
- Great. Have fun.

685
01:05:47,186 --> 01:05:50,190
- Hey, big guy.
- Hey, little girl.

686
01:05:50,275 --> 01:05:52,785
- What are you up to?
- Winning.

687
01:06:02,034 --> 01:06:05,688
Heimdall, I know you can see me.

688
01:06:05,749 --> 01:06:09,696
I need you to help me.

689
01:06:09,721 --> 01:06:13,546
Help me see.

690
01:06:21,862 --> 01:06:24,914
I see you, but you're far away.

691
01:06:24,948 --> 01:06:28,177
- What's going on here?
- Come see for yourself.

692
01:06:30,216 --> 01:06:35,933
I provided refuge in a
stronghold built by ancestors.

693
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:37,658
Our only escape is Bifrost.

694
01:06:37,683 --> 01:06:40,455
You're talking about
evacuating Asgard?

695
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,410
We won't last long if we stay.

696
01:06:45,435 --> 01:06:49,483
She draws her power from Asgard and
grows stronger every day. Come on!

697
01:06:53,329 --> 01:06:58,307
Hela is madness. If I let her live, she'll
consume Nine Realms and all the cosmos.

698
01:06:58,375 --> 01:07:01,901
- We need you.
- I'm working on it, I don't even know where I am.

699
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:04,607
You're on a planet surrounded by doorways.
Go thru one.

700
01:07:04,632 --> 01:07:07,380
- Which one?
- The big one.

701
01:07:34,479 --> 01:07:37,597
- Thor sad.
- Shut up.

702
01:07:39,554 --> 01:07:42,411
Thor sad!

703
01:07:42,436 --> 01:07:44,424
I'm not sad. Idiot.

704
01:07:44,756 --> 01:07:46,938
I'm pissed off.

705
01:07:46,994 --> 01:07:50,368
Angry. I lost my father.

706
01:07:50,408 --> 01:07:52,895
I lost my hammer.

707
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:56,591
- Whine. Whine.
- You're not even listening!

708
01:07:56,749 --> 01:08:02,182
- Stop kick stuff!
- You're being a very bad friend!

709
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:04,987
- You bad friend.
- Do you know what we call you?

710
01:08:05,013 --> 01:08:09,399
- We call you the stupid Avenger.
- You tiny Avenger!

711
01:08:12,123 --> 01:08:14,235
- What are you, crazy?
- Yes.

712
01:08:14,279 --> 01:08:18,081
You know what? Earth
does hate you.

713
01:08:42,022 --> 01:08:45,106
Sorry that I said those things.

714
01:08:45,131 --> 01:08:49,145
You are not the stupid Avenger,
nobody calls you that.

715
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:51,029
It's okay.

716
01:08:51,064 --> 01:08:53,827
You just can't go around throwing
shields at people. You'll kill them.

717
01:08:53,859 --> 01:08:59,054
I know. It's just I get so angry
all the time. Always angry.

718
01:08:59,156 --> 01:09:03,275
We're the same. Just a couple
of hot-headed fools.

719
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:08,262
Yes, same. Hulk like fire.
Thor like water.

720
01:09:08,673 --> 01:09:12,688
- We're kinda both like fire.
- But Hulk like real fire.

721
01:09:13,705 --> 01:09:20,521
Hulk like raging fire.
Thor like smoldering fire.

722
01:09:20,588 --> 01:09:24,343
Hulk, I need you to
do something for me.

723
01:09:27,919 --> 01:09:31,036
Hey, little girl.

724
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:41,667
What's going on?
What are you...

725
01:09:49,634 --> 01:09:54,695
You're so thickheaded that you can't tell when someone
hiding across the universe wants to be left alone.

726
01:09:54,824 --> 01:09:57,862
- We need to talk.
- No, you won't talk to me.

727
01:09:57,862 --> 01:10:00,899
- I need her to stay here.
- Done.

728
01:10:03,542 --> 01:10:07,591
- Stay. Please?
- Please.

729
01:10:10,016 --> 01:10:12,040
All right.

730
01:10:12,044 --> 01:10:15,078
Here's the deal.

731
01:10:15,079 --> 01:10:17,104
I'll listen to you,

732
01:10:17,104 --> 01:10:20,140
until this is empty.

733
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:25,199
Asgard is in danger. People are dying, we
need to get back there. I need your help.

734
01:10:26,213 --> 01:10:28,238
Finished. Bye.

735
01:10:30,261 --> 01:10:32,285
Odin is dead.

736
01:10:34,311 --> 01:10:37,347
Hela, the goddess of
death, has invaded Asgard.

737
01:10:37,348 --> 01:10:42,409
- If Hela's back, then Asgard's already lost.
- I'm going to stop her.

738
01:10:43,418 --> 01:10:45,445
- Alone?
- Nope. I'm putting together a team.

739
01:10:45,445 --> 01:10:51,516
- It's me, you, and the big guy.
- No, no team! Only Hulk.

740
01:10:51,517 --> 01:10:55,565
- It's me and you.
- I think it's only you.

741
01:10:55,565 --> 01:10:59,616
The Valkyrie are a legend. Elite warriors
of Asgard, sworn to defend the throne.

742
01:10:59,616 --> 01:11:02,652
I'm not getting dragged into another
one of Odin's family squabbles.

743
01:11:02,653 --> 01:11:04,677
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your sister.

744
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:10,759
Her power comes from Asgard, same as yours. But grew beyond Odin's
control, she massacred everyone to try to seize the throne.

745
01:11:10,759 --> 01:11:14,809
When she tried to escape her banishment,
he sent the Valkyrie to fight her back.

746
01:11:15,821 --> 01:11:19,869
I only survived because...

747
01:11:19,869 --> 01:11:22,907
Look, I've already faced her once
back when I believed in the throne.

748
01:11:22,907 --> 01:11:25,944
It cost me everything. That's
what's wrong with Asgard.

749
01:11:25,944 --> 01:11:31,003
- The throne, the secrets, the whole golden sham.
- I agree.

750
01:11:31,005 --> 01:11:35,052
- Don't get familiar.
- I agree.

751
01:11:35,052 --> 01:11:40,112
That's why I turned down the throne. This
isn't about the crown. This is about the people.

752
01:11:40,113 --> 01:11:42,138
And they're dying, and
they're your people, too.

753
01:11:42,138 --> 01:11:44,163
Forget it.

754
01:11:44,163 --> 01:11:49,222
- I have.
- Okay. Good.

755
01:11:49,223 --> 01:11:52,260
- Thank you. For this.
- For what?

756
01:11:54,283 --> 01:11:56,310
You didn't see
that, did you?

757
01:11:56,310 --> 01:12:00,356
Well...

758
01:12:00,358 --> 01:12:06,431
Go ahead. Stay here and enslave
people for that lunatic.

759
01:12:06,432 --> 01:12:08,455
Keep drinking.
Keep hiding.

760
01:12:08,456 --> 01:12:14,538
Me, I choose to run toward my
problems, and not away from them.

761
01:12:15,550 --> 01:12:17,575
That's what---

762
01:12:21,624 --> 01:12:24,659
Because that's what heroes do.

763
01:12:35,793 --> 01:12:37,820
Friend, stay!

764
01:12:48,953 --> 01:12:50,976
Yes!

765
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:13,246
Come on ..

766
01:13:13,246 --> 01:13:16,282

Damn you, Stark.
Point Break.

773
01:13:35,523 --> 01:13:37,550
Welcome,
Point Break.

774
01:13:39,573 --> 01:13:44,632
- Friend, stay!
- No, no. Don't!

775
01:13:44,635 --> 01:13:48,681
- Stay!
- No, stop breaking everything.

776
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:53,510
Nice work, big guy.

777
01:13:53,574 --> 01:13:59,647
We don't know where Ultron's headed but you're going high
very fast, so I need you to turn this bird around, ok?

778
01:14:00,096 --> 01:14:02,122
We can't track you
in stealth mode, so,

779
01:14:02,179 --> 01:14:05,215
I need you to
help me out, okay?

780
01:14:07,913 --> 01:14:09,939
I need you...

781
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:29,180
Hulk very bad!

782
01:14:34,593 --> 01:14:38,641
- What's this?
- Banner?

783
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:43,536
Are you all right? Banner?

784
01:14:45,369 --> 01:14:49,428
The sun's going down.
That's it. Breathe.

785
01:14:49,428 --> 01:14:54,596
- I won't hurt you. Sun's going down..
- Thor...

786
01:14:55,499 --> 01:14:58,536
- What happened to your hair?
- Some creepy old man cut it off.

787
01:14:58,536 --> 01:15:01,573
It looks good.
Where are we?

788
01:15:01,574 --> 01:15:05,621
- How's Nat?
- Uh, Nat is good.

789
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:07,979
- And what about Sokovia?
- Sokovia?

790
01:15:08,006 --> 01:15:10,630
- The city, Sokovia, did we save it?
- Banner, listen...

791
01:15:10,681 --> 01:15:13,294
- What?
- Sokovia, Ultron, that was 2 years ago.

792
01:15:13,518 --> 01:15:16,081
What are you saying?

793
01:15:16,755 --> 01:15:20,269
- I've been Hulk for 2 years?
- I'm afraid so.

794
01:15:25,866 --> 01:15:28,901
What the hell happened?

795
01:15:30,925 --> 01:15:32,959
Banner, there's something
you should know.

796
01:15:34,974 --> 01:15:37,000
- Voice activation required.
- Banner.

797
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,033
- Welcome, Strongest Avenger.
- Uh, what?

798
01:15:39,033 --> 01:15:43,073
Ship's log.

799
01:15:52,184 --> 01:15:54,217
- Thor, where are we?
- Yeah, about that...

800
01:15:54,217 --> 01:16:01,300
Sakaar. Hear ye. Attention, please. I have some
bad news. My beloved champion has gone missing.

801
01:16:01,301 --> 01:16:03,327
Take to the streets.
Celebrate my champion.

802
01:16:04,337 --> 01:16:05,352
- Who's that?
- He kind of runs the place.

803
01:16:05,352 --> 01:16:08,388
You actually lived in
his house for a while.

804
01:16:08,388 --> 01:16:09,400
- I did?
- Yeah.

805
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,436
Quite a lot has happened. You
and I had a fight recently.

806
01:16:12,436 --> 01:16:14,461
- Did I win?
- No, I won. Easy.

807
01:16:14,461 --> 01:16:16,485
- That doesn't sound right.
- Well, it's true.

808
01:16:16,486 --> 01:16:21,546
It seems that that seductive Lord
of Thunder has stolen him away...

809
01:16:21,546 --> 01:16:24,583
Seductive God of Thunder.
We have to go.

810
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:32,679
This is bad. This
is really, really bad.

811
01:16:33,694 --> 01:16:35,718
Thor.

812
01:16:36,728 --> 01:16:40,777
- I think I'm freaking out.
- No, don't freak out.

813
01:16:40,777 --> 01:16:43,814
- You're okay. Put these on.
- These are Tony's clothes. Is he here?

814
01:16:43,814 --> 01:16:47,872
No, he's not here. Listen, you stay
calm, okay? The sun's going down.

815
01:16:47,873 --> 01:16:49,897
The sun's going down.

816
01:16:55,971 --> 01:16:59,008
I'm upset.

817
01:17:01,032 --> 01:17:05,079
I'm very upset. Do you know
what I like about being upset?

818
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:09,129
Blame. And now that's the mindset that
I'm in. And you know who I'm blaming?

819
01:17:09,129 --> 01:17:12,165
- Grandmaster, I ..
- Hey, don't interrupt me.

820
01:17:12,165 --> 01:17:16,213
Why are you handing
me the melt stick?

821
01:17:16,214 --> 01:17:20,262
He was interrupting. That's
not a capital violation.

822
01:17:20,262 --> 01:17:23,301
Where was I? My precious
champion has gone missing.

823
01:17:23,301 --> 01:17:26,335
And it's all because of
that Lord of Thunder.

824
01:17:26,335 --> 01:17:28,359
It's all because of
him, your brother.

825
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:32,411
Whatever the story is. Adopted or
complicated. I'm sure there's a history.

826
01:17:32,411 --> 01:17:34,436
And your contender.

827
01:17:35,445 --> 01:17:39,494
My dear friend, if you were to give me 12
hours, I can bring them both back to you alive.

828
01:17:39,494 --> 01:17:41,520
I can do it in 2.

829
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:44,555
- I can do it in one.
- Let's stop there.

830
01:17:44,555 --> 01:17:47,593
You know what, I woke up this morning
thinking about public execution.

831
01:17:48,605 --> 01:17:52,663
But for now, I'll settle
for this sweet little...

832
01:17:53,674 --> 01:17:56,712
So, you're on the clock.

833
01:17:57,725 --> 01:18:00,753
- What have you done?
- I don't answer to you, Lackey.

834
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:03,799
It's Loki, and you will
answer to the Grandmaster.

835
01:18:05,824 --> 01:18:08,860
Why would you help my brother
escape with that green fool?

836
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:11,894
I don't help anyone.

837
01:18:17,967 --> 01:18:19,993
You are a Valkyrie.

838
01:18:24,041 --> 01:18:27,077
I thought the Valkyrie have
all died gruesome deaths.

839
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:29,102
Choose your next
words wisely.

840
01:18:29,102 --> 01:18:34,162
I'm terribly sorry, must've
been a very painful memory.

841
01:19:24,783 --> 01:19:30,858
The sun's going down,
the sun's really low...

842
01:19:30,858 --> 01:19:33,892
- The sun's going down...
- Would you stop saying that?

843
01:19:33,892 --> 01:19:34,904
I just need you
to stay calm.

844
01:19:34,904 --> 01:19:38,953
- Calm? I'm on an alien planet.
- It's just a planet, you've been to one before.

845
01:19:38,954 --> 01:19:43,002
- Yeah! One!
- Well, now you've been on two! That's a good thing.

846
01:19:43,002 --> 01:19:48,062
- A new experience.
- My neurons, they're firing faster than my brain can handle the information...

847
01:19:48,063 --> 01:19:50,088
The whole thing is
totally different this time.

848
01:19:50,089 --> 01:19:57,173
I mean, in the past when I was Hulk, I had a hand on the wheel,
but this time he had the keys and I was locked in the trunk!

849
01:19:57,174 --> 01:19:59,198
You're back now and
that's all that matters.

850
01:19:59,198 --> 01:20:04,268
No, it's not what matters. What I'm trying to tell you is
that if I turn into the Hulk again, Banner may not come back.

851
01:20:04,268 --> 01:20:07,306
And we're stranded in a planet
that is designed to stress me out.

852
01:20:07,306 --> 01:20:11,353
We are not stranded, I'm gonna
figure out a way to get us home.

853
01:20:11,353 --> 01:20:13,379
- Thank you.
- Not your home, though. Asgard.

854
01:20:13,379 --> 01:20:15,401
- My home.
- What?

855
01:20:15,402 --> 01:20:21,476
Listen, my people are in grave danger. You and I have to
fight this powerful being who happens to be my sister.

856
01:20:21,477 --> 01:20:25,524
Okay, that is so wrong on so many...
I don't wanna fight your sister.

857
01:20:25,524 --> 01:20:26,536
- That's a family issue.
- She's an evil being.

858
01:20:27,551 --> 01:20:31,597
I don't care what she is. I'm not fighting
any more beings. I'm sick of it.

859
01:20:31,597 --> 01:20:36,660
I just told you. If I turn into the Hulk,
I am never gonna come back again.

860
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:39,696
- And you don't care!
- No, I'm putting together a team.

861
01:20:39,697 --> 01:20:40,709
Hulk is the fire.

862
01:20:40,709 --> 01:20:44,756
- Wait, you're just using me to get to the Hulk.
- What? No!

863
01:20:44,757 --> 01:20:46,781
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.

864
01:20:46,781 --> 01:20:51,842
No. I don't even like the Hulk.
He's like.... Smash, smash!

865
01:20:51,842 --> 01:20:53,868
I prefer you.

866
01:20:53,868 --> 01:20:55,890
Thanks.

867
01:20:55,890 --> 01:21:00,951
But honestly when it comes to fighting evil
beings, he is very powerful and useful.

868
01:21:00,951 --> 01:21:02,985
- Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.
- Is he, though?

869
01:21:02,985 --> 01:21:06,013
Okay, how many PhD's
does Hulk have? Zero.

870
01:21:06,013 --> 01:21:09,050
How many PhD's does
Banner have? Seven.

871
01:21:09,050 --> 01:21:13,108
Fine, you don't have to fight anyone. But
we're in danger here, so let's get on it.

872
01:21:16,144 --> 01:21:18,169
- What are you doing with that?
- I need a disguise. I'm a fugitive.

873
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:21,205
- I need a disguise.
- You are in disguise.

874
01:21:21,205 --> 01:21:23,229
- I'll be Tony Stark.
- What?

875
01:21:23,229 --> 01:21:25,254
Yeah, Tony and the gypsy.

876
01:21:25,254 --> 01:21:27,279
No, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce Banner.

877
01:21:27,279 --> 01:21:29,302
Then why did you
dress me up like Tony?

878
01:21:29,303 --> 01:21:30,315
Because you were naked.

879
01:21:30,315 --> 01:21:32,339
Okay, I'll give you that.

880
01:21:32,339 --> 01:21:35,376
- What are you doing? Stop doing that.
- Sorry. Tony wears his pants super tight.

881
01:21:35,376 --> 01:21:37,401
Why are you
being so weird?

882
01:21:37,401 --> 01:21:41,449
I don't know, maybe the fact
that I was trapped for 2 years...

883
01:21:41,449 --> 01:21:43,475
inside of a monster
made me a little weird!

884
01:21:43,476 --> 01:21:46,511
Hey... it's okay.
Look...

885
01:21:46,511 --> 01:21:52,583
Calm down... come on. We'll go to Asgard, and you
don't worry about being the Hulk ever again.

886
01:21:52,583 --> 01:21:54,609
- All right?
- All right.

887
01:22:00,682 --> 01:22:03,718
Oh, this is bad...

888
01:22:06,756 --> 01:22:09,791
Banner!
Banner!

889
01:22:11,825 --> 01:22:13,841
Banner!

890
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:30,046
- Banner!
- Thor!

891
01:22:41,179 --> 01:22:43,204
- Hi.
- Hi.

892
01:22:43,204 --> 01:22:46,240
- I was gonna do that.
- I did it first.

893
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:48,265
Good. What are you doing here?

894
01:22:48,265 --> 01:22:50,289
What are you doing here?
I thought you were leaving.

895
01:22:50,289 --> 01:22:52,314
I got sidetracked.

896
01:22:52,314 --> 01:22:55,349
- What's with the...?
- This is my disguise.

897
01:22:55,349 --> 01:22:59,397
- I can see your face.
- Not when I do this, you can't.

898
01:22:59,398 --> 01:23:03,448
Looks like you can help me.
Do you want to help us?

899
01:23:08,509 --> 01:23:12,559
What's are those things on her eyes? Are those
people that she's killed? So beautiful and strong...

900
01:23:12,559 --> 01:23:14,583
- Who is this guy?
- A friend.

901
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:16,608
- I'm Bruce.
- I feel like I know you.

902
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:18,640
I feel like I know you, too.

903
01:23:22,689 --> 01:23:26,738
Look, I spent years in a haze,
trying to forget my past.

904
01:23:26,738 --> 01:23:30,786
Sakaar seemed like the best place to
drink and forget and to die one day.

905
01:23:30,786 --> 01:23:33,823
I was thinking if you drink too much,
that's probably what's gonna kill you.

906
01:23:33,824 --> 01:23:35,849
- I don't plan to stop drinking.
- Oh.

907
01:23:35,849 --> 01:23:38,884
But I don't wanna forget. I
can't run away anymore.

908
01:23:38,884 --> 01:23:44,959
So if I'm gonna die, it may as well be driving
my sword thru the heart of that murderous hag.

909
01:23:44,959 --> 01:23:46,983
Good. Yeah.

910
01:23:46,983 --> 01:23:51,030
So I'm saying that I
wanna be on the team.

911
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:55,079
- Has it got a name?
- Yeah, it's called the... Revengers.

912
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:59,130
- Revengers?
- Because I'm getting revenge. You're getting revenge.

913
01:23:59,130 --> 01:24:04,191
- You're... do you want revenge?
- I'm.... undecided.

914
01:24:04,192 --> 01:24:09,251
Also, I've got a
peace offering.

915
01:24:11,275 --> 01:24:14,311
Surprise!

916
01:24:19,381 --> 01:24:22,410
Had to be sure.

917
01:24:25,446 --> 01:24:27,471
Hello, Bruce.

918
01:24:27,472 --> 01:24:31,529
So, the last time I saw you, you were trying to
kill everybody. Where are you at these days?

919
01:24:32,532 --> 01:24:34,566
It varies from
moment to moment.

920
01:24:34,566 --> 01:24:40,637
- Is that a Dragon Fang? Oh, my God!
- It is.

921
01:24:40,637 --> 01:24:41,652
The famed sword
of the Valkyrie.

922
01:24:41,653 --> 01:24:45,699
So, Sakaar and Asgard are about
as far apart as a system, our best bet

923
01:24:45,699 --> 01:24:48,735
is a wormhole just
outside the city limits.

924
01:24:48,735 --> 01:24:51,774
Refuel on Xandar and we can
be back in Asgard in, 18 months?

925
01:24:51,774 --> 01:24:55,821
Nope. We are going
through the big one.

926
01:24:55,821 --> 01:24:58,856
- The Devil's Anus?
- Anus?

927
01:24:58,856 --> 01:25:01,895
- Wait, whose anus?
- For the record, I didn't know it was called that when I picked it.

928
01:25:01,895 --> 01:25:05,943
That looks like a Clapton Neutron star
inside of an Einstein-Rosen bridge.

929
01:25:05,944 --> 01:25:08,980
We need another ship. That
will tear mine to pieces.

930
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:12,018
She's right. We need one that can withstand
the geode that stray from singularities.

931
01:25:12,018 --> 01:25:16,719
And has an offline power steering system
that can function without a computer.

932
01:25:16,752 --> 01:25:20,116
And we need one with cupholders
because we're gonna die, so... drinks!

933
01:25:20,116 --> 01:25:24,164
- Do I know you? I feel like I know you.
- I feel like I know you, too. It's weird.

934
01:25:24,165 --> 01:25:30,245
What do you say? Uncharted intergalactic travel
wormhole cosmic gateway? Talk about adventure.

935
01:25:30,245 --> 01:25:33,273
- We need a ship.
- Two ships.

936
01:25:33,273 --> 01:25:36,319
- Have to look top of the line models.
- I don't mean to impose...

937
01:25:38,335 --> 01:25:40,369
But the Grandmaster has
a great many ships.

938
01:25:40,369 --> 01:25:44,416
I may even have stolen the access
codes to his security system.

939
01:25:44,416 --> 01:25:46,442
And suddenly you're overcome
with the urge to do the right thing?

940
01:25:46,442 --> 01:25:49,478
Heavens, no. I've run out of
favor with the Grandmaster...

941
01:25:49,479 --> 01:25:55,551
In exchange for codes and access to a ship,
I'm asking for safe passage. Thru the Anus.

942
01:25:55,551 --> 01:26:00,611
So you can get us access to the
garage without setting off the alarms?

943
01:26:00,611 --> 01:26:01,624
Yes, brother. I can.

944
01:26:01,625 --> 01:26:04,662
Okay, can I just...
A quick FYI?

945
01:26:04,662 --> 01:26:09,721
I was just talking to him and
he was ready to kill any of us.

946
01:26:09,721 --> 01:26:12,758
- He did try to kill me.
- Yes, me too. Many, many occasions.

947
01:26:12,758 --> 01:26:17,819
One time when we're children, he transformed into a snake,
and he knows I love snakes, so I went to admire it...

948
01:26:17,819 --> 01:26:23,892
And he transformed back to himself, and
he's like, "It's me!" And he stabbed me.

949
01:26:23,892 --> 01:26:25,917
We were 8 at the time.

950
01:26:25,917 --> 01:26:28,954
If we're boosting a ship, we're gonna need
to draw some guards away from the palace.

951
01:26:28,954 --> 01:26:29,974
Why not set the beast loose?

952
01:26:30,977 --> 01:26:33,002
- Shhh. Shut up.
- He said a beast?

953
01:26:33,002 --> 01:26:35,036
There's no beast.
He's just being stupid.

954
01:26:35,036 --> 01:26:37,061
- We're gonna start a revolution.
- Revolution?

955
01:26:37,061 --> 01:26:40,088
- I'll explain later.
- Who is this guy again?

956
01:26:40,088 --> 01:26:42,113
I'll explain later.

957
01:26:42,121 --> 01:26:47,184
Is it some sort of protoplasm, all
the stuff coming out of you or eggs?

958
01:26:48,195 --> 01:26:50,219
It looks like eggs.

959
01:26:51,232 --> 01:26:54,267
Ooh!

960
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:01,355
- I'm looking for Korg.
- Who's asking?

961
01:27:01,355 --> 01:27:05,403
I know you're asking. Is
anyone else asking or just you?

962
01:27:05,403 --> 01:27:08,440
The Lord of Thunder
sends his best.

963
01:27:11,475 --> 01:27:13,500
The revolution has begun!

964
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:15,525
Revolution?
How did this happen?

965
01:27:15,525 --> 01:27:22,609
Don't know. But the arena's mainframe for the obedience disks are deactivated and the slaves have armed themselves.

966
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:26,658
- Oh, I don't like that word.
- Mainframe?

967
01:27:26,659 --> 01:27:30,708
No, why would I not like
mainframe? No. The S word.

968
01:27:30,709 --> 01:27:34,757
- Sorry. The prisoners with jobs have armed themselves.
- Okay. That's better.

969
01:27:42,854 --> 01:27:45,891
Listen. We should talk.

970
01:27:45,892 --> 01:27:49,949
I disagree. Open communication
is never our family's forte.

971
01:27:49,949 --> 01:27:53,999
You have no idea. Been quite the
revelation since we last spoke.

972
01:27:53,999 --> 01:27:56,022
Hello.

973
01:27:56,022 --> 01:27:58,047
Hi.

974
01:28:04,121 --> 01:28:06,145
The Odin boys together.

975
01:28:06,145 --> 01:28:10,194
It's almost poetic that his
death have split us apart.

976
01:28:16,265 --> 01:28:18,289
We might as well
be strangers now.

977
01:28:18,290 --> 01:28:22,338
Two sons of the
crown, set adrift.

978
01:28:22,339 --> 01:28:24,364
Do not move!

979
01:28:24,364 --> 01:28:26,388
Thought you didn't
wanna talk about it.

980
01:28:27,402 --> 01:28:28,414
Here's the thing...

981
01:28:28,414 --> 01:28:33,474
- I'm probably better off staying here on Sakaar.
- That's exactly what I was thinking.

982
01:28:34,486 --> 01:28:37,522
- Did you just agree with me?
- This place is perfect for you.

983
01:28:37,522 --> 01:28:41,571
It's savage, chaotic, lawless.
You'll do great here.

984
01:28:41,571 --> 01:28:44,609
Do you truly think
so little of me?

985
01:28:44,617 --> 01:28:50,682
Loki, I thought the world of you. I thought
we were gonna fight side by side forever, but...

986
01:28:50,683 --> 01:28:53,727
At the end of the day,
you're you and I'm me.

987
01:28:53,727 --> 01:29:00,812
Maybe there's still good in you, but let's be
honest. Our paths diverged a long time ago.

988
01:29:03,851 --> 01:29:08,911
We have. It's probably for the best if
we never see each other again.

989
01:29:08,911 --> 01:29:11,948
That's what you've
always wanted.

990
01:29:14,983 --> 01:29:17,007
Hey, let's do ''get help.''

991
01:29:17,007 --> 01:29:18,021
- What?
- ''Get help.''

992
01:29:18,021 --> 01:29:19,033
- No.
- Come on, you'll love it.

993
01:29:19,034 --> 01:29:21,058
- I hate it. It's humiliating.
- It's great. Works every time.

994
01:29:22,068 --> 01:29:23,081
- Do you have a better plan?
- No.

995
01:29:23,081 --> 01:29:27,130
- We're doing it.
- We are not doing ''get help.''

996
01:29:27,131 --> 01:29:30,166
Get help, please!
My brother is dying!

997
01:29:30,166 --> 01:29:33,202
Get help! Help him.

998
01:29:34,215 --> 01:29:39,278
- Classic. Not for me, it's not.
- Still hate it. Humiliating.

999
01:29:39,278 --> 01:29:43,326
- Now which one's the ship you told us to get?
- The commodore.

1000
01:29:47,374 --> 01:29:51,423
Though I feel it wouldn't
make much of a difference.

1001
01:29:52,435 --> 01:29:54,461
Loki...

1002
01:29:54,461 --> 01:29:57,506
I know I betrayed you many times before,
but this time it's truly nothing personal.

1003
01:29:58,509 --> 01:30:00,543
The reward for your capture
will set me up nicely.

1004
01:30:01,546 --> 01:30:04,591
- Never one for sentiment, were you?
- Easier to let it burn.

1005
01:30:04,591 --> 01:30:06,617
I agree.

1006
01:30:13,701 --> 01:30:16,737
Oh, it looks painful.

1007
01:30:16,738 --> 01:30:19,774
Dear Brother, you're
becoming predictable.

1008
01:30:19,774 --> 01:30:23,823
I trust you, you betray me, round
and round in circles we go.

1009
01:30:23,823 --> 01:30:30,909
See, life is about growth, about change.
But you seem to just wanna stay the same.

1010
01:30:30,909 --> 01:30:35,970
I guess what I'm trying to say is that
you'll always be the God of Mischief...

1011
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:39,005
But you could be more.

1012
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:42,043
I'll just put this
over here for you.

1013
01:30:42,044 --> 01:30:47,103
Anyway, I've got places
to be, so good luck.

1014
01:30:51,153 --> 01:30:55,210
I can figure this out.
It's just another spaceship.

1015
01:31:07,358 --> 01:31:11,405
Loyal Sakaarians. Lord of
Thunder has stolen my ship,

1016
01:31:11,406 --> 01:31:16,467
and my favorite champion?
Sakaarians, take the skies!

1017
01:31:16,467 --> 01:31:20,516
Bring him down. Do not let
him leave this planet.

1018
01:31:32,663 --> 01:31:35,699
- Good shot.
- Thanks.

1019
01:31:36,712 --> 01:31:39,748
- Opening doors.
- Okay.

1020
01:31:44,808 --> 01:31:47,846
- I hope you're tougher than you look!
- Why?

1021
01:31:59,993 --> 01:32:04,041
- Shouldn't we shoot it back or something?
- Yes, we should.

1022
01:32:04,041 --> 01:32:05,061
Where are the
guns on this ship?

1023
01:32:05,062 --> 01:32:12,139
There aren't any. It's a () vessel.

1024
01:32:12,139 --> 01:32:14,172
Did she just
say orgies?

1025
01:32:14,172 --> 01:32:17,210
Don't touch anything.

1026
01:32:37,452 --> 01:32:39,477
No!

1027
01:32:41,502 --> 01:32:43,526
- No!
- No!

1028
01:32:49,601 --> 01:32:53,649
- Get inside!
- In a minute!

1029
01:33:03,770 --> 01:33:05,795
I should probably go to help.
Here, take the wheel!

1030
01:33:05,795 --> 01:33:08,840
- No, I can't fly one of these!
- You're a scientist. Use one of your PhDs.

1031
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:13,893
None of them are for
fying alien spaceships!

1032
01:33:48,316 --> 01:33:52,364
There's gotta be a gun on this
thing. That looks like a gun.

1033
01:34:05,524 --> 01:34:07,548
Yeah!

1034
01:34:23,745 --> 01:34:25,779
Guys, we're coming up
on the Devil's Anus.

1035
01:34:31,853 --> 01:34:35,900
There she is. Our
ticket out of here.

1036
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:38,937
Hey, what's this?

1037
01:34:41,974 --> 01:34:46,022
- Thank you.
- Hey man. We're about to jump on this ginormous spaceship.

1038
01:34:46,022 --> 01:34:50,070
- Do you want to come?
- Well, you do seem like...

1039
01:34:50,071 --> 01:34:54,119
- You're in desperate need of leadership.
- Why, thank you.

1040
01:34:57,156 --> 01:35:00,192
Here we go!

1041
01:35:05,253 --> 01:35:07,278
Shit!

1042
01:35:23,474 --> 01:35:28,535
Asgardians! Some
misguided soul,

1043
01:35:28,535 --> 01:35:32,593
has stolen the Bifrost
sword. Tell us where it is,

1044
01:35:32,593 --> 01:35:36,641
or there will be
consequences.

1045
01:35:39,677 --> 01:35:41,703
Bad ones.

1046
01:35:43,728 --> 01:35:46,765
So?

1047
01:35:51,826 --> 01:35:54,862
You.

1048
01:36:00,934 --> 01:36:02,959
Please!

1049
01:36:29,285 --> 01:36:35,351
Well? Executioner?

1050
01:36:38,395 --> 01:36:41,433
Wait...!

1051
01:36:42,445 --> 01:36:45,481
I know where the sword is.

1052
01:37:26,982 --> 01:37:30,018
I never thought
I'd be back here.

1053
01:37:33,056 --> 01:37:34,076
I thought it'd
be a lot nicer.

1054
01:37:35,079 --> 01:37:38,116
Not that it's not nice.
It's, it's on fire.

1055
01:37:38,116 --> 01:37:40,150
Here, up on the mountains.
Heat signatures.

1056
01:37:40,150 --> 01:37:42,175
People clustered together.
She's coming for them.

1057
01:37:43,178 --> 01:37:45,207
Drop me off at the palace.
I'll lure her away.

1058
01:37:45,207 --> 01:37:47,230
- And get yourself killed?
- The people trapped there are all that matters.

1059
01:37:47,230 --> 01:37:51,270
While I'm dealing with Hela, I need
you two to help get them off Asgard.

1060
01:37:51,271 --> 01:37:55,316
- How are we supposed to do that?
- I have a man on the ground.

1061
01:38:01,376 --> 01:38:03,399
Asgard...

1062
01:38:05,419 --> 01:38:07,443
She's here.

1063
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:22,600
- Now, ship has a gun.
- I'll take it from here.

1064
01:38:22,601 --> 01:38:25,634
I found this
in the armory.

1065
01:38:28,666 --> 01:38:30,687
Good luck.

1066
01:38:31,696 --> 01:38:33,719
Your Majesty.

1067
01:38:34,729 --> 01:38:36,751
Don't die.

1068
01:38:38,771 --> 01:38:40,802
You know what I mean.

1069
01:39:39,419 --> 01:39:41,440
Keep moving!

1070
01:39:41,441 --> 01:39:44,473
Go to the Bifrost.

1071
01:40:24,909 --> 01:40:26,930
Sister.

1072
01:40:28,951 --> 01:40:30,971
You are still alive.

1073
01:40:30,971 --> 01:40:32,992
I love what you've
done to the place.

1074
01:40:32,993 --> 01:40:34,005
Redecorating, I see.

1075
01:40:34,006 --> 01:40:39,175
It seems our father's solution to
every problem was to cover it up.

1076
01:40:39,279 --> 01:40:41,301
Or to cast it out.

1077
01:40:42,345 --> 01:40:46,396
He told you you were worthy,
he said the same thing to me.

1078
01:40:47,092 --> 01:40:51,135
You see? You
never knew him.

1079
01:40:51,473 --> 01:40:52,493
Not at his best.

1080
01:40:54,498 --> 01:40:58,550
Odin and I drowned entire
civilizations in blood and tears.

1081
01:40:58,806 --> 01:41:01,838
Where do you think
all this gunk came from?

1082
01:41:01,966 --> 01:41:06,483
And then, one day he decided
to become a benevolent king.

1083
01:41:06,650 --> 01:41:08,673
Fostered peace
to protect life.

1084
01:41:09,824 --> 01:41:11,845
To have you.

1085
01:41:12,056 --> 01:41:18,118
I understand why you're angry, and as my sister
you technically have a claim to the throne...

1086
01:41:18,495 --> 01:41:21,527
Believe me, I want someone
else to rule. But it can't be you.

1087
01:41:22,956 --> 01:41:23,968
You're just...

1088
01:41:24,818 --> 01:41:26,840
Worst.

1089
01:41:27,609 --> 01:41:29,630
Okay. Get up.

1090
01:41:29,935 --> 01:41:31,956
You are on my seat.

1091
01:41:32,381 --> 01:41:37,434
Our father once told me, "a
wise king never seeks out war..."

1092
01:41:37,547 --> 01:41:40,580
"But must always
be ready for it."

1093
01:42:11,175 --> 01:42:13,194
Go back!

1094
01:42:18,537 --> 01:42:20,558
Go!

1095
01:42:54,576 --> 01:42:57,606
To be honest,
I expected more.

1096
01:43:00,165 --> 01:43:03,197
Heimdall.

1097
01:43:03,461 --> 01:43:05,484
The sword!

1098
01:43:09,741 --> 01:43:13,784
Here's the difference between us. I'm
Odin's firstborn. The rightful heir.

1099
01:43:13,962 --> 01:43:18,003
The savior of Asgard.
And you are nothing.

1100
01:43:28,127 --> 01:43:31,161
So simple. Even a
blind man can see it!

1101
01:43:34,433 --> 01:43:38,473
Now you remind me of dad.

1102
01:43:46,838 --> 01:43:49,870
This stupid dog won't die!

1103
01:44:10,695 --> 01:44:12,717
Everything's gonna be alright, Val.
I got this.

1104
01:44:13,374 --> 01:44:15,404
You wanted to know who I am?

1105
01:44:16,358 --> 01:44:18,380
What the hell are you talking about?

1106
01:44:18,476 --> 01:44:20,497
You will see.

1107
01:45:08,625 --> 01:45:10,654
You see? No one's
going anywhere.

1108
01:45:10,812 --> 01:45:13,972
I'll get that sword, even if I have to
kill every single one of them to do it.

1109
01:45:41,446 --> 01:45:43,468
Hey, man.

1110
01:45:43,815 --> 01:45:47,304
I'm Korg, this is Miek. We're gonna jump
on that spaceship and get out of here.

1111
01:45:47,392 --> 01:45:48,906
Want to come?

1112
01:45:57,970 --> 01:46:03,023
Your savior is here!

1113
01:46:09,008 --> 01:46:13,051
Did you miss me? Every one.
Board that ship now.

1114
01:46:16,763 --> 01:46:19,936
- Welcome home. Saw you coming.
- Of course you did.

1115
01:46:36,884 --> 01:46:39,915
It will get another chance.

1116
01:46:39,915 --> 01:46:45,976
You see, I'm not a
queen or a monster.

1117
01:46:46,989 --> 01:46:50,019
I'm the goddess of death.

1118
01:46:50,019 --> 01:46:53,053
What were you the god of again?

1119
01:47:03,161 --> 01:47:06,190
Even when you had two eyes.

1120
01:47:06,191 --> 01:47:09,222
You see only half the picture.

1121
01:47:09,223 --> 01:47:13,265
She is too strong. Without
my hammer, I can't.

1122
01:47:13,267 --> 01:47:17,307
Are you Thor, the
god of hammers?

1123
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:24,390
That hammer was to help you
control your power. Focus it.

1124
01:47:24,391 --> 01:47:26,413
It was never your
source of strength.

1125
01:47:27,415 --> 01:47:29,444
It's too late, she has
already taken Asgard.

1126
01:47:30,447 --> 01:47:33,486
Asgard is not a place.
Never was.

1127
01:47:34,497 --> 01:47:36,519
This could be Asgard.

1128
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:38,542
Asgard is where
our people stand.

1129
01:47:39,888 --> 01:47:44,943
Even now, right now. Those
people need your help.

1130
01:47:51,681 --> 01:47:54,712
But I'm not as strong as you.

1131
01:47:56,734 --> 01:48:00,777
No. You're stronger.

1132
01:48:09,871 --> 01:48:14,923
Tell me, brother. What
were you the god of again?

1133
01:50:29,301 --> 01:50:31,322
- You okay?
- You're missing an eye.

1134
01:50:31,379 --> 01:50:33,400
Is there anything else?

1135
01:50:39,664 --> 01:50:44,709
- I think we should disband the Revengers.
- Hit her with a lightning blast.

1136
01:50:44,750 --> 01:50:48,793
I just hit her with the biggest lightning blast
in the history of lightning. It did nothing.

1137
01:50:50,937 --> 01:50:53,969
We just need to hold her off
until everyone's on board.

1138
01:50:54,057 --> 01:51:00,119
It won't end there. The longer Hela's
on Asgard, the more powerful she grows.

1139
01:51:00,289 --> 01:51:02,310
She'll hunt us down.

1140
01:51:02,421 --> 01:51:05,453
- We need to stop her here and now.
- So what do we do?

1141
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:07,774
I'm not doing "get help."

1142
01:51:19,339 --> 01:51:23,381
Asgard is not a place.
It's a people.

1143
01:51:23,605 --> 01:51:30,678
Loki, this was never about stopping
Ragnarok. This was about causing it.

1144
01:51:30,713 --> 01:51:33,743
Surtur's crown, in the vault.

1145
01:51:33,768 --> 01:51:35,790
It's the only way.

1146
01:51:35,968 --> 01:51:40,009
Bold move, brother.
Even for you.

1147
01:51:43,144 --> 01:51:46,626
- Shall we?
- After you.

1148
01:52:11,084 --> 01:52:13,105
This is madness.

1149
01:52:26,156 --> 01:52:29,630
Go! Go now!

1150
01:53:28,583 --> 01:53:30,606
For Asgard!

1151
01:54:09,717 --> 01:54:14,769
With the Eternal
Flame, you are reborn.

1152
01:54:25,423 --> 01:54:28,454
Hela! Enough!

1153
01:54:30,276 --> 01:54:37,348
- You want Asgard? It's yours!
- Whatever game you're playing, it won't work.

1154
01:54:37,477 --> 01:54:39,498
You can't defeat me.

1155
01:54:39,523 --> 01:54:41,545
Oh, I know.

1156
01:54:42,731 --> 01:54:44,752
But he can.

1157
01:54:57,217 --> 01:55:04,292
Asgard! I am your reckoning!

1158
01:55:11,615 --> 01:55:15,658
The people are safe.
That's all that matters.

1159
01:55:18,081 --> 01:55:21,377
- We're fulfilling the prophecy.
- I hate this prophecy.

1160
01:55:21,523 --> 01:55:30,619
So do I but we have no choice. Surtur destroys Asgard,
he destroys Hela so that our people may live.

1161
01:55:32,391 --> 01:55:34,412
No!

1162
01:55:35,697 --> 01:55:39,011
Hulk, stop, you moron!

1163
01:55:46,629 --> 01:55:52,690
Hulk, stop! Just for once
in your life, don't smash.

1164
01:55:52,739 --> 01:55:54,759
Big monster!

1165
01:55:54,985 --> 01:55:58,426
- Let's go!
- Fine!

1166
01:56:22,724 --> 01:56:26,765
I am your doom!

1167
01:56:48,013 --> 01:56:54,077
The damage looks bad, but as long as the foundations
are still strong, we can rebuild this place.

1168
01:56:54,232 --> 01:57:00,294
It will become a haven for all
peoples and aliens of the universe.

1169
01:57:05,589 --> 01:57:09,630
No. Those foundations are gone.
Sorry.

1170
01:57:23,227 --> 01:57:26,259
Asgard's gone.

1171
01:57:26,378 --> 01:57:28,784
You saved us from extinction.

1172
01:57:28,841 --> 01:57:31,874
Asgard is not a place.

1173
01:57:32,243 --> 01:57:34,357
It's a people.

1174
01:58:03,203 --> 01:58:05,224
That suits you.

1175
01:58:07,247 --> 01:58:10,277
You know, maybe you're not
so bad after all, brother.

1176
01:58:10,279 --> 01:58:12,299
Maybe not.

1177
01:58:12,301 --> 01:58:14,320
Thank you.

1178
01:58:14,322 --> 01:58:17,354
If you're here, I might
even give you a home.

1179
01:58:20,723 --> 01:58:22,744
I'm here.

1180
01:58:45,406 --> 01:58:47,868
Your throne.

1181
01:59:02,270 --> 01:59:06,314
Thor. King of Asgard.

1182
01:59:15,274 --> 01:59:19,316
- Where to?
- I'm not sure.

1183
01:59:19,812 --> 01:59:22,539
Any suggestions?

1184
01:59:23,512 --> 01:59:27,547
- Miek, where are you from?
- Oh, Miek's dead.

1185
01:59:27,875 --> 01:59:34,942
Yeah, I accidentally stomped on him on the bridge. I
felt so guilty, I've been carrying him around all day.

1186
01:59:36,169 --> 01:59:40,341
Oh, Miek, you're alive! He's alive, guys.
What was the question again, bruv?

1187
01:59:40,858 --> 01:59:43,888
Earth, it is.
