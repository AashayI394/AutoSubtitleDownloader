The.Dark.Knight,"00:01:45,089","00:01:47,924","Three of a kind, let's do this. that's it? three guys?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:01:48,092","00:01:51,426",Two guys on the roof. every guy gets a share. five shares is plenty.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:01:51,596","00:01:54,051",Six shares. don't forget the guy who planned the job.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:01:54,223","00:01:56,512",He thinks he can sit it out and still take a slice.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:01:56,684","00:01:59,804",- I know why they call him the Joker. why do they call him the Joker?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:01:59,979","00:02:01,806",I heard he wears makeup. makeup?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:02:01,981","00:02:03,938","Yeah, to scare people. you know, war paint."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:02:16,496","00:02:19,699","All right, everybody, hands up, heads down!"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:02:20,083","00:02:22,870","I said, hands up, heads down!"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:02:23,044","00:02:25,998","Let's go, pal, I'm making a withdrawal here."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:02:26,255","00:02:27,714","- I said, hands up! - no!"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:02:28,091","00:02:30,332",Here comes the silent alarm.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:02:30,510","00:02:31,838",And there it goes.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:02:32,011","00:02:33,209",Heads down!
The.Dark.Knight,"00:02:33,388","00:02:35,713","All right, tootsie, you're taking a dive with me."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:02:35,890","00:02:38,559","- down! I said, stay down there! don't hurt me!"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:02:38,810","00:02:41,811","Funny, it didn't dial 911. it was trying to reach a private number."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:02:41,979","00:02:43,889","Is it a problem? no, I'm done here."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:02:53,282","00:02:55,655",Sit down! down!
The.Dark.Knight,"00:02:56,160","00:02:58,319","Down! I said, stay down there!"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:03:02,583","00:03:05,419",Obviously we don't want you doing anything with your hands...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:03:05,586","00:03:08,504",...other than holding on for dear life.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:03:16,264","00:03:18,256",On the ground! stay on the ground!
The.Dark.Knight,"00:03:18,433","00:03:22,098",Nobody make a move! nobody! stay down!
The.Dark.Knight,"00:03:42,415","00:03:44,491",You have any idea who you're stealing from?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:03:44,667","00:03:48,368","- you and your friends are dead. he's out, right?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:03:51,466","00:03:52,711",What...?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:04:00,558","00:04:02,301",Where did you learn to count?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:04:05,104","00:04:07,144",They wired this thing up with like 5000 volts.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:04:07,315","00:04:08,560",What kind of bank does that?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:04:08,733","00:04:11,769",A mob bank. I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:04:11,944","00:04:12,976",Where's the alarm guy?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:04:13,154","00:04:15,645","Boss told me when the guy was done, I should take him out."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:04:15,823","00:04:17,152","One less share, right?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:04:18,076","00:04:20,317","Funny, he told me something similar."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:04:20,495","00:04:21,953",He what? no! no!
The.Dark.Knight,"00:04:33,675","00:04:35,050",That's a lot of money.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:04:35,218","00:04:38,918","If this Joker guy was so smart, he'd have had us bring a bigger car."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:04:40,348","00:04:44,262",I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me soon as we loaded the cash.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:04:45,186","00:04:48,970","No, no, no, I kill the bus driver."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:04:49,691","00:04:50,805",Bus driver?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:04:53,027","00:04:54,521",What bus driver?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:04:58,616","00:05:00,525",School's out. time to go.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:05:00,702","00:05:02,943","That guy's not getting up, is he?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:05:03,705","00:05:05,365",That's a lot of money.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:05:08,876","00:05:11,202",What happened to the rest of the guys?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:05:17,969","00:05:20,341","You think you're smart, huh?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:05:21,055","00:05:22,680",The guy that hired youse...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:05:23,224","00:05:25,797",...he'll just do the Same to you.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:05:26,102","00:05:29,056","Oh, criminals in this town used to believe in things."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:05:29,230","00:05:30,511",Honor...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:05:30,690","00:05:32,398",...respect.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:05:32,567","00:05:34,892","Look at you. what do you believe in, huh?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:05:35,069","00:05:36,350",What do you believe in?!
The.Dark.Knight,"00:05:36,696","00:05:41,607",I believe whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:05:43,202","00:05:44,745",...stanger.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:06:26,704","00:06:29,622","Mr. mayor, you were elected in a campaign to clean up the city."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:06:29,791","00:06:31,949",- when are you gonna start? I already have.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:06:32,126","00:06:33,205",Like this batman.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:06:33,378","00:06:35,951","We're hearing he's doing good, criminals are running scared."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:06:36,130","00:06:39,831","- no, man. I don't like it tonight. - what are you, superstitious?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:06:40,009","00:06:43,094",You got more chance of winning the powerball than running into him.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:06:43,262","00:06:46,631",That's not true. our men in the major crimes unit are close to an arrest.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:06:46,808","00:06:49,762","Hey, Wuertz, mayor says you're closing in on the batman."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:06:49,936","00:06:52,059",The investigation is ongoing.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:06:52,230","00:06:54,637",The process of cleaning up the streets is a long one.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:06:54,816","00:06:56,808","I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:07:01,155","00:07:03,444","Ever intending to see your wife again, lieutenant?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:07:03,616","00:07:06,285","I thought you had to go look after your mother, detective."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:07:06,452","00:07:08,409",Checked her back into the hospital.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:07:08,871","00:07:10,496",I'm sorry.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:07:10,998","00:07:14,284",- so he hasn't shown up? - he often doesn't.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:07:14,669","00:07:16,377",I like reminding everybody he's out there.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:07:16,546","00:07:17,826",Why wouldn't he come?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:07:18,172","00:07:19,999",Hopefully...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:07:20,508","00:07:22,050",...because he's busy.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:07:38,776","00:07:41,694",That's why we bring dogs.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:07:41,863","00:07:44,188",- my little princes. please.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:07:44,365","00:07:47,948","Please, they're crawling in my mouth. please, I beg you, get them off."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:07:48,119","00:07:50,871",Look what your drugs do to my customers.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:07:51,039","00:07:52,663",Buyer beware.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:07:52,832","00:07:56,035",I told you my compound would take you places.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:07:56,210","00:07:58,962",I never said they'd be places you wanted to go.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:07:59,130","00:08:01,668","My business, repeat customers."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:08:01,841","00:08:03,549",You don't like what I have to offer...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:08:03,718","00:08:05,461",...you can buy from someone else.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:08:05,636","00:08:08,388",Assuming batman left anyone to buy from.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:08:11,726","00:08:15,724",My dogs are hungry.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:08:19,359","00:08:21,731",Pity there's only one of you.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:08:29,702","00:08:31,362",What...? that's not him.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:08:35,750","00:08:37,493",Loose the dogs!
The.Dark.Knight,"00:08:50,223","00:08:51,765",That's more like it.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:10:19,854","00:10:21,597",Don't let me find you out here again.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:10:21,773","00:10:24,608",- we're trying to help you. I don't need help.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:10:24,776","00:10:26,104",Not my diagnosis.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:10:26,277","00:10:29,860",What gives you the right? what's the difference between you and me?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:10:30,031","00:10:32,901",I'm not wearing hockey pads.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:10:36,412","00:10:38,369",Everybody back now!
The.Dark.Knight,"00:10:40,541","00:10:43,708",He can't resist showing us his face.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:10:47,965","00:10:50,124",What's he hiding under that makeup?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:10:57,850","00:11:00,520","Uh, can we get a minute, people, please?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:11:03,147","00:11:05,306",Him again. who are the others?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:11:05,483","00:11:07,061",Another bunch of smalltimers.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:11:08,444","00:11:10,152",Some of the marked bills I gave you.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:11:10,321","00:11:12,610",My detectives have been making drug buys with them.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:11:12,782","00:11:15,355",This bank was another drop for the mob. that makes five.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:11:15,535","00:11:18,108",- we found the bulk of their dirty cash. - time to move in.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:11:18,287","00:11:22,071","We'd have to hit all banks simultaneously. swat teams, backup."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:11:22,417","00:11:24,077",What about this Joker guy?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:11:24,252","00:11:27,206",One man or the entire mob? he can wait.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:11:27,380","00:11:29,705","When the new da hears about this, he'll want in."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:11:29,882","00:11:32,420",- do you trust him? - be hard to keep him out.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:11:32,593","00:11:36,045",I hear he's as stubborn as you are.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:12:19,599","00:12:22,553",Be nice when Wayne manor's rebuilt.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:12:22,727","00:12:25,432",You can swap not sleeping in a penthouse...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:12:25,605","00:12:27,147",...for not sleeping in a mansion.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:12:27,315","00:12:31,063","Whenever you stitch yourself up, you do make a bloody mess."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:12:31,235","00:12:34,236",Yeah. it makes me learn from my mistakes.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:12:34,405","00:12:37,821","You ought to be pretty knowledgeable by now, then."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:12:39,535","00:12:40,567",My armor.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:12:40,745","00:12:44,328",I'm carrying too much weight. I need to be... I need to be faster.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:12:44,499","00:12:47,168",I'm sure mr. Fox can oblige.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:12:47,335","00:12:49,826",- did you get mauled by a tiger? - it was a dog.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:12:50,004","00:12:52,542",- huh? - it was a big dog.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:12:52,715","00:12:56,583","There were more copycats last night, Alfred, with guns."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:12:56,761","00:12:58,670","Why not hire them, take the weekend off?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:12:58,846","00:13:01,681",That wasn't exactly what I had in mind...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:13:01,849","00:13:03,593",...when I said I wanted to inspire people.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:13:03,768","00:13:05,677",I know.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:13:05,853","00:13:07,348",But things have improved.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:13:07,563","00:13:10,019",Look at the new district attorney.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:13:10,692","00:13:12,684","I am, closely."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:13:12,860","00:13:14,770",Need to know if he can be trusted.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:13:14,946","00:13:18,990",Are you interested in his character or his social circle?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:13:22,829","00:13:25,201",Who Rachel spends her time with is her business.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:13:26,999","00:13:29,241",I trust you don't have me followed on my day off.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:13:29,419","00:13:31,495","If you ever took one, I might."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:13:33,339","00:13:35,213","Know your limits, master Wayne."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:13:35,383","00:13:38,503",Batman has no limits.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:13:38,678","00:13:41,714","- well, you do, sir. - well, can't afford to know them."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:13:41,889","00:13:44,380",And what's gonna happen on the day that you find out?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:13:44,559","00:13:47,264","We all know how much you like to say ""i told you so."""
The.Dark.Knight,"00:13:47,437","00:13:50,770","On that day, master Wayne, even I won't want to."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:13:50,940","00:13:52,399",Probably.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:13:59,240","00:14:00,900","Sorry I'm late, folks."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:14:04,829","00:14:07,035",- where were you? - worried you'd have to step up?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:14:07,206","00:14:10,207","- Harvey, I know these briefs backwards. - well, then..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:14:10,376","00:14:12,369",...fair's fair.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:14:12,545","00:14:14,585","Heads, I'll take it. tails, he's all yours."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:14:14,756","00:14:16,832",Yeah? you wanna flip a coin to see who leads?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:14:17,008","00:14:20,424","My father's lucky coin. as I recall, it got me my first date with you."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:14:20,595","00:14:23,761",I wouldn't leave something like that up to chance.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:14:24,098","00:14:27,183",I don't. I make my own luck.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:14:28,686","00:14:32,731",All rise. the honorable judge freel presiding.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:14:32,899","00:14:35,568",I thought the da just played golf with the mayor.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:14:35,735","00:14:39,435","Teeoff's 1:30. more than enough time to put you away for life, sally."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:14:39,614","00:14:41,156",With Carmine Falcone in Arkham...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:14:41,324","00:14:44,325",...someone must have stepped up to run the so-called family.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:14:45,203","00:14:47,445",Is that man in this courtroom today?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:14:48,998","00:14:52,616","- could you identify him for us, please? - you win, counselor."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:14:54,962","00:14:56,457",It was me.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:14:58,174","00:15:01,958",I have a sworn statement from you that this man...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:15:02,136","00:15:05,837","...Salvatore Maroni, is the new head of the Falcone crime family."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:15:06,015","00:15:10,143",Maroni? he's a fall guy. I'm the brains of the organization.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:15:11,521","00:15:13,063",Order. - permission to treat...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:15:13,231","00:15:14,476",...the witness as hostile? - granted.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:15:14,649","00:15:15,680",- hostile? I'll show you hostile!
The.Dark.Knight,"00:15:21,906","00:15:24,658","Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in china."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:15:24,826","00:15:26,368","If you wanna kill a public servant, mr. Maroni..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:15:26,536","00:15:28,742",...i recommend you buy american.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:15:29,664","00:15:32,285","Get him out of here. - but, your honor, I'm not done."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:15:36,004","00:15:39,289","We'll never be able to link the gun to Maroni, so we can't charge him."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:15:39,465","00:15:42,252","But they're trying to kill you, means we're getting to them."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:15:42,427","00:15:45,546","I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel. I'm fine, by the way."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:15:45,722","00:15:47,430","Come on, Harvey. you're Gotham's da."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:15:47,598","00:15:50,434","You're not getting shot at, you're not doing your job right."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:15:50,601","00:15:51,800","But, you know..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:15:51,978","00:15:55,311","...if you said you were rattled, we could take the rest of the day off."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:15:55,481","00:15:58,399",Can't. I dragged the head of the major crimes unit down here.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:15:58,568","00:16:03,313","Oh, Jim Gordon? he's a friend, actually. try to be nice."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:16:12,373","00:16:15,160",I hear you got a hell of a right cross.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:16:18,463","00:16:20,586",It's a shame sal's going to walk.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:16:20,757","00:16:22,672","Yeah, well, good thing about the mob"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:16:22,673","00:16:24,801",Is they keep giving you second chances
The.Dark.Knight,"00:16:29,974","00:16:32,299",Lightly irradiated bills.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:16:32,769","00:16:35,057",Fancy stuff for a city cop. have help?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:16:35,521","00:16:37,229",We liaise with various agencies...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:16:37,398","00:16:39,142","Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:16:39,317","00:16:42,900",Official policy is to arrest the vigilante known as batman on sight.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:16:43,071","00:16:45,229",Mm-hm. what about that floodlight on the top of mcu?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:16:45,406","00:16:47,814",If you got problems with malfunctioning equipment...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:16:47,992","00:16:51,195","...i suggest you take them up with maintenance, counselor."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:16:51,496","00:16:54,034",I've put every money Launderer in Gotham behind bars...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:16:54,207","00:16:56,579",...but the mob is still getting its money out.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:16:56,751","00:17:00,202",I think you and your friend have found the last game in town.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:17:00,380","00:17:03,084","You're trying to hit them where it hurts, their wallets."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:17:03,257","00:17:04,420",It's bold.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:17:05,468","00:17:06,499",You gonna count me in?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:17:07,053","00:17:10,422","In this town, the fewer people know something, the safer the operation."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:17:10,598","00:17:12,840",I don't like that you got your own special unit...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:17:13,017","00:17:15,935",...and it's full of cops I investigated at internal affairs.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:17:16,104","00:17:18,939",If I didn't work with cops you'd investigated while at ia...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:17:19,107","00:17:20,352",...i'd be working alone.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:17:21,109","00:17:23,018",I don't get political points for being an idealist.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:17:23,194","00:17:25,602",I do the best I can with what I have.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:17:29,200","00:17:32,949",You want me to back warrants for search and seizure on five banks...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:17:33,121","00:17:34,947",...without telling me what we're after.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:17:36,040","00:17:38,614",I can give you the names of the banks.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:17:38,793","00:17:40,702","Well, that's a start."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:17:41,087","00:17:43,412","I'll get you your warrants, but I want your trust."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:17:43,589","00:17:45,249","Oh, you don't have to sell me, Dent."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:17:45,425","00:17:47,417",We all know you're Gotham's White knight.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:17:48,678","00:17:52,129","Yeah, well, I heard they have a different name for me down at mcu."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:17:52,724","00:17:54,004",I wouldn't know about that.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:17:55,184","00:17:58,968","In china, Lau security investments stands for dynamic new growth."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:17:59,147","00:18:03,441",A joint chinese venture with Wayne enterprises will be a powerhouse.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:18:03,609","00:18:05,519","Well, mr. Lau..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:18:05,903","00:18:08,655",...i speak for the rest of the board...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:18:09,240","00:18:12,158","...and mr. Wayne, in expressing our own excitement."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:18:17,040","00:18:18,543","Sir, I know mr. Wayne is curious"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:18:18,544","00:18:20,658",About how his trust fund gets replenished..
The.Dark.Knight,"00:18:20,835","00:18:23,326","...but, frankly, this is embarrassing."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:18:23,504","00:18:26,078","You worry about the diligence, mr. Reese."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:18:26,257","00:18:28,546",I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:18:28,718","00:18:30,260",It's done.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:18:30,428","00:18:32,171",The numbers are solid.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:18:32,347","00:18:33,889",Do them again.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:18:34,057","00:18:37,141","Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out, now, would we?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:18:39,854","00:18:41,479",Another long night?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:18:41,647","00:18:44,601","This joint venture was your idea, and the consultants love it."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:18:45,276","00:18:46,521",But I'm not convinced.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:18:46,694","00:18:50,359",Lau's company has grown by 8 percent annually like clockwork.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:18:50,531","00:18:52,939",His revenue stream must be off the books...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:18:53,117","00:18:54,528",...maybe even illegal.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:18:54,702","00:18:56,362",Okay. cancel the deal.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:18:57,705","00:18:58,868",You already knew.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:18:59,582","00:19:02,120",Just needed a closer look at their books.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:19:02,293","00:19:04,333",Anything else you can trouble me for?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:19:04,796","00:19:06,338",I need a new suit.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:19:06,506","00:19:08,997","Yeah. three buttons is a little '90s, mr. Wayne."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:19:09,175","00:19:12,295","I'm not talking fashion, mr. Fox, so much as function."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:19:13,346","00:19:15,054",You wanna be able to turn your head.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:19:15,223","00:19:17,299",Sure make backing out of the driveway easier.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:19:17,767","00:19:19,309",I'll see what I can do.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:19:24,065","00:19:26,022",Took three weeks to get a reservation here.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:19:26,192","00:19:28,315",I had to tell them I work for the government.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:19:28,486","00:19:29,731",- really? - health inspector's...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:19:29,904","00:19:31,149",...not afraid to pull strings.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:19:31,322","00:19:33,529",Rachel. fancy that.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:19:33,700","00:19:36,191","Yeah, Bruce. fancy that."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:19:36,536","00:19:38,694","Rachel, natascha. natascha, Rachel."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:19:38,871","00:19:44,245",- natascha. are you the prima...? - prima ballerina for the moscow ballet.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:19:44,419","00:19:47,752",- wow. Harvey's taking me next week. - really? so you're into ballet?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:19:48,089","00:19:50,247",Bruce. this is Harvey Dent.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:19:50,591","00:19:54,340",The famous Bruce Wayne. Rachel's told me everything about you.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:19:54,512","00:19:55,710",I certainly hope not.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:19:56,055","00:19:59,389",- let's put a couple tables together. - I'm not sure that they'll let us.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:19:59,559","00:20:02,595","Oh, they should. I own the place."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:03,062","00:20:06,016",How could you want to raise children in a city like this?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:06,190","00:20:08,148","Well, I was raised here. I turned out okay."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:08,317","00:20:09,895",Is Wayne manor in the city limits?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:11,738","00:20:13,280",The palisades? sure.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:13,448","00:20:15,903","You know, as our new da, you might wanna figure out..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:16,075","00:20:17,902",...where your jurisdiction ends.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:18,077","00:20:22,027",I'm talking about the kind of city that idolizes a masked vigilante.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:22,206","00:20:25,575",Gotham city is proud of an ordinary citizen standing up for what's right.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:25,752","00:20:27,993","Gotham needs heroes like you, elected officials..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:28,171","00:20:30,128",...not a man who thinks he's above the law.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:30,298","00:20:31,460",Who appointed the batman?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:31,632","00:20:35,464",We did. all of us who stood by and let scum take control of our city.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:35,636","00:20:37,380","But this is a democracy, Harvey."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:37,555","00:20:39,298",When their enemies were at the gates...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:39,474","00:20:41,229",...the romans would suspend democracy
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:41,230","00:20:43,174",And appoint one man to protect the city
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:43,353","00:20:45,926","It wasn't considered an honor, it was a public service."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:46,105","00:20:47,765","Harvey, the last man that they appointed..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:47,940","00:20:50,229",...to protect the republic was named caesar...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:50,401","00:20:53,817","...and he never gave up his power. - okay, fine."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:53,988","00:20:55,317",You either die a hero...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:55,490","00:20:58,526",...or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:20:58,701","00:21:02,201","Whoever the batman is, he doesn't wanna do this for the rest of his life."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:21:02,372","00:21:05,622",How could he? batman is looking for someone to take up his mantle.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:21:05,792","00:21:08,080","Someone like you, mr. Dent?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:21:08,544","00:21:11,000",Maybe. if I'm up to it.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:21:11,172","00:21:16,415",What if Harvey Dent is the caped crusader? hm?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:21:18,680","00:21:21,846","If I were sneaking out every night, someone would've noticed by now."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:21:24,227","00:21:28,355","Well, I'm sold, Dent, and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:21:28,523","00:21:31,358","That's nice, but I'm not up for reelection for three years."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:21:31,526","00:21:33,435","No, you don't understand."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:21:33,611","00:21:36,398",One fundraiser with my pals...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:21:37,031","00:21:39,154",...you'll never need another cent.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:21:53,881","00:21:56,004",What the hell is this?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:21:57,343","00:22:00,463","As you're all aware, one of our deposits was stolen."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:00,638","00:22:04,007","A relatively small amount, 68 million."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:04,183","00:22:06,721",Who's stupid enough to steal from us?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:07,061","00:22:10,596","Two-bit wackjob, wears a cheap purple suit and makeup."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:10,773","00:22:12,730",He's not the problem. he's a nobody.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:12,900","00:22:16,269",The problem is our money being tracked by the cops.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:16,446","00:22:18,937",Thanks to mr. Maroni's well-placed sources...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:19,115","00:22:20,812",... we know that police have indeed
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:20,814","00:22:22,899",Identified our banks using marked bills..
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:23,077","00:22:25,568",... and are planning to seize your funds today.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:25,747","00:22:27,645",And since the enthusiastic new d a has
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:27,646","00:22:29,744",Put all my competitors out of business..
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:30,376","00:22:33,876","...i'm your only option. so, what are you proposing?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:34,047","00:22:37,712","Moving all deposits to one secure location, not a bank."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:37,884","00:22:39,841","- where, then? - no one can know but me."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:40,595","00:22:43,346",If the police were to gain leverage over one of you...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:43,514","00:22:45,306",... everyone's money would be at stake.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:45,475","00:22:47,598",What stop them getting to you?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:47,769","00:22:50,853","I go to hong kong, far from Dent's jurisdiction..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:51,230","00:22:54,101",... and the chinese will not extradite one of their own.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:54,275","00:22:55,900",How soon can you move the money?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:56,194","00:22:57,273",I already have.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:22:59,655","00:23:02,277","For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait for your permission."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:23:02,909","00:23:06,574","Rest assured, your money is safe."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:23:18,925","00:23:21,167",And I thought my jokes were bad.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:23:21,344","00:23:24,428",Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my boy pull your head off.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:23:24,597","00:23:25,878",How about a magic trick?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:23:29,227","00:23:31,552",I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:23:33,856","00:23:34,971",Ta-da!
The.Dark.Knight,"00:23:35,149","00:23:36,644",It's...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:23:36,818","00:23:39,106",It's gone.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:23:39,487","00:23:41,812","Oh, and by the way, the suit, it wasn't cheap."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:23:41,989","00:23:44,825","- you ought to know, you bought it. sit."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:23:45,910","00:23:48,946",I want to hear proposition.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:23:51,666","00:23:54,157",Let's wind the clocks back a year.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:23:54,502","00:24:00,172",These cops and lawyers wouldn't dare cross any of you.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:24:01,342","00:24:03,465","I mean, what happened?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:24:03,636","00:24:07,420",Did your balls drop off? hm?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:24:07,598","00:24:09,638","You see, a guy like me..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:24:10,101","00:24:12,853",- a freak. damn right.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:24:13,021","00:24:16,140","A guy like me... look, listen."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:24:16,691","00:24:20,985","I know why you choose to have your little, ahem..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:24:21,154","00:24:23,858",...group-therapy sessions in broad daylight.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:24:24,365","00:24:27,152",I know why you're afraid to go out at night.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:24:29,370","00:24:31,030",The batman.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:24:31,205","00:24:36,448","See, batman has shown Gotham your true colors, unfortunately."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:24:36,627","00:24:40,127","Dent, he's just the beginning."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:24:40,715","00:24:45,460",And as for the television's so-called plan...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:24:45,928","00:24:47,802",...batman has no jurisdiction.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:24:47,972","00:24:50,546",He'll find him and make him squeal.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:24:50,725","00:24:53,726",I know the squealers when I see them...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:24:56,314","00:24:57,808",What do you propose?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:24:57,982","00:25:00,390","It's simple. we, uh, kill the batman."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:25:01,736","00:25:04,690","If it's so simple, why haven't you done it already?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:25:04,864","00:25:07,569","If you're good at something, never do it for free."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:25:08,242","00:25:09,523",How much you want?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:25:10,244","00:25:12,237","Uh, half."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:25:14,457","00:25:17,209","You're crazy. - no, I'm not."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:25:17,377","00:25:19,499","No, I'm not."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:25:21,089","00:25:24,505",If we don't deal with this now...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:25:24,676","00:25:26,300",...soon...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:25:26,511","00:25:31,422",...little Gambol here won't be able to get a nickel for his grandma.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:25:32,100","00:25:33,558",Enough from the clown!
The.Dark.Knight,"00:25:33,726","00:25:36,680","Ah, ta-ta-ta. let's not blow..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:25:36,854","00:25:39,392",Shit! ...this out of proportion.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:25:39,565","00:25:42,056",You think you can steal from us and just walk away?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:25:42,235","00:25:43,777",- yeah. I'm putting the word out.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:25:43,945","00:25:46,234",Five hundred grand for this clown dead.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:25:46,406","00:25:49,442","A million alive, so I can teach him some manners first."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:25:50,743","00:25:53,317","All right. so, listen, why don't you give me a call..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:25:53,496","00:25:57,245",...when you wanna start taking things a little more seriously?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:25:57,417","00:25:59,290",Here's my card.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:26:19,397","00:26:21,769",You're a hard man to reach.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:26:24,777","00:26:27,066",Lau's halfway to hong kong.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:26:28,364","00:26:31,199","If you'd have asked, I could have taken his passport."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:26:31,367","00:26:34,037",All that was left in the vaults were marked bills.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:26:34,203","00:26:37,489",They knew we were coming. as soon as your office got involved...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:26:37,665","00:26:38,696",My office?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:26:38,875","00:26:40,459",You're sitting down there with scum
The.Dark.Knight,"00:26:40,460","00:26:42,540",Like Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking..
The.Dark.Knight,"00:26:42,712","00:26:45,832","Oh, yeah. I almost had your rookie cold on a racketeering beat."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:26:46,007","00:26:48,251",Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
The.Dark.Knight,"00:26:48,252","00:26:50,550","Maroni's got people in your office, Dent"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:26:53,348","00:26:55,305",We need Lau back...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:26:55,475","00:26:59,424",...but the chinese won't extradite a national under any circumstances.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:26:59,771","00:27:02,475","If I get him to you, can you get him to talk?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:27:02,648","00:27:03,847",I'll get him to sing.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:27:04,025","00:27:06,777",We're going after the mob's life savings.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:27:06,944","00:27:08,189",Things will get ugly.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:27:08,363","00:27:10,651","I knew the risk when I took this job, lieutenant."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:27:10,823","00:27:12,365","How will you get him back, any...?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:27:14,952","00:27:16,363",He does that.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:27:16,537","00:27:20,037",Our chinese friends left town before I could tell them the deal was off.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:27:20,208","00:27:23,707","Well, I'm sure that you've always wanted to go to hong kong."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:27:23,878","00:27:26,036",What's wrong with a phone call?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:27:26,214","00:27:29,832",I think mr. Lau deserves a more personal touch.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:27:31,052","00:27:32,879","Now, for high-altitude jumps..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:27:33,054","00:27:35,841",...you're going to need oxygen and stabilizers.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:27:36,015","00:27:39,633","Well, I must say, compared to your usual requests..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:27:39,811","00:27:42,384",...jumping out of an airplane is pretty straightforward.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:27:43,022","00:27:45,145",What about getting back into the plane?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:27:45,316","00:27:49,148",- I'd recommend a good travel agent. - without it landing.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:27:50,321","00:27:53,073","Now, that's more like it, mr. Wayne."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:27:53,616","00:27:56,237",The cia had a program back in the '60s...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:27:56,411","00:27:59,744",...for getting their people out of hot spots called sky hook.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:27:59,914","00:28:02,583",- we could look into that. - yeah.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:28:02,750","00:28:04,410",Okay. now...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:28:05,920","00:28:08,625",Hardened kevlar plates over titanium-dipped...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:28:08,798","00:28:10,921",...tri-weave fibers for flexibility.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:28:11,092","00:28:13,927","You'll be lighter, faster, more agile."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:28:17,432","00:28:19,590",Perhaps you should read the instructions first?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:28:19,767","00:28:21,760","- yeah. - now, there is a tradeoff."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:28:21,936","00:28:25,435",Separation of the plates makes you more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:28:25,606","00:28:28,560","We wouldn't wanna make things too easy, now, would we?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:28:28,735","00:28:30,774",How will it hold up against dogs?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:28:30,945","00:28:33,068",We talking rottweilers or chihuahuas?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:28:34,282","00:28:36,773",Should do fine against cats.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:28:36,951","00:28:39,074",I found one in arizona.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:28:39,245","00:28:42,163",A very nice man said he could have it up and running in a week...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:28:42,331","00:28:43,411",...and he takes cash.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:28:43,583","00:28:46,418",- what about the flight crew? - south korean smugglers.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:28:46,586","00:28:48,792","They run flights into pyongyang, below radar."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:28:48,963","00:28:51,715","- did you think of an alibi? - oh, yes."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:29:10,485","00:29:13,106","I believe this is your plane, sir."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:29:17,325","00:29:20,824","You look tired, Alfred. you'll be all right without me?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:29:22,497","00:29:25,996","If you can tell me the russian for ""apply your own bloody suntan lotion."""
The.Dark.Knight,"00:29:37,136","00:29:40,968","Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you. they say they've just killed the Joker."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:29:41,140","00:29:42,967",They brought the body.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:29:59,367","00:30:01,858","So, dead, that's 500."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:30:03,830","00:30:05,621",How about alive? hm?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:30:08,835","00:30:12,001",You wanna know how I got these scars?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:30:13,923","00:30:16,924",My father was...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:30:17,093","00:30:18,552",...a drinker...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:30:18,720","00:30:19,965",...and a fiend.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:30:20,805","00:30:24,969","And one night, he goes off crazier than usual."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:30:25,393","00:30:28,180",Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:30:28,354","00:30:29,896",He doesn't like that...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:30:30,064","00:30:33,516",...not one bit.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:30:33,693","00:30:36,231","So, me watching..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:30:36,404","00:30:40,982","...he takes the knife to her, Laughing while he does it."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:30:44,412","00:30:48,077","He turns to me and said ""why so serious?"""
The.Dark.Knight,"00:30:48,332","00:30:49,910",He comes at me with the knife.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:30:50,585","00:30:52,494","""why so serious?"""
The.Dark.Knight,"00:30:54,756","00:30:57,626",He sticks the blade in my mouth.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:30:57,967","00:31:01,881","""let's put a smile on that face."""
The.Dark.Knight,"00:31:03,097","00:31:05,304",And...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:31:07,685","00:31:09,227",Why so serious?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:31:14,275","00:31:15,769",Now...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:31:15,943","00:31:18,185",...our operation is small...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:31:18,363","00:31:21,280",...but there is a lot of potential...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:31:21,449","00:31:23,987",...for aggressive expansion.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:31:24,160","00:31:27,363",So which of you fine gentlemen would like to join our team?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:31:27,538","00:31:31,951","Oh. there's only one spot open right now, so we're gonna have..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:31:32,627","00:31:34,785",...tryouts.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:31:39,384","00:31:41,376",Make it fast.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:31:50,812","00:31:52,222","Welcome to hong kong, mr. Fox."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:31:52,397","00:31:55,101",Mr. Lau regrets he is unable to greet you in person today.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:31:55,274","00:31:57,184",I understand.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:32:06,994","00:32:10,577","For security purposes, I'm gonna have to ask you to check in your mobile."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:32:10,748","00:32:12,326",Of course.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:32:15,086","00:32:18,786",I must apologize for leaving Gotham in the middle of our negotiations.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:32:18,965","00:32:22,500",This misunderstanding with the Gotham police force...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:32:22,677","00:32:25,215",...i couldn't let it threaten my company. - of course.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:32:25,388","00:32:28,555",A businessman of your stature will understand and...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:32:28,725","00:32:32,674","...with you here now, we can continue."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:32:32,854","00:32:34,545","Well, I do appreciate you bringing me"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:32:34,546","00:32:36,602","Out here in such style, mr. Lau, but I re.."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:32:38,151","00:32:39,977",We do not allow cell phones in here.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:32:40,153","00:32:42,857",I'm sorry. forgot I had it.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:32:43,031","00:32:45,127","No, I really came to tell you that"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:32:45,128","00:32:47,657",Our business deal has to be put on hold
The.Dark.Knight,"00:32:48,202","00:32:51,287","You see, we can't afford to be seen to do business with..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:32:52,415","00:32:54,372",...whatever it is you're accused of being.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:32:54,542","00:32:57,115",I'm sure a businessman of your stature will understand.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:32:57,295","00:33:01,209","I think, mr. Fox, a simple phone call might have sufficed."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:33:01,382","00:33:04,751",Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think he was deliberately wasting your time.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:33:04,927","00:33:06,552",Just accidentally wasting it.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:33:07,555","00:33:11,719","That's very good, mr. Lau. ""accidentally."" very good."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:33:12,518","00:33:13,847","Hey, sir."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:33:32,080","00:33:34,072",There's a better view from the peak tram.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:33:34,248","00:33:36,075",How's the view from lsi holdings?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:33:36,376","00:33:37,918",Restricted.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:33:38,086","00:33:40,078",Lau is holed up in there good and tight.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:33:40,254","00:33:42,164",- what's this? - I had r & d work it up.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:33:42,340","00:33:44,000",Sends out a high-frequency pulse...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:33:44,175","00:33:47,010",...records the response time for mapping an environment.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:33:47,512","00:33:50,085",Sonar. just like a...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:33:50,264","00:33:52,423","Submarine, mr. Wayne. like a submarine."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:33:52,934","00:33:54,761",- and the other device? - it's in place.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:33:55,687","00:33:56,718",Mr. Wayne?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:33:57,939","00:33:59,219",Good luck.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:37:49,212","00:37:52,378","Look, give us the money and we'll talk about making a deal."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:37:52,548","00:37:55,834",The money is the only reason I'm still alive.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:37:56,010","00:37:57,943","Oh, you mean, when they find out that"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:37:57,944","00:38:00,138","You've helped us, they're gonna kill you"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:38:00,306","00:38:02,014",- are you threatening my client? - no.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:38:02,183","00:38:06,395",I'm just assuming your client's cooperation with this investigation.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:38:08,022","00:38:09,682",As will everyone.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:38:11,025","00:38:14,359",No? okay.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:38:14,821","00:38:17,822","Enjoy your time in county, mr. Lau."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:38:17,990","00:38:19,485",Wait!
The.Dark.Knight,"00:38:19,701","00:38:21,693",I won't give you the money...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:38:21,869","00:38:24,870","...but I will give you my clients, all of them."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:38:25,164","00:38:27,371",You were a glorified accountant.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:38:27,542","00:38:31,374",What could you possibly have on all of them that we could charge?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:38:31,546","00:38:35,378",I'm good with calculation. I handled all their investments.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:38:35,550","00:38:37,127",One big pot.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:38:38,511","00:38:39,839",Got it.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:38:40,263","00:38:42,090",One minute.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:38:42,890","00:38:45,595",Rico. if they pooled their money...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:38:45,768","00:38:47,560",...we can charge them as one criminal conspiracy.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:38:47,729","00:38:48,891",Charge them with what?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:38:49,063","00:38:51,934","In a Rico case, if you can charge one of them with a felony..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:38:52,108","00:38:54,681",You can charge all of them with it. that's great.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:38:56,070","00:38:57,979",Mr. Lau.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:38:58,990","00:39:02,988",What kind of details do you have about this communal fund?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:39:03,161","00:39:04,785","- ledgers...? - immunity, protection..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:39:04,954","00:39:08,405",...a chartered plane back to hong kong. - after you testify in open court.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:39:08,583","00:39:10,908",I'm just curious. with all your clients locked up...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:39:11,252","00:39:13,458",...what's gonna happen with all that money?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:39:13,629","00:39:16,749","Like I said, I'm good with calculation."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:39:16,924","00:39:21,586",He can't go to county. I'll keep him here in the holding cells.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:39:21,763","00:39:24,301","What is this, Gordon, your fortress?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:39:24,599","00:39:27,268","Well, you trust them over at county?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:39:27,435","00:39:29,262",I don't trust them here.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:39:31,022","00:39:32,516",Lau stays.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:39:32,982","00:39:35,556","Well, I don 't know about mr. Lau's travel arrangements..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:39:35,735","00:39:37,526",... but I'm sure glad he's back.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:39:37,695","00:39:40,151",Put word out. we hire the clown.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:39:42,950","00:39:46,782",He was right. we have to fix real problem.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:39:47,288","00:39:48,403",Batman.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:39:52,960","00:39:56,875",- I'm not aware of any participation... - our boy looks good on the tube.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:39:57,382","00:40:00,133",You sure you wanna embarrass me in front of my friends?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:40:00,301","00:40:03,966","Oh, don't worry. they're coming too."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:40:10,812","00:40:12,638",Have a nice trip. see you next fall.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:40:12,814","00:40:14,640",Seven hundred twelve counts of extortion.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:40:14,816","00:40:17,223",Eight hundred and forty-nine counts of racketeering.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:40:17,402","00:40:19,940",Two hundred and forty-six counts of fraud.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:40:20,113","00:40:22,948",Eighty-seven counts of conspiracy murder.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:40:23,866","00:40:26,986",Five hundred and twenty-seven counts of obstruction of justice.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:40:27,412","00:40:28,787",How do the defendants plead?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:40:35,962","00:40:36,993",Order in the court.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:40:37,171","00:40:39,662",Five hundred and forty-nine criminals at once.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:40:39,841","00:40:42,332",How did you convince Surrillo to hear this farce?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:40:42,510","00:40:46,638","She shares my enthusiasm for justice. after all, she is a judge."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:40:46,806","00:40:49,842",Even if you blow enough smoke to get convictions out of Surrillo...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:40:50,018","00:40:52,591",...you're gonna set a new record at appeals.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:40:52,770","00:40:55,261","It won't matter. the head guys make bail, sure."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:40:55,440","00:40:57,847","But the midlevel guys, they can't."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:40:58,026","00:40:59,852",They can't afford to be off the streets.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:41:00,028","00:41:02,150",They'll cut deals that include some jail time.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:41:02,321","00:41:05,322",Think of all you could do with 18 months of clean streets.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:41:06,868","00:41:09,987","Mr. mayor, you can't... - no, get out. both of you."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:41:14,167","00:41:15,709",Sit down.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:41:20,673","00:41:23,674",The public likes you. that's the only reason that this might fly.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:41:23,843","00:41:25,171",But that means it's on you.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:41:25,345","00:41:28,381","They're all gonna come after you now, and not just the mob."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:41:28,556","00:41:32,388","Politicians, journalists, cops."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:41:32,560","00:41:35,051",Anyone whose wallet's about to get lighter.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:41:35,229","00:41:37,899",Are you up to it? you'd better be.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:41:38,066","00:41:40,189",Because they get anything on you...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:41:40,360","00:41:42,665",...and those criminals are back on the
The.Dark.Knight,"00:41:42,666","00:41:45,152","Streets, followed swiftly by you and me"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:41:45,323","00:41:46,603",Jesus!
The.Dark.Knight,"00:42:07,762","00:42:10,218","I think your fundraiser will be a great success, sir."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:42:10,390","00:42:13,059",And why do you think I wanna hold a party for Harvey Dent?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:42:13,226","00:42:16,310",I assumed it was your usual reason for socializing beyond myself...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:42:18,690","00:42:20,481",To try to impress miss Dawes.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:42:20,650","00:42:24,730","Very droll, but very wrong. actually, it's Dent."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:42:24,904","00:42:27,775",Police released video footage found concealed on the body.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:42:27,949","00:42:30,570","Sensitive viewers, be aware. the image is disturbing."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:42:30,743","00:42:32,950",Tell them your name.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:42:33,121","00:42:34,781",Brian Douglas.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:42:36,374","00:42:38,699",And are you the real batman?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:42:38,876","00:42:39,908",No. no?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:42:40,086","00:42:42,043",- no. - no?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:42:42,213","00:42:43,921",Then why do you dress up like him?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:42:46,676","00:42:50,756",Because he's a symbol that we don 't have to be afraid of scum like you.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:42:50,930","00:42:54,264","Yeah. you do, Brian. you really do."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:42:54,434","00:42:58,052","Huh? yeah. oh, shh, shh, shh."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:42:58,229","00:43:02,690",So you think batman 's made Gotham a better place? hm?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:43:02,900","00:43:04,443",Look at me.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:43:04,610","00:43:06,899",Look at me!
The.Dark.Knight,"00:43:10,658","00:43:14,157","You see, this is how crazy batman 's made Gotham."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:43:14,328","00:43:16,617",You want order in Gotham...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:43:16,956","00:43:21,369",... batman must take off his mask and turn himself in.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:43:21,544","00:43:25,328","Oh, and every day he doesn 't, people will die."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:43:25,673","00:43:27,796",Starting tonight.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:43:28,217","00:43:30,424",I'm a man of my word.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:43:47,695","00:43:50,530","Harvey Dent, scourge of the underworld..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:43:50,698","00:43:53,783",...scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:43:53,951","00:43:55,196",- I'll be back. - Rachel.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:43:55,370","00:43:58,205","A little liquid courage, mr. Dent?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:43:58,373","00:44:00,780","- thank you. Alfred, right? - that's right, sir."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:44:00,958","00:44:04,244",Rachel talks about you all the time. you've known her her whole life.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:44:04,420","00:44:05,665","Not yet, sir."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:44:07,965","00:44:10,207",Any psychotic ex-boyfriends I should be aware of?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:44:10,385","00:44:12,626","Oh, you have no idea."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:44:31,572","00:44:32,983",I'm sorry that I'm late.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:44:33,157","00:44:35,529",I'm glad to see that you all got started without me.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:44:35,702","00:44:39,402","Now, where is Harvey? where...?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:44:39,580","00:44:41,988","Harvey Dent, the man of the hour."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:44:42,166","00:44:43,495",Where's Rachel Dawes?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:44:43,668","00:44:46,040",She is my oldest friend. come here.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:44:46,212","00:44:48,703",When Rachel first told me she was dating Harvey Dent...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:44:48,881","00:44:50,079",...I had one thing to say
The.Dark.Knight,"00:44:50,299","00:44:52,707","""the guy from those god-awful campaign commercials?"""
The.Dark.Knight,"00:44:52,885","00:44:56,717","""i believe in Harvey Dent."" yeah, nice slogan, Harvey."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:44:56,889","00:44:58,882",But it caught Rachel's attention.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:44:59,058","00:45:02,059",And then I started to pay attention to Harvey...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:45:02,478","00:45:05,764",...and all that he's been doing as our new da.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:45:05,940","00:45:07,731",And you know what?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:45:09,777","00:45:11,271",I believe in Harvey Dent.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:45:11,446","00:45:15,028","I believe that on his watch, Gotham can feel..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:45:15,199","00:45:18,864","...a little safer, a little more optimistic."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:45:20,288","00:45:24,617",Look at this face. this is the face of Gotham's bright future.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:45:24,792","00:45:26,951",To Harvey Dent. let's hear it for him.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:45:27,337","00:45:28,879",Harvey.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:45:38,389","00:45:39,848",Harvey may not know you well enough...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:45:40,016","00:45:41,973",...to understand you're making fun of him...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:45:42,143","00:45:44,136","...but I do. - no, I meant every word."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:45:45,480","00:45:48,397",You know that day that you once told me about...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:45:48,566","00:45:50,642",...when Gotham would no longer need batman?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:45:50,818","00:45:52,728",- it's coming. - Bruce.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:45:53,571","00:45:56,117",- you can't ask me to wait for that.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:45:56,118","00:45:59,158",- it's happening now. Harvey is that hero
The.Dark.Knight,"00:45:59,327","00:46:01,056",He locked up half of the city's
The.Dark.Knight,"00:46:01,057","00:46:03,788","Criminals, and he did it without wearing a mask"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:46:03,956","00:46:06,163",Gotham needs a hero with a face.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:46:07,001","00:46:09,290","You can throw a party, Wayne, I'll give you that."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:46:10,672","00:46:12,581",Thanks again.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:46:13,383","00:46:15,091",You mind if I borrow Rachel?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:46:18,554","00:46:20,927","Lieutenant, that Joker card pinned to the body?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:46:21,099","00:46:22,842",Forensics found three sets of dna.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:46:23,017","00:46:24,428",- any matches? - all three.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:46:24,602","00:46:28,101","The dna belongs to judge Surrillo, Harvey Dent and commissioner loeb."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:46:28,272","00:46:30,265",The Joker's telling us who he's targeting.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:46:30,441","00:46:33,312",Get a unit over to Surrillo's house. tell Wuertz to find Dent.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:46:33,486","00:46:35,526",Protective custody. where's the commissioner?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:46:35,697","00:46:37,191",- city hall. - seal the building.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:46:37,365","00:46:39,357",- no one in or out till I get there. - got it.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:46:51,671","00:46:54,043",Gordon. what are you up to?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:46:54,215","00:46:57,465",We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor search of the entire building.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:46:57,635","00:47:00,209",We believe the Joker's made a threat against your life.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:47:00,388","00:47:01,799",These are dangerous people.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:47:01,973","00:47:03,716",You're not giving me a lot of information.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:47:03,891","00:47:05,849",Even we don't know where you're going.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:47:06,019","00:47:09,352","Take the envelope, get in, open it. it'll tell you where you're headed."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:47:13,192","00:47:15,102",You can't leave me alone with these people.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:47:15,278","00:47:18,314",The whole mob's after you and you're worried about these guys?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:47:18,489","00:47:20,446","Compared to this, the mob doesn't scare me."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:47:20,616","00:47:24,199","Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this for yourself, so..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:47:24,370","00:47:28,450","...take my word, the police commissioner earns a lot of threats."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:47:28,624","00:47:34,164",I found the appropriate response to these situations a long time ago.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:47:34,380","00:47:36,622",Them gunning for you makes you see things clearly.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:47:36,799","00:47:38,128","Yeah, I bet."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:47:38,301","00:47:42,595",Yeah. it makes you think about things you couldn't stand losing...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:47:42,764","00:47:44,756",...about who you wanna spend your life with.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:47:44,932","00:47:47,933",- that's a pretty big commitment. - not if the mob has their way.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:47:53,149","00:47:55,854",You get to explain to my wife...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:47:56,778","00:47:58,355",...why I'm late for dinner.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:47:58,529","00:48:01,696","Sir, the Joker card had traces of your dna on it."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:48:03,284","00:48:05,905",- don't do that. - all right.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:48:06,454","00:48:09,371","- let's be serious, then. - okay."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:48:09,707","00:48:10,738",What's your answer?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:48:16,923","00:48:18,417",I don't have an answer.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:48:20,593","00:48:21,624",How'd they get my dna?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:48:21,803","00:48:23,961",Somebody with access to your office or house...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:48:24,138","00:48:26,760",...must have lifted a tissue or a glass... wait! wait!
The.Dark.Knight,"00:48:26,933","00:48:29,850","- well, I guess no answer is a no. - Harvey."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:48:30,019","00:48:32,142","- it's someone else, isn't it? - Harvey."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:48:32,313","00:48:35,480",Just tell me it's not Wayne. the guy's a complete f...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:48:35,983","00:48:37,442",What are you doing?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:48:48,621","00:48:49,652","Oh, shit."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:48:55,837","00:48:57,580",Get a medic!
The.Dark.Knight,"00:49:01,009","00:49:02,123",They've come for him.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:49:03,636","00:49:04,799",We made it.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:49:07,390","00:49:08,421",Stay hidden.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:49:10,685","00:49:14,018","Good evening, ladies and gentlemen."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:49:16,941","00:49:20,855",We are tonight's entertainment.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:49:21,696","00:49:24,021",I only have one question:
The.Dark.Knight,"00:49:24,240","00:49:27,775",Where is Harvey Dent?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:49:37,253","00:49:39,329",You know where Harvey is? you know who he is?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:49:39,505","00:49:40,786","Hands up, pretty boy."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:49:47,930","00:49:50,718",Do you know where I can find Harvey? I need to talk to him.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:49:50,892","00:49:53,727","Just something little, huh? no."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:49:56,022","00:49:58,774",What's going on out there? Wayne!
The.Dark.Knight,"00:50:00,234","00:50:01,610","Oh, thank god, you've got a panic room."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:50:01,778","00:50:02,940","Hey, wait..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:50:03,529","00:50:05,321","Oh, you gotta be kidding me."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:50:05,615","00:50:07,607","You know, I'll settle for his loved ones."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:50:07,784","00:50:11,283",We're not intimidated by thugs.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:50:12,246","00:50:13,954",You know...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:50:15,583","00:50:18,584",...you remind me of my father.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:50:19,045","00:50:20,872",I hated my father.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:50:21,047","00:50:23,086","Okay, stop."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:50:26,928","00:50:29,763","Well, hello, beautiful."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:50:31,933","00:50:35,765",You must be Harvey's squeeze. hm?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:50:36,145","00:50:38,636",And you are beautiful.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:50:45,571","00:50:49,439",You look nervous. is it the scars?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:50:50,368","00:50:52,574",You wanna know how I got them?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:50:53,788","00:50:56,326",Come here. hey.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:50:56,708","00:50:58,415",Look at me.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:50:58,876","00:51:03,622","So I had a wife. she was beautiful, like you..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:51:03,881","00:51:08,093",...who tells me I worry too much...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:51:08,261","00:51:11,178",...who tells me I ought to smile more...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:51:11,347","00:51:16,852",...who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. hey.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:51:17,270","00:51:19,677",One day they carve her face.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:51:20,189","00:51:24,436",And we have no money for surgeries. she can't take it.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:51:24,819","00:51:28,318",I just wanna see her smile again. hm?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:51:28,656","00:51:31,574",I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:51:32,118","00:51:33,660",So...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:51:34,245","00:51:37,910",...i stick a razor in my mouth and do this...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:51:38,374","00:51:39,750",...to myself.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:51:40,043","00:51:45,119",And you know what? she can't stand the sight of me.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:51:45,298","00:51:46,840",She leaves.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:51:47,550","00:51:49,958",Now I see the funny side.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:51:50,845","00:51:52,423",Now I'm always smiling.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:51:55,850","00:51:59,184",You got a little fight in you. I like that.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:51:59,354","00:52:00,682",Then you're gonna love me.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:52:28,841","00:52:30,039",Drop the gun.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:52:30,218","00:52:32,839","Oh, sure. you just take off your little mask..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:52:33,012","00:52:35,219",...and show us all who you really are. hm?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:52:40,853","00:52:42,051",Let her go.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:52:42,855","00:52:44,266",Very poor choice of words.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:07,088","00:53:08,962",Are you all right?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:11,217","00:53:13,589",Let's not do that again.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:13,886","00:53:16,377",- is Harvey okay? - he's safe.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:17,932","00:53:19,261",Thank you.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:19,600","00:53:20,632","Jim, it's over."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:20,810","00:53:23,383","As long as they don't get to Lau, we've cut off their funds."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:23,563","00:53:25,057",The prosecution's over.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:25,231","00:53:26,891",Nobody's standing up in front of a judge...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:27,066","00:53:30,067",...while judges and police commissioners are getting blown away.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:30,236","00:53:32,027",- what about Dent? - he's got any sense...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:32,196","00:53:33,276",...Dent's halfway to mex...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:33,448","00:53:35,025",So where do you keep your trash?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:36,367","00:53:37,420",You're due in court.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:37,421","00:53:40,317",I need you alive long enough to get you on the record
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:40,496","00:53:43,533",You can't protect me. you can't even protect yourselves.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:43,708","00:53:47,041","You refuse to cooperate, you're not coming back here, you go to county."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:47,211","00:53:49,667",How long do you calculate you'll last in there?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:51,090","00:53:52,584",Targeting me won't get their money.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:52,759","00:53:54,585",I knew the mob wouldn't go down easily...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:54,761","00:53:56,837",...but this is different. they crossed a line.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:57,013","00:53:58,258",You crossed the line first.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:53:58,431","00:54:01,847","You squeezed them, you hammered them to the point of desperation."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:54:02,018","00:54:03,661","And in their desperation,"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:54:03,662","00:54:07,012",They turned to a man they didn't fully understand
The.Dark.Knight,"00:54:07,523","00:54:10,061","Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:54:10,234","00:54:12,441",We just need to figure out what he's after.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:54:12,612","00:54:14,023","With respect, master Wayne..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:54:14,197","00:54:17,151",...perhaps this is a man you don't fully understand either.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:54:17,950","00:54:20,655","A long time ago, I was in burma..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:54:20,828","00:54:24,244",...and my friends and I were working for the local government.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:54:24,415","00:54:26,989",They were trying to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:54:27,168","00:54:30,003",...by bribing them with precious stones...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:54:30,171","00:54:32,375",...but their caravans were being raided
The.Dark.Knight,"00:54:32,376","00:54:34,750",In a forest north of rangoon by a bandit
The.Dark.Knight,"00:54:34,926","00:54:38,211",So we went looking for the stones.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:54:38,596","00:54:43,721","But in six months, we never met anyone who traded with him."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:54:44,352","00:54:48,350","One day, I saw a child playing with a ruby..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:54:48,523","00:54:51,559",...the size of a tangerine.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:54:51,818","00:54:55,187",The bandit had been throwing them away.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:54:55,863","00:54:58,568",- so why steal them? - because he thought it was good sport.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:54:58,741","00:55:03,699","Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:55:03,871","00:55:08,118","They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:55:08,543","00:55:12,375",Some men just wanna watch the world burn.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:55:32,817","00:55:33,980","Your name, sir?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:55:34,152","00:55:37,318",Eighth and Orchard. you'll find Harvey Dent there.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:55:50,209","00:55:51,668",Check the names.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:55:58,259","00:55:59,967","""richard Dent."""
The.Dark.Knight,"00:56:02,180","00:56:03,259","""patrick Harvey."""
The.Dark.Knight,"00:56:03,556","00:56:04,587",Harvey Dent.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:56:04,766","00:56:07,767",I need 10 minutes with the scene before your men contaminate it.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:56:07,977","00:56:10,184",It's because of you these guys are dead...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:56:10,355","00:56:11,897",Detective!
The.Dark.Knight,"00:56:14,108","00:56:16,148","Give us a minute, guys."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:56:17,362","00:56:18,939",That's brick underneath.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:56:19,280","00:56:20,940",Gonna take ballistics off a shattered bullet?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:56:21,115","00:56:22,740",No.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:56:24,202","00:56:26,111",Fingerprints.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:56:34,671","00:56:36,580","Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:56:38,383","00:56:43,091",Because we found his next target. he's put it in tomorrow's paper.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:57:00,405","00:57:02,693","I'm not sure you made it loud enough, sir."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:57:15,795","00:57:17,918","What can I do for you, mr. Reese?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:57:18,089","00:57:21,873",You wanted me to do the diligence on the lsi holdings deal again.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:57:22,552","00:57:24,840","Well, I found some irregularities."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:57:25,263","00:57:27,339",Their ceo is in police custody.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:57:27,515","00:57:30,433","No, not with their numbers, with yours."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:57:30,643","00:57:33,727",Applied sciences. whole division of Wayne enterprises...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:57:33,896","00:57:35,556",...just disappeared overnight.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:57:35,732","00:57:39,979",I went down to the archives and I started pulling some old files.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:57:41,112","00:57:42,986",Don't tell me you didn't recognize your baby...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:57:43,156","00:57:46,774",...pancaking cop cars on the evening news.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:57:47,076","00:57:50,279",Now you got the entire r & d department burning through cash...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:57:50,455","00:57:53,788",...claiming it's related to cell phones for the army?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:57:53,958","00:57:57,042","What are you building for him now, a rocket ship?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:57:58,921","00:58:00,665",I want...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:58:00,840","00:58:04,754",...$ 10 million a year for the rest of my life.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:58:07,263","00:58:09,386",Let me get this straight.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:58:10,600","00:58:13,055",You think that your client...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:58:13,227","00:58:16,312","One of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world..."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:58:16,481","00:58:18,058",...is secretly a vigilante...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:58:18,232","00:58:20,222",...who spends his nights beating
The.Dark.Knight,"00:58:20,223","00:58:22,894",Criminals to a pulp with his bare hands..
The.Dark.Knight,"00:58:23,071","00:58:26,237",...and your plan is to blackmail this person?
The.Dark.Knight,"00:58:33,706","00:58:34,987",Good luck.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:58:37,877","00:58:39,288",When...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:58:40,713","00:58:42,172",Keep that.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:58:48,846","00:58:51,302",This is your original scan.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:58:52,725","00:58:55,014",Here it is reengineered.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:59:03,236","00:59:06,771",And there's the thumbprint he left when he pushed the round in the clip.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:59:08,783","00:59:09,946",I'll get you a copy.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:59:10,159","00:59:13,943","Mr. Wayne, did you reassign r & d?"
The.Dark.Knight,"00:59:14,122","00:59:16,613",Yeah. government telecommunications project.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:59:16,791","00:59:18,830",Wasn't aware we had any government contracts.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:59:19,085","00:59:22,086","You know, Lucius, I'm playing this one pretty close to the chest."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:59:23,214","00:59:24,922",Fair enough.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:59:27,844","00:59:29,302",With no word from the batman...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:59:29,470","00:59:30,965",...even as they mourn commissioner loeb...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:59:31,139","00:59:34,508",...these cops have to wonder if the Joker will make good on his threat...
The.Dark.Knight,"00:59:34,684","00:59:37,887",...in the obituary column of the Gotham times to kill the mayor.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:59:39,689","00:59:43,354",I've checked all the databases. there are four possibles.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:59:43,526","00:59:45,649",Cross-reference the addresses.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:59:45,820","00:59:49,818","Look for parkside, overlooking the parade."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:59:51,034","00:59:52,148",I got one.
The.Dark.Knight,"00:59:52,326","00:59:56,324","Melvin White, 1502 Randolph apartments."
The.Dark.Knight,"00:59:56,706","01:00:00,786","Aggravated assault, moved to Arkham twice."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:00:39,874","01:00:41,452",What do you got on the roof?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:00:41,626","01:00:45,161","We're tight, but frankly, there's a lot of windows up here."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:00:53,721","01:00:57,766",Commissioner loeb dedicated his life to law enforcement...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:00:57,934","01:01:00,223",...and to the protection of his community.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:01:00,395","01:01:02,186",I remember when I first took office...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:01:02,355","01:01:04,893",...and I asked if he wanted to stay on as commissioner.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:01:05,066","01:01:10,309","And he said he would, provided I kept my politics out of his office."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:01:14,075","01:01:17,242","Clearly he was not a man who minced words, nor should he have been."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:01:18,413","01:01:21,912",A number of policies that he enacted as commissioner were unpopular.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:01:22,083","01:01:25,333",Policies that flooded my office with angry calls and letters...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:01:29,716","01:01:31,376",- who's that? - what happened?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:01:32,427","01:01:34,300",They took our guns.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:01:34,470","01:01:36,262",And our uniforms.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:01:42,854","01:01:45,605",And as we recognize the sacrifice of this man...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:01:45,773","01:01:49,723",...we must remember that vigilance is the price of safety.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:01:49,902","01:01:52,393",Stand by. honor guard.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:01:52,572","01:01:56,190",Attention. port arms.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:01:57,410","01:02:01,787",Ready! aim! fire!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:02:02,582","01:02:04,124",Ready! aim!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:02:07,754","01:02:10,126",Ready! aim!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:02:18,556","01:02:19,967",Stay down! don't move!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:02:21,809","01:02:23,469",Mr. mayor. get him out of here.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:02:32,695","01:02:34,937",- I'll see you later. - why are you going back?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:02:47,585","01:02:48,616",Get out of here.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:02:52,674","01:02:54,417",Tell me what you know about the Joker.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:03:25,456","01:03:26,785",No.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:03:27,208","01:03:28,536","I'm sorry, Barbara."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:03:29,460","01:03:32,710","Jimmy, go play with your sister. go ahead, honey."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:03:32,880","01:03:35,122","If there's anything we can do, anything you need..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:03:35,299","01:03:37,043",...we're here for you.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:03:40,722","01:03:41,967",Are you out there?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:03:43,307","01:03:47,804",Are you? you brought this craziness on us. you did!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:03:47,979","01:03:50,351",You brought this on us!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:03:51,399","01:03:55,977","Switch it off, he ain't coming. he doesn't wanna talk to us."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:03:56,404","01:03:59,405",God help whoever he does wanna talk to.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:04:01,075","01:04:03,993",Can't we go someplace quieter? we can't hear each other talk.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:04:04,162","01:04:06,997",What makes you think I wanna hear you talk?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:04:07,165","01:04:08,196",What?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:04:37,612","01:04:39,236",- yeah? second.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:04:39,405","01:04:40,436",Okay.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:04:40,615","01:04:42,773","- Harvey, where are you? where are you?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:04:42,950","01:04:45,073","I'm where you should be, at major crimes."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:04:45,244","01:04:46,787",I'm trying to deal with all of this mess.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:04:46,954","01:04:48,654",- can I get the fingerprint analysis?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:04:48,655","01:04:50,537","- Rachel, listen to me. you're not safe there"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:04:50,708","01:04:52,500",- this is Gordon's unit. - Gordon 's gone.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:04:52,669","01:04:56,251",He vouched for these men. - and he's gone.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:05:00,885","01:05:02,961",The Joker's named you next.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:05:03,137","01:05:06,138","God, is there someone, is there anyone in this town we can trust?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:05:06,307","01:05:08,015",Bruce.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:05:08,309","01:05:09,472",We can trust Bruce Wayne.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:05:09,644","01:05:11,221","No. Rachel, I know you're his friend, but..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:05:11,396","01:05:13,222","Harvey, trust me."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:05:13,398","01:05:16,149",Bruce's penthouse is now the safest place in the city.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:05:16,317","01:05:17,646",Then you go straight there.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:05:17,819","01:05:19,942",Don 't tell anybody and I'll find you there.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:05:20,113","01:05:21,821",I love you.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:05:35,837","01:05:37,082",I want the Joker.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:05:38,297","01:05:39,957",From one professional to another...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:05:40,133","01:05:42,671","...you're trying to scare somebody, pick a better spot."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:05:42,844","01:05:45,417","From this height, the fall wouldn't kill me."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:05:45,596","01:05:47,174",- I'm counting on it. - huh!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:05:54,564","01:05:57,684",- where is he? - I don't know where he is. he found us.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:05:57,859","01:05:59,139",He must have friends.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:05:59,485","01:06:01,774",Friends? have you met this guy?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:06:01,946","01:06:03,524",Someone knows where he is.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:06:03,698","01:06:06,189",Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:06:06,367","01:06:07,696",They're wise to your act.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:06:07,869","01:06:11,866","You got rules. the Joker, he's got no rules."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:06:12,040","01:06:16,915","Nobody's gonna cross him for you. if you want this guy, you got one way."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:06:17,086","01:06:18,878",But you already know what that is.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:06:19,047","01:06:21,834","Just take off that mask, let him come find you."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:06:23,468","01:06:25,372",Or you can let a couple more people
The.Dark.Knight,"01:06:25,373","01:06:27,548",Get killed while you make up your mind
The.Dark.Knight,"01:06:29,223","01:06:31,216",You wanna play games?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:06:37,523","01:06:38,555",How's that feel?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:06:38,733","01:06:41,354",- you wouldn't. - I wouldn't!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:06:42,862","01:06:44,487",- you don't think I will? - mm-mm.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:06:44,655","01:06:46,695",- you don't think I will? - mm-mm.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:06:48,076","01:06:51,279","No. no, I wouldn't."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:06:52,497","01:06:55,035",That's why I'm not gonna leave it up to me.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:06:56,042","01:06:59,043","Heads, you get to keep your head."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:06:59,462","01:07:01,087",Tails...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:07:02,048","01:07:03,079",...not so lucky.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:07:03,466","01:07:07,001",So you wanna tell me about the Joker?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:07:16,396","01:07:20,096","- let's go again. - I don't know anything! god, don't!"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:07:20,274","01:07:22,647","You're not playing the odds, friend."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:07:23,778","01:07:25,771",Let's do it again.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:07:28,616","01:07:30,443",You'd leave a man's life to chance?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:07:31,202","01:07:34,785","- not exactly. - his name's Schiff, Thomas."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:07:34,956","01:07:37,957","He's a paranoid schizophrenic, former patient at Arkham."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:07:38,126","01:07:42,752",The kind of mind the Joker attracts. what do you expect to learn from him?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:07:46,092","01:07:48,879",The Joker killed Gordon. he's gonna kill Rachel.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:07:49,053","01:07:51,840",You're the symbol of hope I could never be.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:07:52,015","01:07:53,841",Your stand against organized crime...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:07:54,017","01:07:57,220",...is the first legitimate ray of light in Gotham in decades.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:07:57,395","01:08:01,013","If anyone saw this, everything would be undone."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:08:01,190","01:08:03,479",The criminals you arrested would be released...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:08:03,651","01:08:06,735",...and Jim Gordon will have died for nothing.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:08:07,363","01:08:09,605",You're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:08:09,782","01:08:12,154",- why? - no one else will die because of me.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:08:12,326","01:08:14,652",Gotham's in your hands now.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:08:14,829","01:08:16,537",You can't.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:08:16,706","01:08:18,081",You can't give in.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:08:18,374","01:08:20,912",You can't give in!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:08:36,267","01:08:37,512",Harvey called.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:08:37,685","01:08:40,722",He said batman's gonna turn himself in.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:08:40,897","01:08:42,011",I have no choice.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:08:42,190","01:08:45,274",You honestly think that's gonna keep the Joker from killing people?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:08:45,443","01:08:48,894",Maybe not. but I have enough blood on my hands.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:08:49,364","01:08:54,191",And I've seen now what I would have to become to stop men like him.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:08:54,744","01:08:58,195",You once told me that if the day came when I was finished...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:08:58,373","01:09:00,449",...that we'd be together.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:09:01,167","01:09:04,334","Bruce, don't make me your one hope for a normal life."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:09:05,880","01:09:07,208",Did you mean it?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:09:08,716","01:09:10,543",Yes.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:09:27,819","01:09:29,610",Bruce.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:09:30,571","01:09:34,486","If you turn yourself in, they're not gonna let us be together."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:09:45,128","01:09:48,082",Logs as well? everything.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:09:48,256","01:09:51,625",Anything that could lead back to Lucius or Rachel.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:09:56,973","01:10:00,258","People are dying, Alfred. what would you have me do?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:10:00,435","01:10:04,183","Endure, master Wayne. take it."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:10:04,355","01:10:08,056","They'll hate you for it, but that's the point of batman."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:10:08,234","01:10:13,774",He can be the outcast. he can make the choice that no one else can make.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:10:13,948","01:10:15,277",The right choice.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:10:15,783","01:10:18,820","No, today I found out what batman can't do."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:10:18,995","01:10:20,240",He can't endure this.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:10:20,538","01:10:23,409","Today you get to say ""i told you so."""
The.Dark.Knight,"01:10:24,000","01:10:27,167","Today, I don't want to."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:10:33,009","01:10:34,468",But I did bloody tell you.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:10:37,513","01:10:40,514",I suppose they're gonna lock me up as well...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:10:41,309","01:10:42,554",...as your accomplice.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:10:42,727","01:10:47,472",Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:10:51,736","01:10:55,271","Ladies and gentlemen, I've called this press conference for two reasons."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:10:55,448","01:10:57,487","Firstly, to assure the citizens of Gotham..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:10:57,658","01:11:01,324",...that everything that can be done over the Joker killings is being done.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:11:02,705","01:11:05,790","Secondly, because the batman has offered to turn himself in."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:11:05,958","01:11:07,666",But let's consider the situation.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:11:08,044","01:11:10,665",Should we give in to this terrorist's demands?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:11:10,838","01:11:12,297",Do we really think he's gonna...?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:11:12,465","01:11:15,834",You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante than the lives of citizens?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:11:16,010","01:11:18,382",The batman is an outlaw.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:11:19,263","01:11:21,173",That's not why we demand he turn himself in...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:11:21,349","01:11:23,009",...we're doing it because we're scared.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:11:23,184","01:11:25,971",We've been happy to let batman clean up our streets till now.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:11:26,145","01:11:29,099",Things are worse than ever! amen.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:11:30,441","01:11:32,350","Yes, they are."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:11:34,862","01:11:37,863",But the night is darkest just before the dawn.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:11:40,326","01:11:42,402",And I promise you...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:11:43,204","01:11:44,615",...the dawn is coming.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:11:44,789","01:11:46,652","One day, the batman will have to"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:11:46,653","01:11:49,332",Answer for the laws he's broken. but to us..
The.Dark.Knight,"01:11:49,502","01:11:51,245",...not to this madman.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:11:51,421","01:11:53,746",- no more dead cops! yeah!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:11:57,051","01:11:58,629",He should turn himself in!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:11:58,803","01:12:01,508",Give us the batman! come on! where is he?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:12:04,392","01:12:06,550",So be it. take the batman into custody.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:12:07,020","01:12:08,977",What? is he here?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:12:09,689","01:12:10,720",I am the batman.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:12:11,065","01:12:14,066",What? come on.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:12:22,452","01:12:24,361",Alfred.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:12:25,705","01:12:27,496",Why is he letting Harvey do this?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:12:27,665","01:12:30,666",- he went down to the press conference. - I know. he just stood by.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:12:30,835","01:12:32,911",Perhaps both Bruce and mr. Dent...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:12:33,087","01:12:36,088",...believe that batman stands for something more important...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:12:36,257","01:12:38,582","...than the whims of a terrorist, miss Dawes..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:12:38,760","01:12:40,752",...even if everyone hates him for it.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:12:40,928","01:12:43,051",That's the sacrifice he's making.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:12:43,222","01:12:46,841",He's not being a hero. he's being something more.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:12:47,393","01:12:49,018","Yeah, you're absolutely right."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:12:49,187","01:12:52,271",Letting Harvey take the fall for this is not heroic at all.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:12:54,942","01:12:56,567",You know him better than anyone.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:12:56,986","01:12:58,017",I do.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:13:01,407","01:13:04,444",Will you give this to him for me? when the time is right?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:13:05,912","01:13:07,110",How will I know?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:13:07,288","01:13:08,782",It's not sealed.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:13:10,208","01:13:11,750","Goodbye, Alfred."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:13:15,922","01:13:17,665","Bye, Rachel."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:13:25,556","01:13:27,383",I didn't have time to talk this through.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:13:27,558","01:13:28,803",What are you doing?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:13:28,976","01:13:31,053",They're transferring me to central holding.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:13:31,354","01:13:32,606","This is the Joker's chance,"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:13:32,607","01:13:35,019","And when he attacks, the batman will take him down"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:13:35,191","01:13:36,733",Listen. this is too dangerous.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:13:36,901","01:13:38,150","We get this guy to county,"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:13:38,151","01:13:40,602",He's their problem. the streets will be cleared..
The.Dark.Knight,"01:13:40,780","01:13:44,481",...so let's go. the convoys stop for no reason.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:13:44,659","01:13:46,118","I hope you got some moves, pal."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:13:46,285","01:13:49,203",He's using you as bait. he doesn't know if he can get the Joker.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:13:49,372","01:13:50,451",He's failed so far.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:13:50,790","01:13:52,332",How do you know what he's thinking?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:13:52,500","01:13:54,825","I just do. anyway, this isn't just about you."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:13:55,003","01:13:56,829",What about the people depending on you...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:13:57,005","01:14:00,005",...to clean the city up and do it honorably and...?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:14:05,680","01:14:08,301",Harvey. tell everyone the truth.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:14:08,683","01:14:10,557","Heads, I go through with it."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:14:10,768","01:14:12,677",This is your life. you can't leave...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:14:12,854","01:14:15,226",...something like that to chance. - I'm not.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:14:19,569","01:14:21,976",You make your own luck.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:14:43,801","01:14:45,794","Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:14:53,436","01:14:55,761",What the hell is that?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:14:55,938","01:14:58,145","Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:14:58,316","01:15:01,519","Damn it! all units divert down onto lower fifth. I repeat, exit down."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:15:01,944","01:15:03,059",Exit down!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:15:03,237","01:15:05,563",Lower fifth? we'll be like turkeys on thanksgiving.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:15:38,272","01:15:40,598","Jesus. come on, get us out of here. let's go."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:15:42,777","01:15:45,149","Listen, we need backup. we've got company."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:15:45,321","01:15:46,863","We got trouble, guys."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:15:49,784","01:15:50,863",Lock and load!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:16:02,088","01:16:03,463",The hell was that?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:16:25,319","01:16:27,989","- these are built for that, right? - he'll need something..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:16:28,156","01:16:29,947",...a lot bigger to get through this.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:16:30,992","01:16:32,451",What is that?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:16:33,786","01:16:35,115","What is that, a bazooka?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:16:43,755","01:16:45,463",I didn't sign up for this!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:17:01,814","01:17:03,143",Look out.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:17:03,941","01:17:05,104",Look out!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:17:27,382","01:17:28,496","Come on, let's go!"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:18:15,300","01:18:17,506","Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:18:17,677","01:18:20,512","Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:18:25,435","01:18:29,017",Scanning all systems. scanning all systems.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:18:36,487","01:18:38,610","We gotta get topside. we need air support, now!"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:18:44,120","01:18:45,994",I like this job. I like it.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:18:48,249","01:18:50,870",Damage catastrophic. eject sequence initiated.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:19:04,849","01:19:06,343",Goodbye.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:19:15,443","01:19:18,646","We're on point, ready to give them some of their own medicine."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:19:25,036","01:19:27,491",That's what I'm talking about. air cav.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:19:41,052","01:19:42,760","Okay, rack them up."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:19:42,929","01:19:45,301","Rack them up, rack them up, rack them up."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:20:11,040","01:20:12,203",That's not good.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:20:15,712","01:20:16,910","Okay, that's not good!"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:21:00,048","01:21:02,124","Now, there's a batman."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:21:06,429","01:21:07,627","Ooh, you wanna play. come on."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:21:10,558","01:21:11,673",Come on.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:21:20,818","01:21:22,063",He missed!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:21:36,000","01:21:38,408",You can't stop here. we're like sitting ducks!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:21:55,436","01:21:56,516","Come on, come on."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:21:59,649","01:22:03,018","Come on. come on. I want you to do it, I want you to do it. come on!"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:22:05,571","01:22:07,030",Come on.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:22:07,699","01:22:11,032","Come on. I want you to do it, I want you to do it. come on, hit me."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:22:11,202","01:22:12,827","Come on, hit me. come on, hit me!"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:22:14,956","01:22:15,987",Hit me!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:22:44,402","01:22:46,644",Could you please just give me a minute?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:22:48,740","01:22:50,566","We got you, you son of a bitch."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:22:53,870","01:22:57,784",Gor... you do like to play things pretty close to the chest.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:22:58,249","01:22:59,957","We got him, Harvey."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:23:00,126","01:23:03,577",Mr. Dent! how does it feel to be the biggest hero in Gotham?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:23:03,755","01:23:07,040","No, I'm no hero. Gotham's finest, they're the heroes."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:23:07,216","01:23:08,545",But you and your office...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:23:08,718","01:23:10,378",...have been working with the batman all along.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:23:10,553","01:23:12,344","No, but I trusted him to do the right thing."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:23:12,513","01:23:14,589",Which was? - saving my ass.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:23:14,766","01:23:17,683","All right, people, that's enough. let him be. let him be."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:23:17,852","01:23:19,761","Thank you, detective."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:23:19,979","01:23:22,102",I've got a date with a pretty upset girlfriend.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:23:22,273","01:23:24,645","- I figured, counselor. mr. Dent, sir..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:23:24,817","01:23:28,945","...how about one for the front page, sir? mr. Dent."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:23:40,291","01:23:43,458",Stand away! all of you!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:23:43,628","01:23:47,127","I don't want anything for his mob lawyer to use, you understand?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:23:49,384","01:23:51,257",Back from the dead.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:23:51,928","01:23:53,470","I, uh..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:23:53,638","01:23:55,547",...couldn't risk my family's safety.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:23:56,849","01:23:58,676",What do we got?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:24:00,353","01:24:04,303","Nothing. no matches on prints, dna, Dental."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:24:04,482","01:24:07,234","Clothing is custom, no labels."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:24:07,443","01:24:09,566",Nothing in his pockets but knives and lint.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:24:09,737","01:24:11,646",No name.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:24:11,990","01:24:13,947","- no other alias. go home, Gordon."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:24:14,117","01:24:17,201",The clown'll keep till morning. go get some rest.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:24:17,370","01:24:19,197",You're gonna need it.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:24:19,455","01:24:22,029",Tomorrow you take the big job.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:24:22,709","01:24:25,875",You don't have any say in the matter. commissioner Gordon.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:24:41,728","01:24:43,851","I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:24:50,361","01:24:51,772",Look at these ugly bastards.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:24:51,946","01:24:53,820",- I don't feel good. you're a cop killer.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:24:53,990","01:24:56,315",You're lucky to be feeling anything below the neck.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:24:56,492","01:24:58,070",- please! - step away from the bars!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:24:58,244","01:25:00,403",My insides hurt.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:25:14,594","01:25:16,385","Did batman save you, daddy?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:25:18,556","01:25:20,845","Actually, this time..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:25:21,017","01:25:23,175",...i saved him.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:25:34,530","01:25:36,155",Has he said anything yet?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:25:43,748","01:25:47,959","Evening, commissioner."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:25:55,593","01:25:57,800",Harvey Dent never made it home.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:25:57,971","01:26:00,093",- of course not. - what have you done with him?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:26:01,015","01:26:02,759",Me?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:26:04,394","01:26:06,517",I was right here.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:26:07,939","01:26:09,766",Who did you leave him with?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:26:09,941","01:26:12,776",Hm? your people?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:26:13,903","01:26:17,237","Assuming, of course, that they are still your people..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:26:17,407","01:26:20,111",...and not Maroni's.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:26:22,328","01:26:24,700","Does it depress you, commissioner..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:26:25,123","01:26:30,081",...to know just how alone you really are?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:26:32,088","01:26:36,964",Does it make you feel responsible for Harvey Dent's current predicament?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:26:37,135","01:26:39,804",- where is he? - what's the time?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:26:40,305","01:26:41,799",What difference does that make?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:26:42,056","01:26:47,513","Well, depending on the time, he may be in one spot or several."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:26:53,901","01:26:56,855",- lf we're gonna play games... - mm-hm?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:27:00,033","01:27:01,990",...i'm gonna need a cup of coffee.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:27:02,160","01:27:06,240","Ah, the ""good cop, bad cop"" routine?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:27:06,914","01:27:07,946",Not exactly.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:27:18,468","01:27:19,799",Never start with the head.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:27:19,800","01:27:22,512",The victim gets all fuzzy. he can't feel the next..
The.Dark.Knight,"01:27:25,683","01:27:26,798",See?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:27:26,976","01:27:29,301",You wanted me. here I am.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:27:30,355","01:27:32,478",I wanted to see what you'd do.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:27:33,024","01:27:35,597",And you didn't disappoint.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:27:35,777","01:27:38,612",You let five people die.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:27:39,572","01:27:43,237",Then you let Dent take your place.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:27:43,409","01:27:46,031","- even to a guy like me, that's cold. - where's Dent?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:27:46,204","01:27:50,996",Those mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:27:51,501","01:27:56,246",But I know the truth. there's no going back. you've changed things.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:27:56,422","01:27:58,830",- forever. - then why do you wanna kill me?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:28:01,803","01:28:03,213",I don't wanna kill you.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:28:03,721","01:28:08,264","What would I do without you? go back to ripping off mob dealers? no, no."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:28:08,434","01:28:10,806","No. no, you..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:28:10,979","01:28:13,386",You complete me.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:28:13,564","01:28:15,566",- you're garbage who kills for money.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:28:15,567","01:28:17,894",- don't talk like one of them. you're not
The.Dark.Knight,"01:28:18,069","01:28:20,477",Even if you'd like to be.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:28:21,739","01:28:23,566","To them, you're just a freak..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:28:24,492","01:28:25,820",...like me.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:28:25,994","01:28:28,282",They need you right now...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:28:28,871","01:28:30,911",...but when they don't...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:28:31,457","01:28:34,494",...they'll cast you out like a leper.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:28:34,669","01:28:38,583","You see, their morals, their code..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:28:38,840","01:28:40,998",...it's a bad joke.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:28:41,259","01:28:44,592",Dropped at the first sign of trouble.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:28:45,263","01:28:49,261",They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show you.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:28:49,434","01:28:52,600","When the chips are down, these..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:28:52,770","01:28:55,012",These civilized people...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:28:55,189","01:28:57,265",...they'll eat each other.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:28:57,984","01:29:00,356","See, I'm not a monster."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:29:01,738","01:29:03,018",I'm just ahead of the curve.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:29:05,283","01:29:06,362",Where's Dent?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:29:06,534","01:29:09,452","You have all these rules, and you think they'll save you."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:29:12,540","01:29:14,948",- he's in control. - I have one rule.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:29:15,126","01:29:18,210",Oh. then that's the rule you'll have to break to know the truth.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:29:18,379","01:29:19,542",Which is?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:29:19,714","01:29:22,122",The only sensible way to live is without rules.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:29:22,300","01:29:24,969",And tonight you're gonna break your one rule.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:29:25,136","01:29:26,167",I'm considering it.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:29:26,346","01:29:28,967","There's only minutes left, so you'll have to play my game..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:29:29,140","01:29:31,713",...if you wanna save one of them.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:29:32,226","01:29:33,258","""them""?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:29:33,436","01:29:37,481","You know, for a while there, I thought you really were Dent."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:29:37,649","01:29:40,270",The way you threw yourself after her.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:29:46,574","01:29:47,653",Look at you go.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:29:53,289","01:29:56,872",Does Harvey know about you and his little bunny?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:29:57,794","01:29:59,169",Where are they?!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:29:59,337","01:30:01,329",Killing is making a choice.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:30:01,506","01:30:04,590",- where are they?! - choose between one life or the other.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:30:05,343","01:30:09,590","Your friend the district attorney, or his blushing bride-to-be."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:30:14,769","01:30:18,849","You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:30:19,273","01:30:22,773",Nothing to do with all your strength.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:30:22,986","01:30:26,401","Don't worry, I'm gonna tell you where they are, both of them."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:30:26,572","01:30:29,609",And that's the point. you'll have to choose.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:30:30,368","01:30:33,203",He's at 25052nd street...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:30:33,371","01:30:36,704",...and she's on avenue x at cicero.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:30:38,793","01:30:40,536",- which one you going after? - Rachel.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:30:41,963","01:30:43,374",We're getting Dent!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:30:45,633","01:30:48,468",25052nd street!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:30:51,389","01:30:53,216",Hello?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:30:54,183","01:30:56,556",Can anybody hear me?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:30:58,980","01:31:01,601",Hello!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:31:05,611","01:31:07,853",- Rachel? - Harvey.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:31:08,031","01:31:10,237","Oh, Harvey, thank god. are you okay?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:31:10,408","01:31:11,986",I'm all right. I'm in a...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:31:12,160","01:31:15,742",I'm in a warehouse.They got me wired to these oil drums.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:31:16,789","01:31:17,987",I am too.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:31:18,541","01:31:20,249",Harvey.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:31:27,508","01:31:29,964",I want my phone call.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:31:30,136","01:31:32,923",I want it. I want it.I want my phone call.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:31:33,598","01:31:35,425",That's nice.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:31:36,934","01:31:41,762",How many of your friends have I killed?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:31:45,526","01:31:46,606",I'm a 20-year man...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:31:46,778","01:31:50,229",...and I know the difference between punks who need a lesson in manners...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:31:50,406","01:31:53,277",...and the freaks like you who would just enjoy it.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:31:54,160","01:31:56,616",And you killed six of my friends.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:31:56,788","01:31:57,819",Six?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:31:57,997","01:32:00,453",Please. My insides hurt.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:32:00,625","01:32:02,368",I don't really care. Back away.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:32:02,543","01:32:05,710",The boss said he'd make the voices go away.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:32:05,880","01:32:09,415",He said he'd go inside and replace them with bright lights...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:32:09,592","01:32:10,707",...like Christmas.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:32:10,885","01:32:13,423","You're out of your mind, pal. Back off."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:32:13,596","01:32:16,431",Medic to the holding tank.Come on. Get the door open.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:32:16,641","01:32:17,803","You guys, back off!"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:32:17,976","01:32:20,134","Listen, we don't have a lot of time."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:32:20,311","01:32:24,309",They told me that only one of us was gonna make it...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:32:24,482","01:32:27,816",...and that they were gonna let our friends choose.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:32:30,530","01:32:32,653","Okay, Rachel."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:32:33,241","01:32:36,361",It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be all right.They're coming for you.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:32:36,536","01:32:40,830",Listen to me. I'll help you. Just talk me through what's going on with you.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:32:40,999","01:32:42,908","Can you find something,anything, sharp?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:32:43,084","01:32:44,495",I'm trying.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:32:44,669","01:32:46,827",- What's...?- Shit.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:32:47,005","01:32:48,499",Harvey?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:32:52,260","01:32:53,920","Harvey, what's happening?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:33:03,271","01:33:07,103","All available units,converge at 25052nd Street."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:33:07,442","01:33:11,522",Do you wanna know why I use a knife?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:33:13,823","01:33:15,151",Guns are too quick.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:33:15,325","01:33:18,694",You can't savor all the...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:33:18,870","01:33:22,203",...little emotions.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:33:24,125","01:33:29,001","You see, in their last moments..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:33:29,172","01:33:31,460",...people show you who they really are.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:33:32,550","01:33:38,220","So in a way, I knew your friends better than you ever did."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:33:41,976","01:33:45,392",Would you like to know which of them were cowards?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:33:51,903","01:33:53,563",What's that?Jeez.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:33:53,780","01:33:55,819",He's got some kind of a...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:33:55,990","01:33:59,193",...contusion.- I know you're gonna enjoy this.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:34:00,578","01:34:04,327",I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it even more.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:34:11,881","01:34:12,912",Just put it down.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:34:13,091","01:34:15,878",Take it easy. Take it easy.Drop the weapon now!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:34:16,052","01:34:20,002","- It's my own damn fault, just shoot him!- Let him go now! Drop it!"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:34:20,306","01:34:23,307",- What? Sorry?- What do you want?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:34:24,352","01:34:26,261",I just want my phone call.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:34:29,273","01:34:31,943",What...? What...? What's happening?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:34:32,110","01:34:34,945","Just talk to me, just for one second."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:34:37,281","01:34:39,951",- All right?- Right.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:34:51,754","01:34:53,794",Is that a phone?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:35:03,474","01:35:04,803",Mount the curb!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:35:12,817","01:35:16,815","Harvey, just in case,I wanna tell you something, okay?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:35:16,988","01:35:18,779",Don 't think like that. They're coming.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:35:18,948","01:35:21,237","I know they are,but I don't want them to."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:35:25,663","01:35:29,743","I don't wanna live without you,and I do have an answer for you."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:35:30,168","01:35:31,911",My answer is yes.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:35:34,672","01:35:37,424",No! No! No!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:35:37,592","01:35:40,213",Not me! Why are you coming for me?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:35:40,386","01:35:41,417",No!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:35:43,097","01:35:44,675",Rachel! Rachel!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:35:44,891","01:35:47,216",- Harvey.- No! No! Rachel!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:35:47,393","01:35:48,425",Okay.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:35:48,603","01:35:49,682",Rachel!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:35:50,104","01:35:51,646",No! No!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:35:51,814","01:35:55,942","Harvey, it's okay. It's all right. Listen."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:35:56,110","01:35:57,439",Somewh...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:36:03,326","01:36:04,524","No, commissioner!"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:36:04,702","01:36:07,372",Rachel! No!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:36:21,719","01:36:22,834",Hello there.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:36:28,726","01:36:32,226","Back at the MCU, the Joker's gone."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:36:33,147","01:36:34,855",With Lau?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:36:37,652","01:36:40,225",The Joker planned to be caught.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:36:40,571","01:36:42,730",He wanted me to lock him up in the MCU.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:37:02,385","01:37:04,424",Dear Bruce:
The.Dark.Knight,"01:37:06,180","01:37:08,718",I need to be honest and clear.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:37:10,768","01:37:13,306",I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:37:13,479","01:37:17,394","I love him, and I wanna spend the rest of my life with him."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:37:17,942","01:37:22,355","When I told you that if Gotham no longer needed Batman, we could be together..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:37:22,530","01:37:24,736",... I meant it.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:37:24,991","01:37:29,736",But now I'm sure the day won 't come when you no longer need Batman.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:37:30,788","01:37:32,698",I hope it does.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:37:32,874","01:37:35,625","And if it does, I will be there..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:37:36,169","01:37:37,579",... but as your friend.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:37:38,296","01:37:40,538","I'm sorry, Harvey."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:37:40,715","01:37:43,087",I'm sorry to let you down.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:37:43,259","01:37:48,254","If you lose your faith in me,please keep your faith in people."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:37:48,848","01:37:53,261","Love, now and always, Rachel."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:38:01,235","01:38:03,561",Prepared a little breakfast.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:38:07,700","01:38:09,609","- Very well, then.- Alfred."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:38:09,786","01:38:10,948","Yes, Master Wayne?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:38:12,330","01:38:14,572",Did I bring this on her?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:38:15,625","01:38:17,831",I was meant to inspire good...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:38:18,002","01:38:20,374","...not madness, not death."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:38:20,546","01:38:25,173",You have inspired good. But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:38:25,343","01:38:27,419",Didn't you think there might be casualties?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:38:27,595","01:38:30,003",Things always get worse before they get better.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:38:30,348","01:38:31,807","But Rachel, Alfred."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:38:31,975","01:38:35,759",Rachel believed in what you stood for...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:38:35,937","01:38:37,846",...what we stand for.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:38:38,022","01:38:39,481",Gotham needs you.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:38:40,024","01:38:42,978","No, Gotham needs its true hero..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:38:43,486","01:38:47,614",...and I let that murdering psychopath blow him half to hell.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:38:47,782","01:38:50,107","Which is why, for now..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:38:50,910","01:38:52,819",...they're gonna have to make do with you.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:38:55,039","01:38:56,866","She was gonna wait for me, Alfred."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:38:58,876","01:39:00,916",Dent doesn't know.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:39:01,087","01:39:02,367",He can never know.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:39:04,799","01:39:06,424",What's that?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:39:06,592","01:39:09,546",- it can wait. - that bandit...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:39:10,013","01:39:12,136",...in the forest in burma.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:39:12,307","01:39:14,346",- did you catch him? - yes.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:39:14,517","01:39:15,845",How?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:39:17,270","01:39:18,894",We burned the forest down.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:39:58,144","01:40:00,765","He's credible, an m & a lawyer from a leading consultancy."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:40:00,938","01:40:04,307",He says he's waited as long as he can for batman to do the right thing.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:40:04,484","01:40:06,560",Now he's taking matters into his own hands.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:40:06,736","01:40:09,690",We'll be live at 5 with the true identity of the batman.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:40:26,130","01:40:27,755",I'm sorry about Rachel.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:40:30,468","01:40:32,607",The doctor says you're in agonizing
The.Dark.Knight,"01:40:32,608","01:40:35,296","Pain, but that you won't accept medication"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:40:36,349","01:40:38,306",That you're refusing to...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:40:38,476","01:40:40,219",...accept skin grafts.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:40:40,561","01:40:42,803",Remember that name...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:40:43,398","01:40:45,723",...you all had for me...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:40:46,192","01:40:49,027",...when I was at internal affairs?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:40:51,489","01:40:52,769","What was it, Gordon?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:40:53,449","01:40:54,825","Harvey, i..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:40:54,993","01:40:56,487",Say it.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:40:57,912","01:40:59,821",Say it!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:41:07,505","01:41:10,589",Two-face. Harvey two-face.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:41:12,176","01:41:16,470",Why should I hide who I am?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:41:17,682","01:41:19,010",I know you tried to warn me.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:41:19,892","01:41:21,090",I'm sorry.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:41:21,728","01:41:24,349",Wuertz picked you up. was he working for them?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:41:26,649","01:41:29,021",Do you know who picked up Rachel?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:41:29,861","01:41:32,862","Harvey, I need to know which of my men I can trust."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:41:33,239","01:41:35,362",Why would you listen to me now?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:41:36,492","01:41:38,152","I'm sorry, Harvey."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:41:40,705","01:41:42,496",No.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:41:42,957","01:41:45,080","No, you're not."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:41:46,127","01:41:47,372",Not yet.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:41:52,634","01:41:55,338","This craziness, it's too much."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:41:55,553","01:41:58,803",Should've thought about that before you let the clown out of the box.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:41:58,973","01:42:00,717",You want him?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:42:03,186","01:42:05,511",I can tell you where he'll be this afternoon.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:42:13,571","01:42:15,860",Not so crazy as you look.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:42:16,032","01:42:19,780","I told you, I'm a man of my word."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:42:22,997","01:42:24,242",Where is the italian?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:42:24,415","01:42:27,535",All tactical units will converge on the location in 20 minutes.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:42:27,710","01:42:31,162",I want auxiliary units to cover all possible getaway routes.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:42:31,756","01:42:32,919",Please.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:42:33,091","01:42:36,424","Joker-man, what you do with all your money?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:42:37,095","01:42:39,764","You see, I'm a guy of simple taste."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:42:39,931","01:42:41,591",I enjoy...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:42:41,766","01:42:43,141",...dynamite...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:42:43,309","01:42:44,851",...and gunpowder...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:42:45,311","01:42:47,719",...and gasoline.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:42:49,190","01:42:51,432","- what the...? - ah, ah, ah."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:42:53,277","01:42:56,113",And you know the thing that they have in common?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:42:56,614","01:42:57,895",They're cheap.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:42:58,074","01:43:00,743",How much are they paying you to say who batman is?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:43:00,910","01:43:04,860","This is our chance. I want Lau alive. the Joker, either way."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:43:05,039","01:43:06,450","Hey, Jim. get a load of this."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:43:06,624","01:43:07,953",Let's take the next caller.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:43:08,126","01:43:10,284",Harvey Dent didn 't wanna give in to this maniac.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:43:10,461","01:43:11,742",You think you know better?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:43:11,921","01:43:15,290","I think that if we could talk to Dent today, he may feel differently."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:43:15,466","01:43:19,546","And we wish him a speedy recovery. because god knows, we need him now."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:43:19,721","01:43:21,927",You said you were a man of your word.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:43:22,223","01:43:24,263","Oh, I am."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:43:25,977","01:43:28,646",I'm only burning my half.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:43:29,981","01:43:32,104",All you care about is money.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:43:32,275","01:43:35,726",This town deserves a better class of criminal...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:43:35,903","01:43:38,145",...and I'm gonna give it to them.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:43:38,948","01:43:41,439",Tell your men they work for me now.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:43:41,617","01:43:43,990",This is my city.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:43:44,662","01:43:47,200",They won't work for a freak.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:43:47,373","01:43:49,081","""freak."""
The.Dark.Knight,"01:43:49,250","01:43:51,706",Why don't we cut you up into little pieces...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:43:51,878","01:43:53,336",...and feed you to your pooches? hm?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:43:53,504","01:43:56,375",And then we'll see how loyal a hungry dog really is.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:43:58,384","01:44:00,709",It's not about money...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:44:00,887","01:44:04,090",...it's about sending a message.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:44:04,891","01:44:07,346",Everything Burns.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:44:09,854","01:44:12,012",- who is this? I had a vision...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:44:12,190","01:44:14,941",... of a world without batman.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:44:15,109","01:44:17,351",The mob ground out a little profit...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:44:17,528","01:44:21,443",... and the police tried to shut them down one block at a time.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:44:21,616","01:44:24,901",And it was so boring.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:44:25,078","01:44:27,035",I've had a change of heart.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:44:27,205","01:44:29,826",I don 't want mr. Reese spoiling everything...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:44:29,999","01:44:34,708",... but why should I have all the fun? let's give someone else a chance.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:44:34,879","01:44:39,707",If Coleman Reese isn 't dead in 60 minutes...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:44:39,884","01:44:41,960",... then I blow up a hospital.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:44:42,136","01:44:43,714",Call in every officer.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:44:43,888","01:44:47,222",Tell them to head to their nearest hospital and start evac and search.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:44:47,392","01:44:49,515","Call the transit authority, school board, prisons."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:44:49,686","01:44:51,310",Get every bus down to a hospital.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:44:51,479","01:44:53,347",The priority is Gotham general.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:44:53,348","01:44:56,058",Wheel everybody out of that place right now
The.Dark.Knight,"01:44:56,234","01:44:57,894","You, you and you, you come with me."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:44:58,069","01:44:59,943","- where are we going, sir? - to get Reese."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:45:00,279","01:45:03,364","I need you plugged in, checking Gordon's men and their families."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:45:03,533","01:45:05,739",- looking for? - hospital admissions.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:45:05,910","01:45:07,570",Will you be wanting the batpod?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:45:07,745","01:45:09,702",In the middle of the day? not very subtle.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:45:09,872","01:45:11,153","The lamborghini, then."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:45:12,083","01:45:13,198",Much more subtle.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:45:27,056","01:45:29,547",Excuse me. let me through. excuse me. okay.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:45:29,726","01:45:33,225","Sir, could you help, please?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:45:33,396","01:45:35,104",I'm gonna find a bus for him.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:45:37,066","01:45:38,940","Sir? commissioner, do you really think..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:45:39,110","01:45:41,268",...an ordinary citizen would try to kill this man?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:45:45,783","01:45:48,109",Sir. commissioner.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:45:50,204","01:45:52,411",Get the cars around the back!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:45:54,792","01:45:56,121","Go. keep rolling, Sam."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:46:02,091","01:46:04,048",I see O'brien and Richards.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:46:04,636","01:46:08,135",No immediate family member admitted to a Gotham hospital.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:46:09,432","01:46:12,967","They're trying to kill me. - well, maybe batman can save you."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:46:26,115","01:46:28,737","Davis, they got space. bring him out."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:46:30,411","01:46:32,203",Davis.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:46:37,335","01:46:39,660",I saw Burns and Zachary.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:46:39,837","01:46:41,035",Nothing on them.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:46:41,214","01:46:42,672",And a patrolman I don't know.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:46:43,883","01:46:45,792","Okay, so, what now?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:46:46,678","01:46:48,919",What do we do now? where are we going?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:46:51,683","01:46:53,343",Send the information to Gordon.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:47:01,234","01:47:02,776",Get out of here.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:47:04,821","01:47:06,612",Davis.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:47:09,784","01:47:12,192","Ma'am, we're gonna have to move him now."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:47:23,881","01:47:26,207","It's Berg, isn't it? - commissioner."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:47:27,343","01:47:28,802","You okay, son?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:47:53,244","01:47:54,738",You know...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:47:55,580","01:47:58,664","...i don't want there to be any hard feelings between us, Harvey."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:47:58,833","01:48:01,953",- when you and... - Rachel!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:48:02,128","01:48:04,417",- Rachel were being abducted...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:48:04,589","01:48:07,590",...i was sitting in Gordon's cage.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:48:07,925","01:48:09,835",I didn't rig those charges.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:48:10,053","01:48:12,508","Your men, your plan."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:48:12,722","01:48:15,178",Do I really look like a guy with a plan?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:48:15,600","01:48:18,387",You know what I am? I'm a dog chasing cars.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:48:19,020","01:48:21,475",I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:48:21,648","01:48:24,767",You know? I just do things.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:48:25,151","01:48:28,852",The mob has plans. the cops have plans.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:48:29,030","01:48:31,236",Gordon's got plans.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:48:31,407","01:48:34,361","You know, they're schemers."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:48:34,535","01:48:38,284",Schemers trying to control their little worlds.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:48:38,456","01:48:39,950",I'm not a schemer.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:48:40,124","01:48:41,749",I try to show the schemers...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:48:41,918","01:48:47,208",...how pathetic their attempts to control things really are.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:48:48,174","01:48:51,210",So when I say... ah. come here.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:48:51,719","01:48:55,254",When I say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:48:56,808","01:48:59,014",...you'll know that I'm telling the truth.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:49:01,521","01:49:04,308",- I'm gonna need your weapon. - what?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:49:08,069","01:49:09,896",Why? because my wife's in the hospital?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:49:10,613","01:49:12,155","Yeah, that'd be why."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:49:13,074","01:49:16,277",It's the schemers that put you where you are.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:49:16,452","01:49:20,236","You were a schemer, you had plans..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:49:20,415","01:49:22,573",...and look where that got you.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:49:33,344","01:49:35,716",Police are taking every precaution...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:49:35,888","01:49:38,011",... urging people not to take matters into their hands.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:49:38,182","01:49:40,720",I just did what I do best.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:49:40,893","01:49:44,512",I took your little plan and I turned it on itself.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:49:44,689","01:49:47,115",Look what I did to this city with a
The.Dark.Knight,"01:49:47,116","01:49:50,028",Few drums of gas and a couple of bullets
The.Dark.Knight,"01:49:50,194","01:49:53,480",Hm? you know what I noticed?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:49:53,656","01:49:57,191","Nobody panics when things go ""according to plan."""
The.Dark.Knight,"01:49:57,368","01:49:59,028",Even if the plan is horrifying.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:49:59,662","01:50:04,704","If tomorrow I tell the press that, like, a gangbanger will get shot..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:50:04,876","01:50:08,327",...or a truckload of soldiers will be blowing up...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:50:08,629","01:50:09,709",...nobody panics.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:50:10,423","01:50:13,507",Because it's all part of the plan.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:50:13,676","01:50:18,587",But when I say that one little old mayor will die...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:50:18,848","01:50:21,256","...well, then, everyone loses their minds."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:50:24,687","01:50:27,605",Introduce a little anarchy...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:50:28,775","01:50:31,016",...upset the established order...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:50:31,194","01:50:35,737",...and everything becomes chaos.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:50:37,575","01:50:40,327",I'm an agent of chaos.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:50:40,703","01:50:43,028","Oh, and you know the thing about chaos?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:50:45,083","01:50:46,707",It's fair.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:50:55,927","01:50:59,094",- you live. - mm-hm.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:50:59,597","01:51:01,222",You die.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:51:01,432","01:51:03,425",Mmm. now we're talking.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:51:12,777","01:51:14,271",Mr. Reese.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:51:32,463","01:51:34,622","That's mr. Wayne, isn't it?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:51:34,799","01:51:37,800",- that was a very brave thing you did. - trying to catch the light?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:51:38,136","01:51:40,971",- you weren't protecting the van? - why? who's in it?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:51:46,436","01:51:48,512",Don't you think I should go to the hospital?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:51:48,688","01:51:51,179","Don't watch a whole lot of news, do you, mr. Wayne?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:52:57,340","01:52:59,167",Southeast.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:52:59,342","01:53:01,548",It's Gotham general.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:53:02,303","01:53:03,963",- did you clear the building? yeah.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:53:06,975","01:53:08,682",You must know how many were inside.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:53:08,851","01:53:10,227","You have patient lists, roll call."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:53:10,395","01:53:12,720",Right now we're showing 50 people missing. one bus.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:53:12,897","01:53:16,064",The other buses were heading off to hospitals. I guess we missed one.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:53:16,234","01:53:18,357",What's your guess about where Harvey Dent is?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:53:18,528","01:53:22,988","Keep looking. and keep it to yourself. anybody asks, we got him out."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:53:25,576","01:53:27,984",Get me the mayor's office on the line.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:53:29,163","01:53:30,907",We're gonna need the national guard.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:53:31,082","01:53:32,706",- people are still missing...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:53:32,875","01:53:34,073",... including gcn's own Mike Engel.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:53:34,252","01:53:37,502",I'm now being told that we're cutting to a video gcn has just received.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:53:37,672","01:53:39,581",I'm Mike Engel for Gotham tonight.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:53:40,091","01:53:43,425","""what does it take to make you people wanna join in?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:53:43,594","01:53:46,168",You failed to kill the lawyer. I've gotta get you off the bench...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:53:46,347","01:53:48,091",...and into the game. bench. game.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:53:50,268","01:53:52,391","Come nightfall, this city is mine. mine."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:53:52,562","01:53:55,313",- and anyone left here plays by my rules. - rules.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:53:55,606","01:53:58,940",Mr. Fox? security is showing a break-in at the r & d department.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:53:59,110","01:54:01,233",If you don 't wanna be in the game...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:54:01,404","01:54:02,779",...get out now. - get out now.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:54:04,949","01:54:07,903",But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd are sure in for a surprise.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:54:43,655","01:54:44,935",Gotham p.d. has shut down...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:54:45,114","01:54:47,570",Sweet jesus. ...the area 's bridges and tunnels.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:54:47,742","01:54:51,158","Shouldn't you be out there, you know, doing something?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:54:51,329","01:54:53,286",It's my day off.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:54:53,915","01:54:55,492",I gotta take a leak.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:54:55,667","01:54:57,992","Keep an eye out for me, will you?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:55:03,591","01:55:05,548",Now what? need someone to shake it for you?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:55:05,718","01:55:07,296",Hello.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:55:08,012","01:55:09,506",Dent.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:55:09,681","01:55:11,887",Jesus. I thought you was dead.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:55:12,058","01:55:13,718",Half.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:55:19,774","01:55:21,352","Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:55:21,526","01:55:23,518",- it must've been Maroni's men. - shut up!
The.Dark.Knight,"01:55:25,279","01:55:27,402",Are you telling me that you're gonna protect...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:55:27,573","01:55:29,317",...the other traitor in Gordon's unit?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:55:29,492","01:55:30,951","I don't know, he never told me."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:55:31,119","01:55:32,518","Listen, Dent, I swear to god,"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:55:32,519","01:55:34,737",I didn't know what they were gonna do to you
The.Dark.Knight,"01:55:36,290","01:55:37,453",That's funny...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:55:39,210","01:55:41,962",...because I don't know what's gonna happen to you either.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:55:46,092","01:55:48,001","Beautiful, isn't it?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:55:48,386","01:55:50,046",Beautiful.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:55:50,596","01:55:51,711",Unethical.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:55:52,890","01:55:54,433",Dangerous.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:55:54,642","01:55:58,142",You've turned every cell phone in Gotham into a microphone.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:55:58,313","01:56:00,720",And a high-frequency generator-receiver.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:56:00,898","01:56:05,975",You took my sonar concept and applied it to every phone in the city.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:56:06,154","01:56:10,732","With half the city feeding you sonar, you can image all of Gotham."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:56:12,660","01:56:14,036",This is wrong.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:56:14,203","01:56:16,243","I've gotta find this man, Lucius."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:56:18,249","01:56:19,530",At what cost?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:56:19,709","01:56:22,496",The database is null-key encrypted.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:56:22,670","01:56:24,877",It can only be accessed by one person.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:56:26,215","01:56:28,374",This is too much power for one person.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:56:28,551","01:56:30,709",That's why I gave it to you.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:56:31,179","01:56:32,377",Only you can use it.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:56:32,555","01:56:36,339",Spying on 30 million people isn't part of my job description.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:56:38,561","01:56:39,714",This is an audio Sample.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:56:39,715","01:56:42,262",If he talks within range of any phone in the city..
The.Dark.Knight,"01:56:42,440","01:56:44,646",...you can triangulate his position.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:56:45,109","01:56:47,600",I'll help you this one time.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:56:48,071","01:56:49,862",But consider this my resignation.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:56:50,031","01:56:54,609","As long as this machine is at Wayne enterprises, I won't be."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:56:55,370","01:56:57,279",When you're finished...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:56:57,955","01:56:59,070",...type in your name.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:57:07,674","01:57:10,758",My officers are going over every inch of the tunnels and bridges...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:57:10,927","01:57:14,130","...but with the Joker's threat, they're not an option."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:57:14,305","01:57:17,140",- and land routes east? - backed up for hours.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:57:17,308","01:57:20,926","Which leaves the ferries with 30,000 ready to board."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:57:21,104","01:57:24,140",I wanna use the ferries so I can get those prisoners off the island.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:57:24,482","01:57:27,269",The men you put away? those aren't people I'm worried about.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:57:27,443","01:57:29,566",You should be. whatever the Joker's planning...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:57:29,737","01:57:31,791",...it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners
The.Dark.Knight,"01:57:31,792","01:57:34,233",Are involved. I wanna get them out of here
The.Dark.Knight,"01:57:35,702","01:57:36,900",So where is Harvey?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:57:37,495","01:57:40,662","- we haven't found him. - oh, jesus."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:57:44,502","01:57:46,578",How long can you keep this quiet?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:58:00,685","01:58:03,354","Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:58:04,188","01:58:06,347",Going to join your wife?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:58:09,861","01:58:12,352",- you love her? - yes.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:58:13,239","01:58:16,193",You ever imagine what it would be like to listen to her die?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:58:16,367","01:58:17,861","Look, take it up with the Joker."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:58:18,036","01:58:21,286",He killed your woman. he made you...
The.Dark.Knight,"01:58:21,456","01:58:22,487",...like this.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:58:22,874","01:58:25,875",The Joker's just a mad dog.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:58:26,044","01:58:28,665",I want whoever let him off the leash.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:58:29,380","01:58:32,714","I took care of Wuertz, but who was your other man inside Gordon's unit?"
The.Dark.Knight,"01:58:32,884","01:58:35,505",Who picked up Rachel? must have been someone she trusted.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:58:36,721","01:58:38,844","Look, if I tell you..."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:58:39,015","01:58:40,046",...will you let me go?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:58:40,808","01:58:42,137",Can't hurt your chances.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:58:44,896","01:58:46,556",It was Ramirez.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:58:51,986","01:58:55,236",- but you said... - I said it couldn't hurt your chances.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:58:58,826","01:59:00,949",You're a lucky man.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:59:04,415","01:59:06,159",- but he's not. - who?
The.Dark.Knight,"01:59:09,087","01:59:10,497",Your driver.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:59:23,726","01:59:24,758",Stand back.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:59:24,936","01:59:27,261","Hey, that ain't right. we should be on that boat."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:59:27,438","01:59:30,012",You wanna ride across with them? be my guest.
The.Dark.Knight,"01:59:53,256","01:59:54,964","Sir, they've stopped their engines."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:59:55,133","01:59:56,164","Right, get on the radio."
The.Dark.Knight,"01:59:56,342","01:59:59,960",Tell them we'll come back and pick them up once we dump the scumbags.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:00:00,138","02:00:02,510","Liberty, this is Spirit. come in."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:00:04,559","02:00:05,757",What the heck was that?
The.Dark.Knight,"02:00:07,687","02:00:09,146",What the...?
The.Dark.Knight,"02:00:09,689","02:00:12,974","Liberty, come in, please. this is Spirit. come in."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:00:14,610","02:00:16,484","Liberty, we have the Same thing. we've lost both engines."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:00:16,654","02:00:18,148","- Liberty, come in. Fox."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:00:18,323","02:00:20,814",There's something going on on the ferries.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:00:21,576","02:00:23,865",Get down to the engine room now.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:00:24,495","02:00:26,702","Hey, buddy, what's happening?"
The.Dark.Knight,"02:00:35,298","02:00:38,749","Captain, we got a hundred barrels down there rigged to blow. and this."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:00:53,107","02:00:54,934",Looks like some kind of detonator.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:00:55,109","02:00:57,980",Why would they give us the detonator to our own bomb?
The.Dark.Knight,"02:01:00,907","02:01:02,282","Tonight, you're all gonna..."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:01:02,450","02:01:04,193",... be a part of a social experiment.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:01:08,039","02:01:11,871",Through the magic of diesel fuel and ammonium nitrate...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:01:12,043","02:01:16,123",... I'm ready right now to blow you all sky-high.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:01:16,297","02:01:18,373","Liberty, come in, over."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:01:19,842","02:01:20,874",It's dead.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:01:21,219","02:01:25,715","If anyone attempts to get off their boat, you all die."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:01:26,057","02:01:27,337",I'm zeroing in.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:01:27,517","02:01:32,060",Each of you has a remote to blow up the other boat.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:01:32,230","02:01:34,685",His voice is on the ferry...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:01:34,857","02:01:36,897",...but it's not the source.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:01:39,153","02:01:40,268",West.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:01:47,537","02:01:49,825",- Gordon. I have the Joker's location.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:01:49,998","02:01:51,077",Prewitt building.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:01:51,249","02:01:53,704",Assemble on the building opposite.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:01:55,086","02:01:57,873","At midnight, I blow you all up."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:01:58,047","02:02:03,208","If, however, one of you presses the button, I'll let that boat live."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:02:03,386","02:02:05,509",So who 's it gonna be?
The.Dark.Knight,"02:02:05,680","02:02:08,218",Harvey Dent's most-wanted scumbag collection...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:02:08,391","02:02:11,724",... or the sweet and innocent civilians?
The.Dark.Knight,"02:02:11,894","02:02:14,432",You choose.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:02:14,605","02:02:16,515","Oh, and you might wanna decide quickly..."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:02:16,691","02:02:21,020",... because the people on the other boat may not be quite so noble.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:02:28,411","02:02:29,442",Stay back.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:02:29,620","02:02:33,404","Well, now, who are you to decide? we ought to talk this over, at least."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:02:33,791","02:02:37,374",We don't all have to die. those men had their chance.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:02:38,004","02:02:41,788",- we are not going to talk about this. - why aren't we talking about it?
The.Dark.Knight,"02:02:41,966","02:02:44,540",They're talking over the Same thing on the other boat.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:02:44,719","02:02:47,008",- let's put it to a vote. yes!
The.Dark.Knight,"02:02:52,310","02:02:54,883","- hello? Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:02:55,063","02:02:58,099",Jim needs you to pack up and put the kids in the car right away.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:02:58,274","02:02:59,982",But the units outside...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:00,151","02:03:01,729",Those cops can 't be trusted.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:01,903","02:03:04,857",Jim needs you away from them as soon as possible.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:05,031","02:03:07,985","I'll call them off for 10 minutes, and you'll have to move fast."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:08,159","02:03:11,991",- but where am I supposed to take them? - 25052nd street.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:12,163","02:03:14,037",Leave as soon as the patrol car pulls out.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:14,207","02:03:15,582",Okay.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:15,958","02:03:17,750",She believe you?
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:17,960","02:03:20,000",It's because she trusts you...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:20,338","02:03:21,417",...just like rachel did.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:21,589","02:03:23,665",- I didn't know... - didn't know what they'd do?
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:23,841","02:03:26,593",You're the second cop to say that to me.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:26,844","02:03:28,967",What exactly did you think they were gonna do?
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:29,138","02:03:31,380",They got me early on. my mother's hospital bills...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:31,557","02:03:34,594",- don't! - I'm sorry.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:35,144","02:03:37,600","You live to fight another day, officer."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:41,401","02:03:43,227",We found the missing hospital bus.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:43,403","02:03:45,111",Then we have a hostage situation.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:47,198","02:03:49,191",It's a shooting gallery.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:49,575","02:03:51,864",Why would he choose a spot with such big windows?
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:52,036","02:03:53,863",We have clear shots on five clowns.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:54,038","02:03:56,790","Snipers take them out, smash the windows, a team rappels in."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:57,208","02:03:58,702",Team moves in by the stairwells.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:03:58,876","02:04:00,999","Two, three casualties max."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:04:01,170","02:04:03,044",- let's do it. it's not that simple.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:04:03,214","02:04:05,539","- with the joker, it never is. - what's simple is..."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:04:05,717","02:04:08,883","...every second, those people on the ferries get closer to blowing..."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:04:09,053","02:04:11,591",- that won't happen. - then he'll blow both of them up!
The.Dark.Knight,"02:04:11,764","02:04:13,592",- we don't have time for paper ballots.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:04:13,593","02:04:15,513",- I want everybody to put their votes..
The.Dark.Knight,"02:04:15,685","02:04:17,678",...on this piece of paper.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:04:18,730","02:04:21,565","If anyone's got pens, pass it along."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:04:21,899","02:04:23,691",Thank you. anybody else?
The.Dark.Knight,"02:04:23,860","02:04:25,687",Coming through. anybody else? thank you.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:04:25,862","02:04:28,732",We need to get these votes in quickly.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:04:28,906","02:04:30,449",Come on.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:04:32,452","02:04:34,575",What are you waiting for? push the button!
The.Dark.Knight,"02:04:34,746","02:04:36,703",We're running out of time!
The.Dark.Knight,"02:04:37,999","02:04:39,826",I need five minutes alone.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:04:40,001","02:04:41,828",No! there's no time!
The.Dark.Knight,"02:04:42,003","02:04:43,414",We have clear shots!
The.Dark.Knight,"02:04:43,588","02:04:46,505",Dent is in there with them. we have to save dent!
The.Dark.Knight,"02:04:46,674","02:04:48,631",I have to save dent.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:04:48,801","02:04:49,916",Get ready.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:04:52,764","02:04:55,433","Two minutes, then we breach."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:05:01,022","02:05:02,516","Fox, I need picture."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:05:05,568","02:05:08,024","- hello? jim, we're in trouble."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:05:09,280","02:05:11,569","Okay, you got pov on alpha..."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:05:12,617","02:05:14,574",... omni on beta.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:05:16,037","02:05:19,406",Looks like clowns and hostages on two floors.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:05:19,582","02:05:21,990",There's a swa t team on the stairwell.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:05:25,296","02:05:27,918",Another swa t team on the roof.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:05:29,467","02:05:30,665",Line's clear.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:05:32,428","02:05:35,133","- barbara, calm down. - he has the kids!"
The.Dark.Knight,"02:05:35,306","02:05:38,556","Hello, jim. - harvey?"
The.Dark.Knight,"02:05:39,352","02:05:42,555",- where's my family? - where my family died.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:05:45,650","02:05:47,310","Blue team, acquire the target."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:05:48,987","02:05:51,560","Entry team, set your charge."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:06:07,505","02:06:09,332","Fox, the swa ts are targeting the wrong people."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:06:09,507","02:06:11,001",The clowns are the hostages.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:06:11,718","02:06:13,509","Red team, go! red team, go!"
The.Dark.Knight,"02:06:17,265","02:06:18,676","Entry team, blow and go!"
The.Dark.Knight,"02:06:22,770","02:06:24,181",Don't move.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:06:25,356","02:06:26,732",Take the shot.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:06:32,363","02:06:34,023",Those swats are coming in hot.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:06:34,198","02:06:36,025","Clowns, put down your guns."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:06:36,534","02:06:39,155","Drop your weapons! on the ground, now!"
The.Dark.Knight,"02:06:39,370","02:06:42,537","Doctors, get down! clear the line of fire. drop your weap..."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:07:07,148","02:07:08,311",Freeze!
The.Dark.Knight,"02:07:08,483","02:07:10,855",Stand down or you will be...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:07:14,405","02:07:15,864",Look up.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:07:16,449","02:07:19,022",See those bad guys on the floor above?
The.Dark.Knight,"02:07:19,202","02:07:22,203",They're waiting to ambush the swat team coming up the elevator.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:07:22,664","02:07:23,695",Sixty seconds.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:07:32,006","02:07:36,585","The tally is 140 against, 396 for."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:07:44,727","02:07:47,265",So go ahead. do it.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:07:47,438","02:07:49,431",We're still here.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:07:50,608","02:07:53,562",And that means they haven't killed us yet either.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:07:55,029","02:07:56,773","Go, go, go!"
The.Dark.Knight,"02:07:56,948","02:07:58,739","Blue team, cover!"
The.Dark.Knight,"02:08:04,247","02:08:05,907",Trouble on the floor above.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:08:15,258","02:08:16,633",Get down on the ground now!
The.Dark.Knight,"02:08:25,059","02:08:27,467",Freeze! stop or we will shoot.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:08:27,645","02:08:29,638",We will shoot you. drop the officer.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:08:29,814","02:08:31,356",Release the officer right now.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:08:31,524","02:08:33,481",Let him go now! on your knees!
The.Dark.Knight,"02:08:34,068","02:08:36,144",We got him. he's out of the game.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:08:36,321","02:08:38,812",Keep your hands in the air! step away from the edge!
The.Dark.Knight,"02:08:46,873","02:08:48,497",Halt!
The.Dark.Knight,"02:09:01,804","02:09:03,180",Stay down! don't move!
The.Dark.Knight,"02:09:03,348","02:09:07,641","Be advised. clowns are hostages, doctors are targets."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:09:13,941","02:09:16,100","Ah, you made it. I'm so thrilled."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:09:16,277","02:09:19,444",- where's the detonator? - go get him.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:09:32,835","02:09:35,920",Put down your weapon! don't move!
The.Dark.Knight,"02:10:07,328","02:10:09,202",You don't wanna die...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:10:09,372","02:10:12,408",...but you don't know how to take a life.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:10:12,583","02:10:14,243",Give it to me.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:10:14,544","02:10:18,873",These men will kill you and take it anyway.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:10:22,302","02:10:24,793",No one wants to get their hands dirty.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:10:24,971","02:10:27,925",Fine. I'll do it.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:10:29,600","02:10:32,305",Those men on that boat? they made their choices.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:10:32,478","02:10:34,767",They chose to murder and steal.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:10:34,939","02:10:38,142",It doesn't make any sense for us to have to die too.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:10:47,618","02:10:50,074",All the old familiar places.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:10:56,377","02:10:57,456",Stand by.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:11:07,805","02:11:11,388","Red team, floor secure. hostages are safe."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:11:11,601","02:11:13,677",Give it to me.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:11:15,104","02:11:18,853",You can tell them I took it by force.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:11:19,359","02:11:24,270","Give it to me, and I'll do what you should've did 10 minutes ago."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:11:46,344","02:11:49,677","We really should stop this fighting, otherwise we'll miss the fireworks."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:11:49,847","02:11:51,674",There won't be any fireworks.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:11:52,100","02:11:55,303",And here we go.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:12:34,642","02:12:36,551",What were you trying to prove?
The.Dark.Knight,"02:12:36,728","02:12:39,682","That deep down, everyone's as ugly as you?"
The.Dark.Knight,"02:12:40,815","02:12:41,846",You're alone.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:12:48,448","02:12:50,766",Can't rely on anyone these days.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:12:50,767","02:12:53,952",You gotta do everything yourself. don't we
The.Dark.Knight,"02:12:54,162","02:12:56,997",That's okay. I came prepared.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:12:57,206","02:12:58,858",It's a funny world we live in.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:12:58,859","02:13:01,667","Speaking of which, you know how I got these scars"
The.Dark.Knight,"02:13:01,836","02:13:04,671","No, but I know how you got these."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:13:22,482","02:13:25,233","Oh, you."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:13:25,401","02:13:28,438","You just couldn't let me go, could you?"
The.Dark.Knight,"02:13:29,572","02:13:33,486",This is what happens when an unstoppable force...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:13:33,660","02:13:38,120",...meets an immovable object.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:13:38,706","02:13:44,127","You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?"
The.Dark.Knight,"02:13:44,295","02:13:47,000",Huh? you won't kill me...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:13:47,173","02:13:53,425",...out of some misplaced sense of self-righteousness.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:13:53,596","02:13:56,799",And I won't kill you...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:13:56,975","02:14:00,759",...because you're just too much fun.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:14:01,813","02:14:05,976",I think you and I are destined to do this forever.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:14:06,150","02:14:08,143",You'll be in a padded cell forever.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:14:08,319","02:14:10,146",Maybe we could share one.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:14:10,321","02:14:11,780","You know, they'll be doubling up..."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:14:11,948","02:14:14,486",...the rate this city's inhabitants are losing their minds.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:14:14,659","02:14:17,779",This city just showed you...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:14:17,954","02:14:21,998",...that it's full of people ready to believe in good.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:14:22,166","02:14:25,333",Until their spirit breaks completely.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:14:26,212","02:14:31,040",Until they get a good look at the real harvey dent...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:14:31,217","02:14:34,004",...and all the heroic things he's done.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:14:35,680","02:14:40,721",You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle for gotham's soul...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:14:40,893","02:14:43,811",...in a fistfight with you?
The.Dark.Knight,"02:14:44,355","02:14:45,897",No.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:14:46,065","02:14:49,481",You need an ace in the hole.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:14:49,652","02:14:51,277",Mine's harvey.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:14:51,654","02:14:53,362",What did you do?
The.Dark.Knight,"02:14:53,531","02:14:56,532",I took gotham's white knight...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:14:56,701","02:15:00,319",...and I brought him down to our level.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:15:00,747","02:15:03,701","It wasn't hard. see, madness, as you know..."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:15:03,875","02:15:06,911",...is like gravity.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:15:07,086","02:15:09,412",All it takes is a little push.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:15:26,356","02:15:28,099",Dent!
The.Dark.Knight,"02:15:49,087","02:15:53,416","This is where they brought her, gordon, after your men handed her over."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:15:54,175","02:15:55,753",This is where she died.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:15:55,927","02:15:58,252","I know, I was here..."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:15:59,305","02:16:02,057",...trying to save her. - but you didn't.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:16:02,350","02:16:04,093","- I couldn't. - yes, you could've."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:16:04,268","02:16:05,763",If you'd listened to me.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:16:05,937","02:16:08,558",If you stood up against corruption...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:16:08,731","02:16:10,938",...instead of doing your deal with the devil.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:16:11,109","02:16:12,733",I was trying to fight the mob!
The.Dark.Knight,"02:16:13,236","02:16:18,064",You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself if you knew what I'd lost.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:16:19,367","02:16:22,487",Have you ever had to talk to the person you loved most...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:16:22,662","02:16:26,529","...tell them it's gonna be all right, when you know it's not?"
The.Dark.Knight,"02:16:28,209","02:16:32,076","Well, you're about to know what that feels like, gordon."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:16:32,839","02:16:36,706",Then you can look me in the eye and tell me you're sorry.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:16:38,469","02:16:42,052",- you're not going to hurt my family. - no.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:16:42,223","02:16:44,928",Just the person you love most.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:16:52,942","02:16:55,979",So is it your wife?
The.Dark.Knight,"02:16:57,071","02:16:58,731","Put the gun down, harvey."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:16:59,115","02:17:00,775","Harvey, put down the gun."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:17:00,950","02:17:04,485","Please. please, harvey. please."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:17:05,872","02:17:07,152","Oh, goddamn it."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:17:07,332","02:17:09,490",Will you stop pointing that gun at my family?
The.Dark.Knight,"02:17:10,001","02:17:11,661",No! - we have a winner.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:17:11,836","02:17:13,330","No, jim, stop him!"
The.Dark.Knight,"02:17:13,838","02:17:15,665",Harvey. don't let him...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:17:15,840","02:17:16,955",Harvey!
The.Dark.Knight,"02:17:18,343","02:17:20,216",I'm sorry!
The.Dark.Knight,"02:17:22,013","02:17:23,092",For everything.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:17:25,683","02:17:27,890",Please don't hurt my son.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:17:38,029","02:17:39,607",You brought your cops?
The.Dark.Knight,"02:17:39,781","02:17:42,651",All they know is there's a situation.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:17:42,825","02:17:45,826",They don't know who or what. they're just creating a perimeter.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:17:45,995","02:17:48,665",You think I wanna escape from this?
The.Dark.Knight,"02:17:48,831","02:17:51,583",There is no escape from this.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:17:51,751","02:17:53,874","You don't wanna hurt the boy, harvey."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:17:56,172","02:17:59,375","It's not about what I want, it's about what's fair!"
The.Dark.Knight,"02:18:00,134","02:18:04,346",You thought we could be decent men in an indecent time.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:18:07,141","02:18:08,221",But you were wrong.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:18:08,935","02:18:12,719",The world is cruel. and the only morality in a cruel world...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:18:13,481","02:18:15,390",...is chance.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:18:15,566","02:18:17,274",Unbiased.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:18:17,485","02:18:18,730",Unprejudiced.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:18:20,113","02:18:21,227",Fair.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:18:21,406","02:18:23,647",His son's got the same chance she had.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:18:24,409","02:18:25,689",Fifty-fifty.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:18:25,868","02:18:29,320",What happened to rachel wasn't chance. we decided to act.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:18:29,664","02:18:30,992",We three.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:18:31,165","02:18:34,581",Then why was it me who was the only one who lost everything?
The.Dark.Knight,"02:18:37,088","02:18:39,709",- it wasn't. - the joker chose me.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:18:39,882","02:18:42,171",Because you were the best of us.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:18:42,343","02:18:47,338",He wanted to prove that even someone as good as you...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:18:47,515","02:18:49,258",...could fall.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:18:49,600","02:18:50,881",And he was right.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:18:51,060","02:18:53,302","You're the one pointing the gun, harvey."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:18:53,479","02:18:56,516",So point it at the people responsible.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:18:57,483","02:18:59,310",Fair enough.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:19:02,655","02:19:04,529",You first.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:19:17,045","02:19:18,705",My turn.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:19:25,637","02:19:27,629","Harvey, you're right."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:19:28,681","02:19:31,303",Rachel's death was my fault.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:19:34,395","02:19:36,851",Please don't punish the boy.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:19:37,940","02:19:41,144","- please, punish me. - I'm about to."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:19:43,112","02:19:45,069","Tell your boy he's gonna be all right, gordon."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:19:45,531","02:19:47,156",Lie...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:19:47,659","02:19:48,773",...like I lied.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:19:52,538","02:19:54,116","It's going to be all right, son."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:20:32,537","02:20:35,372","Dad? daddy, is he okay?"
The.Dark.Knight,"02:20:51,889","02:20:54,048",- thank you. - you don't have to thank me.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:20:54,684","02:20:56,475","Yes, I do."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:21:00,732","02:21:02,060",The joker won.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:21:04,485","02:21:07,356","Harvey's prosecution, everything he fought for..."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:21:07,905","02:21:09,649",...undone.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:21:10,158","02:21:12,517",Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
The.Dark.Knight,"02:21:12,518","02:21:15,069",Our city dies with harvey's reputation
The.Dark.Knight,"02:21:15,246","02:21:16,409",We bet it all on him.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:21:17,749","02:21:20,619",The joker took the best of us and tore him down.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:21:21,210","02:21:22,621",People will lose hope.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:21:22,795","02:21:24,539",They won't.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:21:27,050","02:21:28,923",They must never know what he did.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:21:29,093","02:21:30,920",Five dead.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:21:31,220","02:21:32,501",Two of them cops.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:21:32,680","02:21:35,136",- you can't sweep that... - no.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:21:39,937","02:21:42,773",But the joker cannot win.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:21:48,029","02:21:51,232",Gotham needs its true hero.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:21:57,622","02:22:00,658",- no. - you either die a hero...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:22:00,833","02:22:05,294",...or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:22:05,463","02:22:07,290",I can do those things...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:22:07,715","02:22:10,752","...because I'm not a hero, not like dent."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:22:13,763","02:22:16,634",I killed those people. that's what I can be.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:22:16,808","02:22:18,717","No, no, you can't. you're not."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:22:18,893","02:22:21,467",I'm whatever gotham needs me to be.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:22:23,147","02:22:24,262",Call it in.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:22:27,568","02:22:29,312",A hero.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:22:29,487","02:22:32,737","Not the hero we deserved, but the hero we needed."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:22:33,324","02:22:35,862",Nothing less than a knight...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:22:36,411","02:22:38,119",...shining.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:22:38,746","02:22:40,371",They'll hunt you.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:22:40,540","02:22:42,331",You'll hunt me.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:22:42,834","02:22:44,791",You'll condemn me.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:22:45,503","02:22:47,792",Set the dogs on me.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:22:51,551","02:22:53,839",Because that's what needs to happen.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:22:55,013","02:22:56,922",Because sometimes...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:22:57,098","02:22:59,256",... the truth isn 't good enough.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:23:00,143","02:23:02,431",Sometimes people deserve more.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:23:05,898","02:23:09,813",Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:23:28,212","02:23:29,872",Batman.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:23:31,799","02:23:33,543",Batman!
The.Dark.Knight,"02:23:34,344","02:23:36,301","Why's he running, dad?"
The.Dark.Knight,"02:23:37,347","02:23:38,675",Because we have to chase him.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:23:38,848","02:23:41,719","Okay, we're going in! go, go! move!"
The.Dark.Knight,"02:23:47,815","02:23:49,393",He didn't do anything wrong.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:23:52,153","02:23:57,740","Because he's the hero gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now."
The.Dark.Knight,"02:23:59,160","02:24:00,191",So we'll hunt him...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:24:03,331","02:24:05,407",... because he can take it.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:24:07,919","02:24:10,410",Because he's not our hero.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:24:17,971","02:24:19,169",He's a silent guardian...
The.Dark.Knight,"02:24:20,348","02:24:22,222",...a watchful protector.
The.Dark.Knight,"02:24:24,727","02:24:26,008",A dark knight.
