"00:00:58,717","00:01:02,717",
"00:01:14,657","00:01:17,203",My dad was a farmer.
"00:01:18,098","00:01:21,270",Like everybody else back then.
"00:01:22,926","00:01:25,125",Of course he didn't start that way.
"00:01:30,453","00:01:32,607",The computer says you're too tight.
"00:01:32,716","00:01:35,568","No, I got this! -Crossing the Straits."
"00:01:38,345","00:01:40,226",I've got to shut it down Cooper. -Heyyy.
"00:01:41,543","00:01:44,279","Shutting all down... -Hey, we do not have to shut down  anything!"
"00:01:48,279","00:01:49,339",Dad?
"00:01:54,771","00:01:58,747",Sorry Murph. Go back to bed babe.
"00:01:58,900","00:02:00,458",I thought you were the ghost.
"00:02:03,017","00:02:07,082",There's no such thing as a ghost babe. -Grandpa says that you can get ghosts.
"00:02:08,349","00:02:10,854","No, that's because grandpa is too close to..."
"00:02:10,969","00:02:13,530",...being one himself. Go back to bed.
"00:02:13,716","00:02:15,577",Were you dreaming about the crash?
"00:02:16,875","00:02:19,465",Get your butt back in bed Murph.
"00:02:45,531","00:02:48,068",The wheat had died.
"00:02:48,179","00:02:52,224",The blight came and we had to burn it. We still had corn.
"00:02:52,304","00:02:57,141",We had acres of corn. But mostly we had dust.
"00:02:59,680","00:03:02,317",I guess I can't describe it. It was just constant.
"00:03:02,428","00:03:06,801","Just that, steady blow of dirt."
"00:03:08,279","00:03:11,245",We wore little strips of sheet...
"00:03:11,362","00:03:16,312",...sometimes over our nose and mouth. So we wouldn't breathe so much of it.
"00:03:18,290","00:03:22,216",Well when we set the table we always set the plate upside down.
"00:03:22,367","00:03:24,938","Glasses or cups, whatever it was, upside down."
"00:03:30,482","00:03:34,570","Shake a leg. Murph, get your move on. -One o'clock today, you and me..."
"00:03:34,570","00:03:38,146","...in the barn, Herbicide Resistance 101, check? -Yessir."
"00:03:39,841","00:03:41,059",Not at the table Murph!
"00:03:42,081","00:03:43,761","Dad, can you fix this?"
"00:03:45,164","00:03:48,189",What the heck did you do to my lander? -It wasn't me.
"00:03:48,268","00:03:51,945",Let me guess. It was your ghost. -It knocked it off my shelf.
"00:03:52,019","00:03:54,753",It also knocks the books off. -There's no such thing as ghosts dumbass.
"00:03:54,866","00:03:57,030","Hey. -I looked it up, it's called a poltergeist."
"00:03:57,109","00:04:00,740","Dad, tell her. -Well, that's not very scientific Murph."
"00:04:00,853","00:04:04,637",You said that science was about admitting what we don't know. -She's got you there.
"00:04:04,750","00:04:06,841","Hey, start looking after all our stuff."
"00:04:08,500","00:04:09,580",Coop.
"00:04:11,852","00:04:14,373","Alright Murph, you wanna talk science?"
"00:04:14,913","00:04:18,846","Don't just tell me that you're afraid of some ghost. No, you gotta go further."
"00:04:18,959","00:04:21,079","You have to record the facts, analyze..."
"00:04:21,188","00:04:25,391",...get to the how and the why and present your conclusions. Deal?
"00:04:25,504","00:04:27,765",Deal. -All right!
"00:04:29,626","00:04:32,292",Have a good day at school. -Hold up.
"00:04:32,364","00:04:36,636","Parent-Teacher conferences, parent, not grandparent."
"00:04:39,510","00:04:43,625",Slow down turbo. That's not a dust storm.
"00:04:43,731","00:04:46,708",Nelson's torching his whole crop. -Blight?
"00:04:46,828","00:04:51,364",They're saying it's the last harvest for okra. Ever.
"00:04:53,249","00:04:58,147",He should have planted corn like the rest of us. -Now you be nice to that Miss Hanley.
"00:04:58,260","00:05:00,603",She's single. -Well what's that supposed to mean?
"00:05:00,713","00:05:03,977",Repopulating the Earth. -Start pulling your weight young man.
"00:05:04,053","00:05:08,176",Why don't you start minding your own business? Old man!
"00:05:15,284","00:05:16,767",All right Murph give me second.
"00:05:18,298","00:05:21,771","Aha,....thirrrd."
"00:05:22,781","00:05:26,707",Find a gear dumbass. -Grind it! -Shut it Tom!
"00:05:27,611","00:05:30,504","Whatcha do Murph? -Ahh, she didn't do nothing."
"00:05:30,587","00:05:34,172",Blew a tire is all. -Murphy's Law. -Shut up!
"00:05:34,253","00:05:37,076",Grab the spare Tom. -That is the spare.
"00:05:37,185","00:05:40,278",Get the patch kit.
"00:05:41,765","00:05:43,895",And how am I supposed to patch it out here?
"00:05:43,968","00:05:47,372",You'll have to figure it out. I'm not always gonna be here to help you.
"00:05:54,874","00:05:57,767",What's goin' on Murph?
"00:05:57,842","00:06:02,567",Why did you and mom name me after something that's bad? -No we didn't?
"00:06:02,641","00:06:04,473",Murphy's Law?
"00:06:05,847","00:06:08,721",Murphy's Law doesn't mean that something bad...
"00:06:08,831","00:06:11,637",...will happen. What it means is whatever can happen...
"00:06:11,638","00:06:15,346",...will happen. And that sounded just fine with us.
"00:06:21,293","00:06:23,131",Get in.
"00:06:24,612","00:06:25,838","Get in, let's go."
"00:06:27,216","00:06:29,701",What about the flat tire?
"00:06:32,347","00:06:33,223",Yes.
"00:06:47,437","00:06:52,208",It is an Indian Air Force drone. Solar cells could power an entire farm.
"00:06:52,320","00:06:53,221",Take the wheel Tom.
"00:06:58,482","00:07:01,366","Go, go go!"
"00:07:01,455","00:07:03,075",Keep it pointed at that.
"00:07:11,073","00:07:14,007","Faster Tom, we're losing it. -Yes."
"00:07:14,085","00:07:15,956",Point right at it.
"00:07:17,219","00:07:21,361","Hang on, here we go, here we go."
"00:07:29,433","00:07:31,405",Nice driving Tom.
"00:07:38,050","00:07:42,280","Dad? -Almost got it, don't stop, don't stop."
"00:07:42,389","00:07:45,332",Dad?! Tom!!!
"00:07:50,112","00:07:52,092",Wha..? You told me to keep driving.
"00:07:53,533","00:07:57,566",Well I guess that answers the ol' 'if I ask you to drive off a cliff' scenario.
"00:08:00,344","00:08:03,662",We lost it. -No we didn't!
"00:08:15,414","00:08:18,010",Wanna give it a whirl?
"00:08:24,455","00:08:25,391",
"00:07:41,735","00:07:42,971",
"00:07:43,871","00:07:47,400","Let's land it down there, right at the edge of the reservoir."
"00:08:40,465","00:08:42,082",Nicely done!
"00:08:44,200","00:08:46,975",How long do you think it's been up there?
"00:08:47,053","00:08:50,925","Delhi Mission Control went down same as ours, 10 years ago."
"00:08:52,299","00:08:53,701",So for 10 years?
"00:08:56,615","00:08:59,354",Why'd it come down so low? -I don't know.
"00:08:59,466","00:09:03,604",Maybe the sun cooked it's brain or it was looking for something. -What?
"00:09:03,717","00:09:07,150",Give me that large flatblade Maybe some kind of signal.
"00:09:07,259","00:09:08,441",I don't know.
"00:09:13,532","00:09:15,073",What are you gonna do with it?
"00:09:15,153","00:09:19,009",I'm gonna give it something socially responsible to do...
"00:09:19,044","00:09:23,574","...like driving a combine. -Can't we just, let it go?"
"00:09:25,151","00:09:27,027",It wasn't hurting anybody.
"00:09:29,079","00:09:33,172","Listen, this thing needs to learn how to adapt Murph, like the rest of us."
"00:09:37,351","00:09:40,989",So how's this work? Do you guys come with? -I've got class.
"00:09:41,067","00:09:43,554","This one, needs to wait."
"00:09:43,627","00:09:47,782",What did you do? -They'll tell you about it when you get in there.
"00:09:47,859","00:09:50,353",Well am I gonna be mad? -Not with me.
"00:09:50,462","00:09:51,756","Just please, try not to."
"00:09:51,872","00:09:55,766","Hey, relax....I got this."
"00:10:00,253","00:10:03,647","You're late Coop. -Yeah, we had a flat."
"00:10:03,717","00:10:07,684",And I guess you had to stop off at Asian fighter plane store.
"00:10:07,793","00:10:11,034","No actually sir, that's a, that's a surveillance drone."
"00:10:11,144","00:10:14,947",With outstanding solar cells. It's Indian. -Take a seat.
"00:10:16,535","00:10:21,241","So, we got Tom's scores back."
"00:10:21,352","00:10:26,074",He's gonna make an excellent farmer. -Yeah he's got a knack for it.
"00:10:26,183","00:10:27,448",What about college?
"00:10:27,566","00:10:31,808",Well the university only takes a handful. They don't really have the resources.
"00:10:31,880","00:10:36,800",-I still pay my taxes. Where does that money go? There's no more armies.
"00:10:36,911","00:10:38,802","Well, they don't go to the university."
"00:10:39,924","00:10:41,655","Look Coop, you have to be realistic."
"00:10:41,766","00:10:46,133",You're ruling my son out for college now? The kid's 15.
"00:10:46,279","00:10:50,788",Tom's score simply isn't high enough. -What's your waistline?
"00:10:50,860","00:10:55,650","How about 32, about 33 inseam? -I'm not sure I see where you're getting at."
"00:10:55,760","00:10:57,896",You're telling me it takes two numbers to measure your own ass...
"00:10:57,897","00:11:00,348",...but only one to measure my son's future?
"00:11:00,420","00:11:04,058","Come on, you're a well-educated man Coop..."
"00:11:04,170","00:11:06,407",...and a trained pilot. -And an engineer.
"00:11:06,442","00:11:11,264","Okay well right now, we don't need more engineers."
"00:11:11,298","00:11:16,341",We didn't run out of television screens or planes; we ran out of food!
"00:11:16,453","00:11:20,813","The world needs farmers. Good farmers like you, and Tom."
"00:11:21,004","00:11:25,652",Uneducated farmers. -We are a caretaker generation Coop.
"00:11:25,771","00:11:29,473",And things are getting better. Maybe your grandkids will get to be...
"00:11:29,474","00:11:30,196",-Are we done here sir?
"00:11:31,465","00:11:35,678",No. Miss Hanley is here to talk about Murph.
"00:11:35,754","00:11:40,655","Murph is a great kid, she's really bright. But she's been having a little trouble lately."
"00:11:40,728","00:11:45,100",She brought this in to show the other students. The section on the lunar landings.
"00:11:45,176","00:11:49,631","Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks. She always loved the pictures."
"00:11:49,715","00:11:53,633",It's an old federal textbook. We've replaced them with the corrected versions.
"00:11:53,710","00:11:58,477",Corrected? -Explaining how the Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt...
"00:11:58,512","00:11:59,669",...the Soviet Union.
"00:12:05,030","00:12:08,187",You don't believe we went to the Moon?
"00:12:08,298","00:12:12,693",I believe it was a brilliant piece of propaganda that the Soviets bankrupted themselves...
"00:12:12,728","00:12:16,328",...pouring resources into rockets and other useless machines.
"00:12:16,436","00:12:17,876",Useless machines?
"00:12:17,985","00:12:21,864",And if we don't want a repeat of the excess and wastefulness of the 20th century...
"00:12:21,899","00:12:25,721",...then we need to teach our kids about this planet. Not tales of leaving it.
"00:12:25,830","00:12:30,421",Y'know one of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI.
"00:12:30,531","00:12:34,033","And if we had any of those left, the doctors would've been able to find..."
"00:12:34,108","00:12:38,064",...the cyst in my wife's brain before she died; instead of afterwards.
"00:12:38,136","00:12:41,837",And then she would have been the one sitting here listening to this instead of me...
"00:12:41,917","00:12:46,604",...which would've been a good thing because she was always the... the calmer one.
"00:12:46,868","00:12:49,851",I'm sorry about your wife Mr. Cooper.
"00:12:50,039","00:12:54,404",But Murph got into a fistfight with several of her classmates...
"00:12:54,405","00:12:56,809",...over this Apollo nonsense.
"00:12:56,844","00:12:59,955",So we thought it would be best to bring you in and see what ideas you might have...
"00:12:59,990","00:13:02,765",...for dealing with her behaviour on the home front.
"00:13:02,872","00:13:06,536","Yeah, you know what, there's a game tomorrow night."
"00:13:06,691","00:13:10,419","She's going through a bit of a baseball phase, her favorite team is playing."
"00:13:10,532","00:13:12,089",There's gonna be candy and soda...
"00:13:14,995","00:13:17,976",...I think I'll take her to that.
"00:13:22,182","00:13:26,980",How'd it go? -I got you suspended.
"00:13:27,090","00:13:29,247",What?? -Cooper.
"00:13:30,323","00:13:34,925","This is Cooper, go. -Coop, those combines you rebuilt went haywire."
"00:13:35,004","00:13:39,651","Just reset the controllers. -I did that, but you should come take a look."
"00:13:59,978","00:14:02,758",One by one they just teared off the fields and headed over.
"00:14:02,870","00:14:05,573",something's interfering with the compass.
"00:14:05,687","00:14:09,134",Magnetism. Or somethin' such.
"00:14:51,789","00:14:56,003","There's nothing special about which book. I've been working on it, like you said."
"00:14:56,073","00:14:59,344",I counted the spaces. -Why?
"00:15:00,897","00:15:05,834",In case the ghost is trying to communicate. I'm trying Morse.
"00:15:05,911","00:15:10,624","Morse? -Yeah, dots and dashes. It's..."
"00:15:10,696","00:15:13,020",I know what Morse code is Murph. But I still don't think your...
"00:15:13,034","00:15:15,222",...bookshelf is trying to talk to you.
"00:15:26,678","00:15:31,104",Had to reset every compass clock and GPS to offset off the anomaly.
"00:15:31,257","00:15:34,015",Which is? -I don't know.
"00:15:35,632","00:15:37,850",Now if the house had been built on magnetic ore...
"00:15:37,923","00:15:40,730",...we would have seen this the first time we switched on the tractor.
"00:15:42,866","00:15:46,694",I hear your meeting at the school didn't go so well.
"00:15:48,211","00:15:53,182","You heard? It's like we've forgotten who we are, Donald."
"00:15:55,055","00:15:58,145","Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers."
"00:16:00,745","00:16:04,882","When I was a kid, it felt like they made something new everyday."
"00:16:04,994","00:16:08,121",Some gadget or idea.
"00:16:08,231","00:16:12,875","Like every day was Christmas. But 6, billion people,"
"00:16:12,946","00:16:14,864",Just try to imagine that.
"00:16:15,432","00:16:19,219",And every last one of them trying to have it all.
"00:16:21,810","00:16:24,178",This world isn't so bad.
"00:16:27,246","00:16:30,548",And Tom will do just fine. You're the one who doesn't belong.
"00:16:30,623","00:16:33,318",Born 40 years too late or 40 years too early.
"00:16:34,254","00:16:36,779",My daughter knew it. God bless her.
"00:16:38,112","00:16:40,664","And your kids know it, especially Murph."
"00:16:40,773","00:16:44,086",Ahh we used to look up to the sky and wonder...
"00:16:44,895","00:16:47,483",...at our place in the stars.
"00:16:49,831","00:16:51,774","Now we just look down,"
"00:16:51,883","00:16:54,847",and worry about our place in the dirt.
"00:16:54,955","00:16:57,397","Cooper, you were good at something,"
"00:16:57,475","00:17:01,071",and you never got a chance to do anything with it.
"00:17:01,180","00:17:02,906",I'm sorry.
"00:17:04,351","00:17:08,320",You didn't expect this dirt that was giving you this food...
"00:17:08,402","00:17:12,222",...to turn on you like that and destroy you.
"00:17:12,302","00:17:17,212","In April I believe if I'm right, 15th of April I, I think."
"00:17:17,247","00:17:21,671",This just happened at about 1:30 when that thing came off the top of the canyon.
"00:17:21,746","00:17:27,025",In my day we had real ball players. Who're these bums?
"00:17:27,135","00:17:29,835","Well in my day, people were too busy..."
"00:17:29,921","00:17:32,247",...fighting over food to even play baseball.
"00:17:32,282","00:17:37,149",Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural. I want a hot dog.
"00:17:37,224","00:17:39,567",School says you're gonna follow in my footsteps.
"00:17:40,615","00:17:43,679",I think that's great. You think that's great?
"00:17:43,792","00:17:47,570",You hate farming dad. Grandpa said.
"00:17:47,678","00:17:52,320","Grandpa said huh? Listen, all that matters is how you feel about it."
"00:17:52,465","00:17:56,573",I like what you do. I like our farm.
"00:17:56,723","00:17:58,706",And you're gonna be great at it.
"00:18:11,585","00:18:13,134",Let's get outta here.
"00:18:20,961","00:18:25,138","All right it's a doozy. Alright gang, lets mask up."
"00:18:28,489","00:18:30,255","Tom, Murph? -Check. -Check?"
"00:19:23,986","00:19:26,198","Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?"
"00:19:30,208","00:19:31,543",Murph.
"00:19:52,269","00:19:57,117",The ghost. -Grab your pillow.
"00:19:57,226","00:19:59,570",You're sleeping with Tom.
"00:20:54,218","00:20:56,336",It's not a ghost.
"00:21:01,656","00:21:02,990",It's gravity.
"00:21:04,907","00:21:07,483","I'm dropping Tom, then heading into town."
"00:21:07,596","00:21:11,917",You wanna clean that up? When you've finished praying to it.
"00:21:37,327","00:21:39,917","It's not Morse Murph, it's binary."
"00:21:40,029","00:21:42,441","Thick is 1, thin is 0."
"00:21:46,185","00:21:47,734",Coordinates.
"00:22:01,028","00:22:05,911",That's it. -I can't miss this.
"00:22:06,025","00:22:08,572",Grandpa will be back in a couple of hours Murph.
"00:22:09,664","00:22:11,627",But you don't know what you're gonna find.
"00:22:12,542","00:22:17,542","And that, is why I can't take you."
"00:22:23,382","00:22:24,671",Murph?
"00:22:25,798","00:22:30,081","Grandpa will be home in a while, tell him I'll call him on the radio."
"00:22:37,236","00:22:40,195",Jesus! What're you doing?
"00:22:40,305","00:22:42,909",Oh d'you think it's funny? Huh?
"00:22:42,983","00:22:45,814",You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.
"00:22:47,794","00:22:50,231",Make yourself useful.
"00:23:53,203","00:23:54,253",Hey Murph.
"00:23:55,300","00:23:56,952",Murph.
"00:24:00,628","00:24:02,857",I think this is the end of the road.
"00:24:05,264","00:24:07,357",Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?
"00:24:09,234","00:24:10,604",That's my girl.
"00:24:37,200","00:24:41,617","Step away from the fence. -Don't shoot, don't shoot. I'm unarmed."
"00:24:41,724","00:24:42,981",My daughter is in the car.
"00:24:47,631","00:24:50,223",Don't be afraid.
"00:25:02,938","00:25:07,150",How did you find this place? -Where is my daughter?
"00:25:07,264","00:25:11,518",You had the coordinates for this facility marked on your map. Where did you get those coordinates?
"00:25:11,876","00:25:15,378","Where is my daughter?! -Don't make me take you down again, sit down!"
"00:25:15,486","00:25:18,434",Oh d'you still think you're a Marine pal?
"00:25:18,545","00:25:20,848",Marines don't exist. And you know what?
"00:25:20,956","00:25:24,662",I've got grunts like you mowing my grass.
"00:25:24,736","00:25:28,848",Where did you find those coordinates? -Unless you wanna end up as my second lawnmower...
"00:25:29,498","00:25:33,721","...no, I think I'll turn you into a valve of a vacuum or a dry cleaner. No you won't."
"00:25:35,101","00:25:37,686","TARS, back down please."
"00:25:38,947","00:25:42,018",You're taking a risk using ex-military security.
"00:25:42,136","00:25:46,202",They are old and their control units are unpredictable.
"00:25:46,315","00:25:48,219",It's what the government could spare.
"00:25:49,776","00:25:52,815",Who are you? -Dr. Brand.
"00:25:52,926","00:25:57,785","Yeah I knew a Dr. Brand once, he was a Professor. -What makes you think I'm not?"
"00:25:57,894","00:25:59,494",Wasn't near as cute either.
"00:25:59,609","00:26:03,350","Please Dr. Brand, I don't have any idea what this is."
"00:26:03,463","00:26:06,629","But I'm scared for my daughter, and I want her by my side."
"00:26:06,705","00:26:09,228","You give me that, and I'll tell you anything you want to know."
"00:26:12,260","00:26:14,797",Take the principal and the girl to the conference room.
"00:26:15,989","00:26:19,849",Your daughter is fine. Bright kid.
"00:26:19,927","00:26:24,461",Must have a very smart mother. -It's pretty clear you don't want any visitors.
"00:26:24,573","00:26:28,878","Why don't you let us back up from your fence and we'll be on our way, huh?"
"00:26:29,021","00:26:31,801","It's not that simple. -Well, sure it is."
"00:26:31,913","00:26:34,899",Look I don't know anything about you. I don't know anything about this place.
"00:26:35,008","00:26:37,239",Yes you do.
"00:26:42,097","00:26:44,003",Dad!
"00:26:46,934","00:26:48,230",Hello Cooper.
"00:26:49,492","00:26:50,718",Professor Brand.
"00:26:52,056","00:26:54,684",Explain to me how you found this facility.
"00:26:54,762","00:26:58,220",Kind of accidently stumbled upon it. We were on a salvage run...
"00:26:58,331","00:27:00,851",You're sitting in the best kept secret in the world.
"00:27:00,922","00:27:03,757","Nobody stumbles in here, nobody stumbles out."
"00:27:04,639","00:27:08,698","Cooper, please, cooperate with these people."
"00:27:08,843","00:27:13,013","Well, it's kinda hard to explain."
"00:27:13,087","00:27:17,122","We we.., we learnt these coordinates..."
"00:27:17,123","00:27:19,763",...from an anomaly. -What sort of anomaly?
"00:27:19,874","00:27:23,699",I hesitate to term it supernatural but it damn well wasn't scientific...
"00:27:23,812","00:27:28,650","You're gonna have to be specific Mr. Cooper, right now. -It was gravity."
"00:27:33,605","00:27:36,412",Um what sort of gravitational an- where was this thing?
"00:27:36,492","00:27:39,908","Hey, I'm real happy that you're excited about gravity bud, but..."
"00:27:39,909","00:27:44,478",...you're not getting any answers from us until I get assurances. -Assurances? -Yeah.
"00:27:45,530","00:27:49,510","Like that we're getting out of here, and I don't mean in the trunk of some car."
"00:27:50,867","00:27:55,349","Don't you know who we are Coop? -No Professor, I don't."
"00:27:55,457","00:27:59,059",You know my father Professor Brand. We're NASA.
"00:28:00,584","00:28:03,079",NASA. -NASA.
"00:28:03,222","00:28:05,744","The same NASA, you flew for."
"00:28:15,134","00:28:19,530","I heard they shut you down sir, for refusing to drop bombs from..."
"00:28:19,611","00:28:22,048",...the stratosphere on the starving people.
"00:28:22,266","00:28:24,764",When they realized that killing other people...
"00:28:24,765","00:28:29,299","...was not a long term solution, then they needed us back. In secret."
"00:28:29,411","00:28:33,930",Why secret? -Because public opinion wouldn't allow spending on space exploration.
"00:28:34,007","00:28:36,765",Not when you're struggling to put food on the table.
"00:28:36,874","00:28:42,159","Blight. Wheat, seven years ago."
"00:28:42,272","00:28:45,434","Okra, this year. -Now, there's just corn."
"00:28:45,547","00:28:48,145",And we're growing more than we ever had.
"00:28:48,256","00:28:52,605","Yeah, but like the potatoes in Ireland and the wheat in the dust bowl..."
"00:28:52,714","00:28:57,397",...the corn will die. Soon.
"00:29:02,475","00:29:06,262","We'll find a way, Professor, we always have."
"00:29:06,376","00:29:11,164",Driven by the unshakeable faith that the Earth is ours?
"00:29:11,279","00:29:13,296","Well not just ours, no."
"00:29:14,564","00:29:15,824",But it is our home.
"00:29:15,935","00:29:20,475",Earth's atmosphere is 80% nitrogen.
"00:29:20,584","00:29:22,515",We don't even breathe nitrogen.
"00:29:22,660","00:29:27,241","Blight does, and as it thrives, our air gets less and less oxygen."
"00:29:27,349","00:29:31,178","The last people to starve, will be the first to suffocate."
"00:29:31,293","00:29:33,577",And your daughter's generation...
"00:29:34,476","00:29:37,347",...will be the last to survive on Earth.
"00:29:37,459","00:29:41,421","Murph is feeling a little tired, and was wondering if she could take a nap in my office?"
"00:29:41,531","00:29:42,952","Yeah, thank you."
"00:29:45,885","00:29:47,003",Okay.
"00:29:47,147","00:29:51,211","Now you need to tell me, what your plan is to save the world?"
"00:29:52,548","00:29:56,169",We're not meant to save the world. We're meant to leave it.
"00:30:01,613","00:30:06,194",Rangers. -The last components of our one versatile ship in orbit.
"00:30:06,274","00:30:10,105",The Endurance. Our final expedition.
"00:30:10,214","00:30:14,183",You sent people out there looking for a new home?
"00:30:14,291","00:30:17,185",The Lazarus missions. -Sounds cheerful!
"00:30:17,292","00:30:21,552","Lazarus came back from the dead. -Sure, but he had to die in the first place."
"00:30:21,662","00:30:24,087",There's not a planet in our solar system that could sustain...
"00:30:24,088","00:30:27,569",...life and the nearest star is over a 1000 years away.
"00:30:27,604","00:30:29,703","I mean, it doesn't even qualify as futile."
"00:30:31,010","00:30:33,135",Where did you send them?
"00:30:33,206","00:30:39,004","Cooper, I can't tell you any more unless you agree to pilot this craft."
"00:30:39,120","00:30:43,514",You're the best pilot we ever had. -I barely left the stratosphere.
"00:30:43,622","00:30:45,925",This team never left the simulator!
"00:30:45,998","00:30:49,460","We need a pilot, and this is the mission that you were trained for."
"00:30:49,566","00:30:51,544","What, without even knowing?"
"00:30:51,690","00:30:56,649","An hour ago, you didn't even know I was alive, and you were going anyway."
"00:30:56,831","00:31:00,785",We had no choice. But something sent you here.
"00:31:00,930","00:31:03,393",They chose you. -Who's 'They'?
"00:31:11,142","00:31:15,213","How long, would I be gone? -Hard to know."
"00:31:15,325","00:31:19,232",Years. -I've got kids Professor.
"00:31:19,343","00:31:22,505","Get out there, and save them."
"00:31:25,455","00:31:29,190","Who's 'They'? -We started detecting gravitational anomalies,"
"00:31:29,309","00:31:31,044",almost 50 years ago.
"00:31:31,079","00:31:34,727",Mostly small distortions to our instruments in the upper atmosphere.
"00:31:34,840","00:31:38,004",In fact I believe you encountered one yourself.
"00:31:38,116","00:31:40,411","Yeah, in the Straits."
"00:31:40,524","00:31:44,694","My crash, something tripped my fly-by-wire."
"00:31:44,770","00:31:51,628","Exactly. But of all these anomalies, the most significant is this."
"00:31:51,774","00:31:55,692",Out near Saturn. A disturbance of spacetime.
"00:31:57,252","00:32:01,389",Is that a wormhole? -It appeared 48 years ago.
"00:32:01,539","00:32:05,597","And it leads, where? -Another galaxy."
"00:32:06,967","00:32:10,060",A wormhole is not a naturally occuring phenomenon.
"00:32:10,167","00:32:12,702",Someone placed it there. -'They'?
"00:32:13,962","00:32:17,934","And whoever they are, they appear to be looking out for us."
"00:32:18,043","00:32:21,179",That wormhole let's us travel to other stars.
"00:32:21,298","00:32:23,452",It came right around when we needed it.
"00:32:23,547","00:32:26,688",They've put potentially habitable worlds right within our reach.
"00:32:26,832","00:32:30,701","Twelve, in fact from our initial probes. -You sent probes into that?"
"00:32:30,847","00:32:34,381","We sent people into it, 10 years ago."
"00:32:34,494","00:32:37,044",The Lazarus missions.
"00:32:37,550","00:32:40,784","12 possible worlds, 12 Ranger launches."
"00:32:40,785","00:32:44,129",Carrying the bravest humans ever to live.
"00:32:44,307","00:32:47,084",Led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.
"00:32:47,360","00:32:50,361",Each person's landing pod had enough life support for two years.
"00:32:50,428","00:32:52,015",But they could use hibernation to stretch that...
"00:32:52,124","00:32:56,120",...making observations on organics over a decade or more.
"00:32:56,270","00:32:58,529",Their mission was to assess their world and...
"00:32:58,606","00:33:02,310","...if it showed potential, then they could send out a signal and bed down for the long nap..."
"00:33:02,419","00:33:06,743",...wait to be rescued. -And what if the world didn't show promise?
"00:33:07,135","00:33:08,789",Hence the bravery.
"00:33:08,898","00:33:13,120",You don't have the resources to visit all 12. -No.
"00:33:14,699","00:33:17,039",Data transmission back through the wormhole is rudimentary.
"00:33:17,148","00:33:20,030",Simple binary pings on an annual basis...
"00:33:20,126","00:33:24,823",...give us some clue as to which worlds have potential. One system shows promise.
"00:33:24,895","00:33:27,192","Well one, that's a bit of a long shot isn't it?"
"00:33:27,621","00:33:30,796",One system with 3 potential worlds?
"00:33:30,908","00:33:32,695",Not a long shot.
"00:33:35,109","00:33:38,924",Wait. So if we find a home...
"00:33:42,606","00:33:45,889",...then what? -That's the long shot.
"00:33:46,047","00:33:49,246","There is a plan A, and a plan B."
"00:33:49,358","00:33:53,278",Did you notice anything strange about the launch chamber?
"00:34:03,690","00:34:07,465",This entire facility is a centrifuge.
"00:34:07,612","00:34:12,591",Some kind of vehicle? A space station? -Both. The plan A.
"00:34:12,706","00:34:14,214",How do you get it off the ground?
"00:34:14,397","00:34:18,637",The first gravitational anomalies changed everything.
"00:34:18,784","00:34:23,173",Suddenly we knew that harnessing gravity was real.
"00:34:23,319","00:34:27,196",So I started working on a theory and we started...
"00:34:27,267","00:34:30,510",...building this station. -But you haven't solved it yet.
"00:34:30,656","00:34:33,350",That's why there's a plan B.
"00:34:33,534","00:34:35,700",The problem is gravity.
"00:34:35,847","00:34:38,689",How to get a viable amount of human life off the planet?
"00:34:38,876","00:34:42,871",This is one way. The plan B. Population bomb.
"00:34:42,982","00:34:47,217",Over 5000 fertilized eggs weighing in at just under 900 kilos.
"00:34:48,701","00:34:52,834",How would you raise 'em? -With the equipment onboard we incubate the first ten.
"00:34:52,995","00:34:56,615","After that, with surrogacy the growth becomes exponential."
"00:34:56,761","00:35:00,789","In 30 years, we could have a colony of hundreds."
"00:35:00,902","00:35:04,983",The real difficulty with colonization is genetic diversity.
"00:35:05,018","00:35:06,154",This will take care of that.
"00:35:06,335","00:35:11,047","Yeah, but what about the people here? You just, you'd give up on 'em?"
"00:35:11,191","00:35:16,165",My kids? -That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.
"00:35:18,191","00:35:21,747",How far have you got? -Almost there.
"00:35:21,890","00:35:24,768",You're asking me to hang everything...
"00:35:24,920","00:35:29,387",...on an 'almost'. -I'm asking you to trust me.
"00:35:31,978","00:35:34,497",Find us a new home.
"00:35:34,645","00:35:39,096","And by the time you return, I would've solved the problem..."
"00:35:39,422","00:35:42,650",...of gravity. I give you my word.
"00:35:55,320","00:35:56,621",Go away!
"00:36:07,494","00:36:11,697",Murph. -Go. If you're leaving just go!
"00:36:14,188","00:36:18,352","This world was never enough for you, was it Cooper?"
"00:36:18,437","00:36:22,892","What, cause heading out there is what I feel like... ...I was born to do?"
"00:36:22,980","00:36:24,883",And it excites me?
"00:36:25,031","00:36:29,352","Nah, it does not make it wrong. -It might."
"00:36:29,502","00:36:33,295",Don't trust the right thing done for the wrong reason.
"00:36:33,744","00:36:38,324","The 'why' of the thing, that's the foundation. -And the foundation's solid."
"00:36:40,659","00:36:44,208","We farmers, we sit here every year when..."
"00:36:44,243","00:36:48,171","...the rains fail, and we say: Next year."
"00:36:48,318","00:36:52,380","Well, next year ain't gonna save us, nor the one after that."
"00:36:52,490","00:36:57,198","This world's a treasure Donald, but it's been telling us to leave for a while now."
"00:37:01,591","00:37:05,721","Mankind was born on Earth, it was never meant to die here."
"00:37:08,866","00:37:13,387","Tom will be alright, but you got to make things right with Murph. -I will."
"00:37:13,702","00:37:17,442",Without making promises you don't know you can keep.
"00:37:26,975","00:37:29,889",You have to talk to me Murph.
"00:37:31,397","00:37:34,779",I need to fix this before I go.
"00:37:34,936","00:37:37,408",Then I'll keep it broken so you'll have to stay.
"00:37:38,641","00:37:44,513","After you kids came along, your mom, she said something to me I never quite understood."
"00:37:44,662","00:37:49,407","She said: Now, we're just here..."
"00:37:50,232","00:37:52,572",...to be the memories for our kids.
"00:37:57,214","00:38:00,170",I think I now understand what she meant.
"00:38:02,980","00:38:07,794","Once you're a parent, you're the ghost of your children's future."
"00:38:08,886","00:38:11,700",You said ghosts didn't exist.
"00:38:17,743","00:38:19,469",That's right Murph.
"00:38:22,025","00:38:24,469",Look at me.
"00:38:26,947","00:38:29,486",I can't be your ghost right now.
"00:38:31,213","00:38:33,223",I need to exist.
"00:38:34,485","00:38:37,249",They chose me.
"00:38:37,440","00:38:41,282","Murph, they chose me. You saw it. You're the one who led me to 'em."
"00:38:43,400","00:38:46,779",And that's exactly why you can't go!
"00:38:49,842","00:38:54,819",I figured out the message. One word. You know what it is?
"00:38:54,929","00:38:57,530",Murph. -STAY.
"00:38:57,680","00:39:00,954",It says STAY dad. -Murph.
"00:39:01,067","00:39:05,868",You don't believe me! Look at the books. Look it says STAY.
"00:39:05,986","00:39:10,380",Why are you not listening? IT SAYS STAY! -I'm coming back.
"00:39:10,489","00:39:12,610",When??
"00:39:24,692","00:39:28,480",One for you. One for me.
"00:39:28,586","00:39:30,493","When I'm up there in hypersleep,"
"00:39:30,687","00:39:34,216","or, or traveling at the speed of light,"
"00:39:34,403","00:39:36,856","or, near a black hole,"
"00:39:37,000","00:39:40,306",Time is gonna change for me.
"00:39:40,451","00:39:42,620",And it's gonna run more slowly.
"00:39:42,757","00:39:45,742","So, when we get back,"
"00:39:45,927","00:39:50,575",we're gonna compare. -Time will run differently for us?
"00:39:50,688","00:39:51,518",Yeah.
"00:39:51,631","00:39:55,769","Maybe by the time I get back, you and I, we might be the same age."
"00:39:55,918","00:39:58,436",You and me. What??
"00:39:58,585","00:40:00,024",Imagine that!
"00:40:03,661","00:40:07,731","Ah, Murph. -You've no idea when you're coming back!!"
"00:40:09,217","00:40:13,003",No idea at all! -Murph.
"00:40:14,297","00:40:18,324","Murph, don't ma-, don't make me leave like this. Murph!"
"00:40:18,506","00:40:21,100",Don't make me leave like this Murph!!
"00:40:27,180","00:40:31,882","Hey,...I love you."
"00:40:32,065","00:40:35,895",You hear me? I love you forever.
"00:40:36,040","00:40:37,407",And I'm coming back.
"00:40:43,423","00:40:44,905",I'm coming back.
"00:41:02,627","00:41:05,370",How did it go? -Fine.
"00:41:05,485","00:41:06,921",Just fine.
"00:41:14,839","00:41:19,779","I love you Tom. -Travel safe, okay? -Yeah. Take care of our place for me alright?"
"00:41:19,892","00:41:23,146",Huh? -Uh huh.
"00:41:26,138","00:41:29,527","Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone? -You mean your truck?"
"00:41:31,113","00:41:33,090",I'll make sure they bring it back.
"00:41:34,320","00:41:36,661",Look after my kids Donald.
"00:41:49,617","00:41:53,282",Go for main engines. Start T minus 10.
"00:41:53,744","00:41:57,993",Dad! -9 -Dad!!
"00:41:58,028","00:42:02,467","8, 7. -DAD!!!"

"00:42:49,670","00:42:53,768","They gave him a humor setting, to fit in better with his unit."
"00:42:53,769","00:42:58,460",He thinks it relaxes us. -A giant sarcastic robot!
"00:42:59,798","00:43:03,791","What a great idea! -I have a cue light I could use when I'm joking, if you'd like?"
"00:43:03,826","00:43:05,025","That wouldn't be a problem, no."
"00:43:05,135","00:43:09,230",Yeah you could use it to find your way back into the ship after I blow you out the air lock.
"00:43:09,381","00:43:12,270",What's your humor setting TARS?
"00:43:12,350","00:43:15,276",100% -Let's bring it down to 75 please.

"00:44:16,043","00:44:19,601",-We should learn to talk. -And when not to.
"00:44:20,655","00:44:25,478",Just being honest. -Well you don't need to be that honest.
"00:44:25,585","00:44:30,010","Hey TARS, what's your honesty parameter? -90%"
"00:44:30,155","00:44:31,633",90%?
"00:44:31,745","00:44:35,273",Absolute honesty isn't always the most diplomatic...
"00:44:35,391","00:44:39,022",...nor the safest form of communication with emotional beings. -Okay!
"00:44:39,132","00:44:41,478",90% it is Dr. Brand.

"00:48:51,254","00:48:52,126","Yeah, no I just need a minute."
"00:48:53,030","00:48:56,307","Okay, I think we have some dramamine in the hibe pad, I'm just gonna go get that."
"00:48:56,419","00:48:59,690",It'll be in the cryo beds Just be a sec. -Hey Brand?
"00:48:59,809","00:49:01,321",Yeah? -Bring a lot.
"00:49:09,771","00:49:13,439","Amelia, be safe."
"00:49:13,592","00:49:17,720",Give my regards to Dr. Mann. -I will Dad.
"00:49:17,831","00:49:22,791","It looks good for your trajectory. We've calculated, two years to Saturn."
"00:49:22,906","00:49:24,711",That's a lot of Dramamine.
"00:49:25,865","00:49:27,880","Look after my family will you please, sir?"
"00:49:28,023","00:49:31,260","We'll be waiting for you, when you get back."

"00:50:37,896","00:50:42,028",So alone. -We have each other. Dr. Mann had it worse.
"00:50:42,137","00:50:43,436",I mean them.
"00:50:46,130","00:50:49,050",It's a perfect planet and we're not gonna find another one like it.
"00:50:49,228","00:50:53,579","No, it's not like, looking for a new condo."

"00:51:01,911","00:51:03,569","We need to find that rock,"
"00:51:04,470","00:51:08,698",and our 3 prospects are at the edge of what might sustain human life.

"00:51:37,402","00:51:40,330",...seeing another human being again. I'm hoping we can surprise at least 3 of them.
"00:51:40,480","00:51:44,741","Dr. Mann? -Dr. Mann, well, he's remarkable.  He's the best of us."
"00:51:44,921","00:51:47,804",He inspired 11 people to follow him on the loneliest journey...

"00:52:02,373","00:52:07,193","No. Formidable, frightening. But, no, not evil."
"00:52:08,608","00:52:12,495",Is a lion evil because it rips a gazelle to shreds?
"00:52:12,647","00:52:14,481",Just what we take with us then?
"00:52:15,318","00:52:19,349",Yeah. This crew represents the best of humanity.
"00:52:19,495","00:52:22,532","Even me, huh? -Y'know what? We agreed, 90%."
"00:52:22,675","00:52:24,842",Don't stay up.
"00:52:24,949","00:52:26,114",I'll be in a minute.

"00:52:36,833","00:52:39,962","Hey TARS, let's go over that trajectory one more time."
"00:52:40,970","00:52:44,886","8 months to Mars. Gravity powered slingshot around,"
"00:52:45,000","00:52:47,345",14 months to Saturn. Nothing has changed on that.
"00:52:47,493","00:52:48,970",Let me ask you something.
"00:52:51,454","00:52:54,692",Dr. Brand and Edmunds. -Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.
"00:52:56,568","00:53:01,540","Dr. Brand and Edmunds, they close? -I wouldn't know."
"00:53:01,728","00:53:04,613",Is that '90% wouldn't know' or '10% wouldn't know'?
"00:53:04,760","00:53:06,812",I also have a discretion setting Cooper.
"00:53:08,470","00:53:12,177",But not a poker-face slick.
"00:53:23,663","00:53:24,961",Hey guys.
"00:53:25,108","00:53:28,782",Dad's about to go down for the long nap.
"00:53:28,928","00:53:31,732","and I just, wanted to give you an update."
"00:53:31,885","00:53:35,745",The Earth looks amazing from here.
"00:53:35,896","00:53:40,035",You can't see any of the dust.
"00:53:41,012","00:53:44,432","I really hope you guys are doin', doin' great."
"00:53:44,579","00:53:47,325","I know you're gonna get this message,"
"00:53:47,435","00:53:51,855","Professor Brand assured me that he was gonna get it to you. Alright, okay I love you!"
"00:53:53,336","00:53:55,468",Is it him? -I don't think so Murph.
"00:54:02,058","00:54:04,432",You must be Donald.
"00:54:05,728","00:54:10,314",Hello Murph. -Why are you in my dad's truck?
"00:54:10,465","00:54:13,127",He wanted me to bring it for your brother.
"00:54:13,275","00:54:15,903",He sent you a message.
"00:54:19,335","00:54:21,275",She's pretty upset with him for leaving.
"00:54:21,421","00:54:24,802",If you record any messages I can get them transmitted to Cooper.
"00:54:26,244","00:54:33,303","Murph is a bright spark. Maybe, I should fan the flame."
"00:54:33,338","00:54:37,979","She's already making fools of her teachers, well, maybe she should come and make a fool out of you."
"00:54:39,275","00:54:42,513",So where are they? -Heading for Mars.
"00:54:42,625","00:54:47,014","The next time you hear from Cooper, they'll be coming up on Saturn."
"00:55:26,315","00:55:30,376",They want me to repeat plant pathology.
"00:55:30,523","00:55:35,958","It sucks. But, they said I could start advanced agriculture a year early."
"00:55:36,424","00:55:39,883","So...alright. Well, I gotta go Dad."
"00:55:40,070","00:55:41,145",Hope you're safe up there.
"00:55:44,333","00:55:49,005","Sorry Coop, I asked Murph to say hi."
"00:55:49,079","00:55:54,016",But she's as stubborn as her old man. I'll try again next time.
"00:56:09,278","00:56:10,682",Are you okay Rom?
"00:56:11,910","00:56:16,603","This gets to me Cooper. This, this."
"00:56:16,744","00:56:20,200",Millimeters of aluminum protecting us and then nothing...
"00:56:20,346","00:56:24,054","...out there for millions of miles, won't kill us in seconds."
"00:56:25,134","00:56:30,048",Did you know that some of the finest solo yatchsmen in the world...
"00:56:30,083","00:56:34,741","...don't know how to swim? They don't know, and if they go overboard, it's done."
"00:56:36,338","00:56:38,578",We are explorers Rom.
"00:56:39,918","00:56:43,132",This is our boat. Here.
"00:57:10,163","00:57:14,937","This is the, relay probe? -In orbit around the wormhole."
"00:57:15,051","00:57:17,566",This is the wormhole and every time we come around...
"00:57:17,711","00:57:21,416",...we would receive images from the other side of the foreign galaxy.
"00:57:21,527","00:57:25,015",Like swinging a periscope around. -Exactly.
"00:57:25,129","00:57:29,030","So we got a pretty good idea, what we're gonna find on the other side, huh?"
"00:57:30,329","00:57:31,982",Navigationally.
"00:57:33,104","00:57:36,705","Hey guys, looks like we're gonna be approaching the wormhole in about three hours."
"00:57:43,586","00:57:46,721","Hey Coop, can we stop the spinning?"
"00:57:46,835","00:57:50,790",Why? -Because we are close enough to see it.
"00:57:52,304","00:57:54,971",Aha.
"00:57:59,191","00:58:03,403","Look, that's, that's it! That's the wormhole!"
"00:58:03,546","00:58:06,473","Say it, don't spray it Rom. It's a sphere."
"00:58:06,619","00:58:10,176",Well of course it is! What you thought it would just be a hole?
"00:58:11,226","00:58:15,107",No. It's just that all the illustrations I've ever seen they...
"00:58:15,272","00:58:19,117","The illustrations, try to show how it works."
"00:58:19,235","00:58:23,439","So they say you want to go from here, to there."
"00:58:23,593","00:58:25,078",But this is too far.
"00:58:25,261","00:58:28,884",So a wormhole bends space like this so you...
"00:58:28,919","00:58:32,507",...can take a shortcut through a higher dimension.
"00:58:32,618","00:58:37,412","Okay so, to show that they've turned 3-dimensional space..."
"00:58:37,488","00:58:41,785","...into 2 dimensions, which turns a wormhole in 2 dimensions..."
"00:58:41,804","00:58:44,952",...a circle. What's a circle in 3 dimensions?
"00:58:46,147","00:58:49,314",A sphere. -Exactly. A spherical hole.
"00:58:49,859","00:58:53,439",But who put it there? Who do we have to thank?
"00:58:53,660","00:58:58,374",I'm not thanking anybody until we get outta here in one piece Rom.
"00:59:03,694","00:59:06,791",Any trick to this Doyle?
"00:59:08,168","00:59:09,530",No one knows.
"00:59:15,971","00:59:18,814","The others made it, right?"
"00:59:20,584","00:59:22,638",At least some of 'em.
"00:59:53,359","00:59:57,491",Everybody ready to say goodbye to our solar system?
"00:59:57,638","01:00:00,223",To our galaxy.
"01:00:01,779","01:00:03,478",Here we go.
"01:00:35,695","01:00:39,152",Controls won't work here. We are passing through the bulk.
"01:00:39,264","01:00:44,090",Its space beyond our 3 dimensions. All you can do is report and observe.
"01:00:54,008","01:00:56,532",What is that?
"01:00:57,806","01:01:02,597",I think it's 'Them'. -Distorting spacetime?
"01:01:03,975","01:01:06,279",Don't. Don't!
"01:01:33,900","01:01:34,869",What was that?
"01:01:37,255","01:01:39,378",First handshake.
"01:01:41,054","01:01:42,322",We're...
"01:01:43,405","01:01:44,737",We're here.
"01:02:05,707","01:02:08,910",So the lost communications came through. -How?
"01:02:09,023","01:02:13,985","The relay on this side cached them. It's years of basic data, no real surprises."
"01:02:14,966","01:02:19,480","Miller's site has kept pinging 'thumbs up', as has Dr. Mann's."
"01:02:19,515","01:02:23,319",Edmunds went down three years ago. -Transmitter failure?
"01:02:23,428","01:02:26,313",Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up right until it went dark.
"01:02:26,462","01:02:30,079","But Miller's still looks good though, right? Because she's coming up fast."
"01:02:30,191","01:02:32,428",But there's one complication.
"01:02:32,501","01:02:36,577",The planet is much closer to Gargantua than we thought.
"01:02:36,648","01:02:39,775",Gargantua? -It's what we're calling the black hole.
"01:02:39,925","01:02:41,967",Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets both orbit it.
"01:02:42,002","01:02:45,194",And Miller's is on the horizon? -Like a basketball around a hoop.
"01:02:45,308","01:02:47,915",Landing there takes us dangerously close...
"01:02:48,091","01:02:51,185",...and a black hole that big has a huge gravitational pull.
"01:02:53,298","01:02:56,820","Okay I-, I could swing around that neutron star..."
"01:02:56,934","01:02:59,485","-No no no, it's not that, it's time. The gravity on that planet will..."
"01:02:59,632","01:03:02,920","...slow our clock compared to Earth's,.. drastically."
"01:03:02,955","01:03:04,683",Well how bad?
"01:03:04,794","01:03:11,596","Well, every hour we spend on that planet will be, uhh, seven years back on Earth."
"01:03:12,927","01:03:15,804",Jesus. -That's relativity folks.
"01:03:16,930","01:03:20,204","Well, we can't just drop down there without... -Cooper..."
"01:03:20,352","01:03:22,790","We have a mission. -Yeah Doyle, we have a mission."
"01:03:22,896","01:03:25,437","And our mission, Plan A is to find a planet..."
"01:03:25,472","01:03:27,978",...that can habitate the people that are living on the Earth right now.
"01:03:28,087","01:03:30,714","You can't just think about your family, now you have to think bigger than that, alright?"
"01:03:30,864","01:03:33,809",I'm thinking about my family and millions of other families.
"01:03:33,891","01:03:38,816","Okay, Plan A does not work, if the people on Earth are dead by the time we pull it off."
"01:03:39,686","01:03:43,058","No, it doesn't. That's why there's a Plan B."
"01:03:44,754","01:03:49,225",Okay. Cooper's right. We have to think about time as a resource just like...
"01:03:49,335","01:03:51,676",...oxygen and food. Going down there is gonna cost us.
"01:03:51,858","01:03:58,048","Okay look, Dr. Mann's data is promising, alright,"
"01:03:58,192","01:04:01,670","but it's gonna take us months to get there, and Edmunds, it's even further."
"01:04:01,705","01:04:04,237",Now Miller hasn't said much. But what she has said is very promising.
"01:04:04,387","01:04:07,141","It's water, it's organics. -You don't find that everyday."
"01:04:07,219","01:04:10,662","No, you don't and just think about the resources including time..."
"01:04:10,780","01:04:13,038",...that would be spent trying to get back here.
"01:04:14,526","01:04:16,148",Romilly. -Yeah.
"01:04:16,183","01:04:20,594",How far off of Miller's planet do we have to be to stay out of the time shift?
"01:04:20,629","01:04:24,876","Alright, just back from the cusp. -Which is here, just outside of Miller's planet."
"01:04:24,992","01:04:27,428",Alright. Okay.
"01:04:27,547","01:04:30,811","Here's Gargantua, here's Miller's planet."
"01:04:30,959","01:04:34,597","Instead of taking the Endurance into orbit around Miller's planet, which would..."
"01:04:34,632","01:04:37,443","...conserve fuel, but we'd lose a lot of time,"
"01:04:37,478","01:04:42,016","what if, what if we take a wider orbit around Gargantua, parallel with Miller's planet,"
"01:04:42,125","01:04:45,546","outside of it's time shift, to here. Then we take the Ranger down,"
"01:04:45,581","01:04:48,565","we get Miller, we get her samples, we come back, we analyze, we debrief..."
"01:04:48,600","01:04:52,421","...we're in, we're out, we lose a little fuel. But we save a lot of time."
"01:04:52,538","01:04:54,442",That'll work. -That's good. -There's not gonna...
"01:04:54,593","01:04:58,340","be time for monkey business or chit-chat down there, so TARS, you should definitely stay here."
"01:04:59,498","01:05:02,135","CASE, you're with me. Anyone else can stay."
"01:05:02,282","01:05:04,591","If we are talking about a couple of years,"
"01:05:04,786","01:05:06,868","I could use the time to research gravity,"
"01:05:07,013","01:05:09,499","observations from the wormhole, that's gold to Professor Brand."
"01:05:09,609","01:05:13,903","TARS, factor an orbit around Gargantua, conserve fuel, minimize thrusting."
"01:05:14,018","01:05:16,427",Make sure we stay in range from Miller's planet. You got it?
"01:05:16,545","01:05:19,759","I wouldn't leave you behind, Dr. Brand."
"01:05:24,478","01:05:28,101",You ready CASE? -Yep. -You don't say much do you?
"01:05:28,713","01:05:33,009",TARS talks plenty for both of us. -Detach.
"01:05:39,889","01:05:43,187","Romilly, are you reading these forces? -Unbelievable."
"01:05:46,930","01:05:48,622",A literal heart of darkness.
"01:05:51,504","01:05:55,777","If we could just see the collapsed star inside,"
"01:05:55,925","01:05:58,798","the singularity, we'd solve gravity."
"01:05:58,911","01:06:02,265","We can't get anything from it? -Nothing escapes that horizon,"
"01:06:02,416","01:06:06,317","not even light. All the answers are there, just no way to see it."
"01:06:06,469","01:06:07,827",There's Miller's planet.
"01:06:10,395","01:06:11,357",Goodbye Ranger.
"01:06:24,117","01:06:28,549",This is fast for atmospheric entry. Shouldn't we use the thrusters to slow?
"01:06:28,629","01:06:32,710",-No. I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics to save some fuel.
"01:06:32,819","01:06:35,849",Air-brake? -We wanna get down fast don't we?
"01:06:35,957","01:06:39,352",Actually we wanna get there in one piece. -Hang on.
"01:06:39,425","01:06:41,110","Brand, Doyle, get ready."
"01:06:56,945","01:06:59,677",We should be using the air-brake. -Hands up CASE.
"01:06:59,757","01:07:03,176",The only time I ever went down is when a machine was easing at the wrong time.
"01:07:03,290","01:07:06,406",You're going to get us killed. -Just like reckless driving.
"01:07:06,682","01:07:08,323",We're too fast. -I got this.
"01:07:13,055","01:07:17,126",Should I get ready to detach? -No. I need to feel the air.
"01:07:21,131","01:07:22,326",Here we go.
"01:07:23,771","01:07:26,574",It's just water!
"01:07:26,683","01:07:31,430",The stuff of life. -1200 meters.
"01:07:31,547","01:07:34,622","Do we have a fix on her beacon? -That I have, can you maneuver?"
"01:07:34,731","01:07:39,534","I gonna need to shave some speed. I'm gonna spiral down on top of it, everybody hang on!"
"01:07:40,941","01:07:42,855",700.
"01:07:44,801","01:07:47,154","On my cue CASE, on my cue."
"01:07:49,988","01:07:51,429",500 meters.
"01:08:00,614","01:08:02,056",Now!
"01:08:16,132","01:08:17,381",Very graceful.
"01:08:17,451","01:08:21,873","No, but very efficient."
"01:08:23,331","01:08:26,081",What're you waiting for? Let's go.
"01:08:26,151","01:08:29,862","Go, go, go, go. 7 years per hour here."
"01:08:29,969","01:08:31,262",Let's make it count.
"01:08:57,449","01:08:58,336",This way.
"01:09:00,965","01:09:03,055",About 200 meters.
"01:09:13,062","01:09:17,664",Gravity's punishing. -Been floating through space too long?
"01:09:17,777","01:09:20,078",130% Earth's gravity.
"01:09:21,450","01:09:22,834","Come on, come on, come on."
"01:09:24,996","01:09:27,407",There's nothing here. -should be right here.
"01:09:29,075","01:09:32,537","If the, if the signal's coming from here, then..."
"01:09:41,939","01:09:43,128",Her beacon.
"01:09:51,083","01:09:54,360",Wreckage. -Where's the rest?
"01:09:54,433","01:09:56,165",Towards the mountains.
"01:09:59,483","01:10:01,533",Those aren't mountains.
"01:10:04,048","01:10:06,395",They're waves. -What?
"01:10:09,894","01:10:11,372",Shit.
"01:10:13,467","01:10:15,588",That one's moving away from us.
"01:10:20,665","01:10:23,433",We need the recorder.
"01:10:33,625","01:10:36,326","Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!"
"01:10:36,404","01:10:38,674","I'm not, leaving, without, her data."
"01:10:40,012","01:10:44,278",Get back here now. We do not have time. The second wave is coming!
"01:10:44,391","01:10:46,866",We are in the middle of a swell!
"01:10:46,975","01:10:50,752",Get your ass back to the Ranger now!
"01:10:54,285","01:10:57,591",Brand get back here now!!
"01:10:59,026","01:11:02,937","Cooper, go, Cooper go, I can't make it. Go!"
"01:11:03,050","01:11:04,270","CASE, go get her."
"01:11:08,360","01:11:11,634","GO! -Get up, get up Brand."
"01:11:11,779","01:11:13,494","Go go, go."
"01:11:14,686","01:11:18,350",I'm not gonna make it! -Yes you are. Yes you are!
"01:11:24,990","01:11:27,573","Come on CASE has her, CASE has her! Get back here Doyle!"
"01:11:30,346","01:11:31,821",Dr. Brand.
"01:11:33,515","01:11:35,275",To the hatch.
"01:11:39,360","01:11:41,302","Go, go. Go."
"01:11:46,824","01:11:50,861",Manually overriding inside hatch!
"01:11:54,208","01:11:58,918",Cooper don't! Cooper don't!
"01:11:59,081","01:12:00,152",Cooper!
"01:12:02,001","01:12:05,848",Engines are flooded! I'll have to shut it down!
"01:12:38,989","01:12:40,644",Oh shit!!
"01:12:45,428","01:12:46,761",Whoaa!
"01:13:17,867","01:13:21,064","CASE what's wrong? -Chute's waterlogged, let it drain."
"01:13:21,895","01:13:25,457",Goddamn it!! I told you to leave me.
"01:13:25,569","01:13:27,974",-And I told you to get your ass back here!
"01:13:28,048","01:13:31,669",The difference is that one of us was thinkin' about the mission.
"01:13:31,778","01:13:33,619",-You were thinking about getting home!!
"01:13:34,642","01:13:39,614",I was trying to do the right thing! -Can you tell that to Doyle?
"01:13:41,551","01:13:44,504","CASE, how much time? -45 to an hour."
"01:13:45,911","01:13:47,626",The stuff of life huh?
"01:13:48,674","01:13:51,610",What's this gonna cost us Brand? -A lot.
"01:13:52,493","01:13:53,308",Decades.
"01:14:00,503","01:14:03,384",What happened to Miller? -Judging by...
"01:14:03,499","01:14:07,307",...the wreckage she was broken up by a wave soon after impact.
"01:14:07,417","01:14:10,878","How's the hell the wreckage stayed together after all these years, huh?"
"01:14:12,141","01:14:13,722",Because of the time slippage.
"01:14:13,869","01:14:17,491","On this planet's time she,"
"01:14:17,603","01:14:19,624","she's landed hours ago, she..."
"01:14:19,699","01:14:22,653",...she probably just died minutes ago.
"01:14:22,764","01:14:26,609",The data Doyle received was just the initial status echoing endlessly.
"01:14:26,720","01:14:29,092",Oh we are not prepared for this.
"01:14:31,509","01:14:35,784",You eggheads have the survival skills of a boy-scout troop.
"01:14:35,816","01:14:38,904","Well we got this far on our brains, farther than any human in history."
"01:14:39,224","01:14:43,573",Well not far enough. And now we're stuck here till there won't be anyone...
"01:14:43,574","01:14:44,760",...left on Earth to save.
"01:14:46,683","01:14:50,242",I'm counting every minute same as you Cooper.
"01:14:53,993","01:14:58,875","Is there any possibility? I dunno, maybe some way, I don't know..."
"01:14:58,876","01:15:03,000",...maybe if we could jump in a black hole and gain back the years?
"01:14:14,502","01:14:17,857","Don't shake your head at me! Time is relative, okay."
"01:15:06,965","01:15:09,212","It can stretch and it can squeeze, but,"
"01:15:09,282","01:15:13,031",it can't run backwards! Just can't!
"01:15:13,109","01:15:17,300","The only thing that can move across dimensions, like time, is gravity."
"01:15:19,612","01:15:20,939",Okay.
"01:15:22,809","01:15:25,508","The beings that led us here,"
"01:15:25,619","01:15:28,712","they communicate through gravity, right?"
"01:15:28,863","01:15:32,786",Could they be talking to us from the future? -Maybe.
"01:15:32,899","01:15:36,403","Okay, if they can..? They..."
"01:15:36,518","01:15:39,171",...are beings of 5 dimensions!
"01:15:39,288","01:15:42,904","Right, to them, time might be yet another physical dimension."
"01:15:42,991","01:15:47,532","To them, the past might be a canyon they can climb into,"
"01:15:47,638","01:15:52,360","and the future, a mountain that they can climb up, but to us, it's not! Okay!"
"01:15:52,435","01:15:56,376","Look Cooper, I screwed up. I'm sorry."
"01:15:57,674","01:15:59,721",But you knew about relativity.
"01:16:02,533","01:16:03,509",Brand.
"01:16:07,627","01:16:10,586",My daughter is 10 years old.
"01:16:10,701","01:16:13,962","Couldn't teach her Einstein's theories before I left,"
"01:16:13,997","01:16:18,643",Couldn't you have told your daughter that you were going to save the world? -No.
"01:16:19,768","01:16:24,476","When you become a parent, one thing becomes really clear,"
"01:16:25,460","01:16:29,273","And that's you wanna make sure your children feel safe,"
"01:16:30,281","01:16:34,101","and it rules out telling a 10 year old, that the world's endin'."
"01:16:36,416","01:16:37,421",Cooper.
"01:16:41,141","01:16:44,543",How long for the engines CASE? -A minute or two.
"01:16:44,618","01:16:46,790",Well we don't have it! Helmets on!!
"01:16:50,473","01:16:55,283","Brand, co-pilot you're up. CASE, run the cabin oxygen through the main thrusters."
"01:16:55,394","01:16:57,346",We're gonna spark it! -Roger that.
"01:16:57,459","01:16:58,658",Depressurizing.
"01:17:03,950","01:17:05,172",Engines up!
"01:17:34,169","01:17:38,086",Hello Rom! -I've waited years.
"01:17:39,236","01:17:40,807","How many, how many years?"
"01:17:42,444","01:17:47,416","By now it must be, 23 years, 4 months, 8 days."
"01:17:51,166","01:17:52,461",Doyle?
"01:17:59,562","01:18:02,914",I thought I was prepared...I knew the theory...
"01:18:02,985","01:18:05,501",...reality is different.
"01:18:06,518","01:18:07,373",And Miller?
"01:18:08,678","01:18:10,548",There's nothing here for us.
"01:18:14,229","01:18:18,077",Why didn't you sleep? -Oh I had a couple of stretches.
"01:18:18,150","01:18:21,037",I stopped believing that you were coming back.
"01:18:21,116","01:18:23,954",Something seemed wrong about dreaming my life away.
"01:18:24,023","01:18:27,017",I learned what I could from the black hole
"01:18:27,160","01:18:29,488",but I couldn't send anything to your father.
"01:18:29,600","01:18:34,370",We've been receiving but nothing gets out. -Is he alive?
"01:18:34,453","01:18:37,416","Oh, yeah. -Yeah? -Yeah."
"01:18:40,080","01:18:44,342",We've got years of messages stored. -Cooper.
"01:18:44,451","01:18:47,804",Messages span 23 years.
"01:18:49,420","01:18:51,359",Play from the beginning.
"01:18:54,732","01:18:59,551","Hey Dad, Just checkin' in, sayin' hi."
"01:19:00,856","01:19:04,198","Umm, finished 2nd in school,"
"01:19:04,308","01:19:07,906","Miss Carlin's still giving me Cs though,"
"01:19:08,055","01:19:11,213","pulled me down, but second's not bad."
"01:19:12,364","01:19:14,631",Grandpa attended the ceremony.
"01:19:16,227","01:19:20,709","Umm, oh, I met another girl dad."
"01:19:20,752","01:19:25,769","I uh, I really think this is the one."
"01:19:26,286","01:19:28,901",Her name is Lois. That's her right there.
"01:19:32,575","01:19:34,195","Murphy stole grandpa's car,"
"01:19:34,303","01:19:37,971","She crashed it, she's okay though."
"01:19:38,042","01:19:42,838",Hey Dad. Look at this!
"01:19:42,917","01:19:47,272",You're a grandpa! His name's Jesse.
"01:19:47,377","01:19:52,528","I wanted to go with Coop, but Lois says maybe next time."
"01:19:52,651","01:19:55,103","And Donald says he's already got the 'great' part so,"
"01:19:55,176","01:19:57,637",we're not to call him that.
"01:19:57,752","01:20:01,797",
"01:19:12,870","01:19:15,755",Say goodbye to Grandpa.
"01:20:04,861","01:20:07,815",Goodbye grandpa.
"01:20:07,890","01:20:09,725","Sorry, it's been a while."
"01:20:10,945","01:20:17,016","It's..., what with Jesse and all..."
"01:20:21,466","01:20:25,776","Uhh, grandpa died last week."
"01:20:25,883","01:20:28,548",We buried him out in the back 40 next to mom...
"01:20:28,549","01:20:31,110",...and Jesse.
"01:20:32,490","01:20:37,018","Which is where we would've buried you, if you would've ever,... come back."
"01:20:38,167","01:20:40,468",Murph was there at the funeral.
"01:20:41,478","01:20:44,130","We don't see her that much, but she came for that."
"01:20:47,350","01:20:50,067","You're not listening to this, I know."
"01:20:53,069","01:20:58,606","All these messages are just, ... drifting..."
"01:20:58,713","01:21:00,977",out there in the darkness.
"01:21:01,085","01:21:07,179","Lois says that, uh... I have to let you go."
"01:21:08,369","01:21:09,376",And uh...
"01:21:10,688","01:21:11,524",...so...
"01:21:14,082","01:21:18,026",I guess... I'll let you go.
"01:21:19,076","01:21:21,267",I don't know where you're dad.
"01:21:21,377","01:21:24,941",But I hope that you're at peace. And...
"01:21:25,052","01:21:27,559",Goodbye.
"01:21:39,993","01:21:42,220",Hey Dad.
"01:21:45,284","01:21:48,202",Hey Murph. -You son of a bitch!
"01:21:51,599","01:21:54,899","I never made one of these when you were still responding,"
"01:21:54,900","01:21:56,773",because I was so mad at you for leaving.
"01:21:59,175","01:22:02,013","And then when you went quiet,"
"01:22:04,819","01:22:07,945","it felt like I should've lived with that decision, and I have,"
"01:22:11,913","01:22:14,525","but today is my birthday,"
"01:22:17,818","01:22:21,562","And it's a special one, because you told me,"
"01:22:24,499","01:22:27,842",you once told me that when you come back...
"01:22:27,956","01:22:29,869",...we might be the same age.
"01:22:31,569","01:22:34,753",And today I'm the age you were when you left.
"01:22:37,641","01:22:41,019",So it would be a real good time for you to come back!
"01:22:53,191","01:22:55,660","I didn't mean to intrude,"
"01:22:56,596","01:23:00,748",It's just that I've never seen you in here before. -Because I've never been in here before.
"01:23:03,124","01:23:07,580","I talk to Amelia, all the time. It helps."
"01:23:07,731","01:23:11,803",I'm glad you've started. -I haven't.
"01:23:11,915","01:23:16,282",Just had something which needed to get out. -I know they're still out there.
"01:23:16,391","01:23:16,685",I know.
"01:23:16,802","01:23:21,646",There are so many reasons why our communications might not be getting through.
"01:23:21,763","01:23:22,944",I know Professor.
"01:23:23,058","01:23:27,092","I'm not sure, what I'm more afraid of."
"01:23:27,205","01:23:30,200",Them never coming back or...
"01:23:30,270","01:23:34,351",...coming back to find we've failed.
"01:23:34,464","01:23:37,861","Then let's succeed. -So,"
"01:23:37,968","01:23:42,867",back to the fourth iteration. Let's run it through some new fields.
"01:23:42,978","01:23:46,558","With respect Professor, we've tried that hundreds of times."
"01:23:46,670","01:23:50,189","-It only has to work once, Murph."
"01:23:53,433","01:23:56,844",Every rivet that they strike could've been a bullet.
"01:23:56,921","01:23:59,990","We've done well, in the world here,"
"01:24:00,098","01:24:04,155","whether or not we crack the equation, before I kick the bucket."
"01:24:04,268","01:24:07,939",Don't be morbid Professor. -I'm not afraid of death.
"01:24:08,047","01:24:09,810",I am an old physicist.
"01:24:11,444","01:24:13,096",I'm afraid of time.
"01:24:19,732","01:24:21,434",Time.
"01:24:23,616","01:24:25,449",You're afraid of time.
"01:24:27,400","01:24:30,460",For years we've been trying to solve the equation without changing...
"01:24:30,547","01:24:33,139",...the underlying assumption about time. -And?
"01:24:33,293","01:24:37,252","What it means, is each iteration is an attempt to prove it's own proof,"
"01:24:37,330","01:24:41,200","it's recursive,...it's nonsensical."
"01:24:41,340","01:24:45,047","Are you calling my life's work nonsense, Murph?"
"01:24:46,329","01:24:49,374","No, I'm saying that you've been trying to finish it with one arm..."
"01:24:49,375","01:24:53,190","...no, with both arms tied behind your back."
"01:24:54,623","01:24:56,212",And I don't understand why.
"01:24:57,325","01:24:59,115",I am an old man Murph.
"01:24:59,224","01:25:02,751",Can we take this point up at another time?
"01:25:02,862","01:25:04,914",I want to talk to my daughter.
"01:25:06,429","01:25:09,810","Stepping out into the universe,"
"01:25:09,927","01:25:14,050",we must confront the reality of interstellar travel.
"01:25:14,162","01:25:18,296",We must reach far beyond our own lifespans.
"01:25:19,557","01:25:22,304","We must think, not as individuals,"
"01:25:22,416","01:25:24,614",but as a species.
"01:25:25,946","01:25:30,937",'Do not go gentle into that good night.'
"01:25:31,486","01:25:34,588",TARS kept the Endurance right where we needed her...
"01:25:34,663","01:25:37,398",...but the trip took years longer than what we anticipated.
"01:25:37,507","01:25:40,334","We no longer have the fuel to visit both our prospects,"
"01:25:40,410","01:25:42,993","so, we've got to choose."
"01:25:44,648","01:25:45,228",But how?
"01:25:46,595","01:25:48,076",They're both promising.
"01:25:49,378","01:25:51,769","And Edmunds data is better,"
"01:25:51,770","01:25:54,553",but Dr. Mann is the one who's still transmitting. So...
"01:25:54,663","01:25:57,474",We've got no reason to suspect Edmunds data would've soured.
"01:25:58,592","01:26:02,804",His world has key elements to sustain human life. -As does Dr. Mann's.
"01:26:02,877","01:26:04,245","Cooper, this is my field."
"01:26:05,730","01:26:10,245",And I really believe Edmund's is the better prospect. -Why?
"01:26:10,358","01:26:15,350","Gargantua, that's why. Look at Miller's planet."
"01:26:15,461","01:26:19,654","Hydrocarbons, organics, yes; But no life. Sterile."
"01:26:19,668","01:26:24,511",We'll find the same thing on Mann's. -Because of the black hole?
"01:26:24,587","01:26:28,087","-Murphy's Law. Whatever can happen, will happen."
"01:26:28,195","01:26:30,865","Accidents are the first building block of evolution,"
"01:26:31,017","01:26:34,398","but when you're orbiting a black hole, not enough can happen,"
"01:26:34,513","01:26:38,378","it sucks in asteroids, comets, other events which would otherwise reach you."
"01:26:38,487","01:26:39,767",We need to go further afield.
"01:26:40,516","01:26:46,301","You once said that Dr. Mann, was the best of us."
"01:26:46,411","01:26:50,058",He is remarkable. we're only here because of him.
"01:26:50,165","01:26:53,440","And, and yet here he is, he is on the ground,"
"01:26:53,588","01:26:58,209","and he's sending a very unambiguous message, telling us to come to his planet."
"01:26:59,194","01:27:03,954",-Granted. But Edmund's data is more promising.
"01:27:04,027","01:27:07,834","-We should vote. -Well, if we're going to vote, there's something you should know,"
"01:27:07,944","01:27:11,447","Brand, he has a right to know."
"01:27:11,521","01:27:14,953",That has nothing to do with it. -What does?
"01:27:15,066","01:27:18,210",She's in love with Wolf Edmunds. -Is that true?
"01:27:18,323","01:27:19,545",Yes.
"01:27:22,293","01:27:25,460",And that makes me want to follow my heart.
"01:27:28,633","01:27:32,678","Maybe we've spent too long trying to figure all this out with theory,"
"01:27:32,756","01:27:35,881","-You're a scientist Brand. -So listen to me,"
"01:27:35,996","01:27:40,640","When I say that love isn't something we invented, it's..."
"01:27:40,752","01:27:44,314","...observable, powerful."
"01:27:46,227","01:27:50,933","It has to mean something. -Love has meaning, yes, social utility..."
"01:27:50,934","01:27:54,521","...social bonding, child rearing, -We love people who have died,"
"01:27:54,628","01:27:58,565",where's the social utility in that? -None.
"01:27:58,676","01:28:01,473","-Maybe it means something more, something we can't..."
"01:28:01,546","01:28:04,566",...yet understand.
"01:28:04,633","01:28:07,977","Maybe it's, some evidence, some..."
"01:28:08,855","01:28:13,626","...artifact of a higher dimension... that we can't consciously perceive,"
"01:28:13,749","01:28:16,651",I'm drawn across the universe to someone...
"01:28:16,724","01:28:21,351","...I haven't seen in a decade. Who, I know, is probably dead."
"01:28:21,462","01:28:24,485",Love is the one thing we're capable...
"01:28:24,555","01:28:27,778",...of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space.
"01:28:29,041","01:28:32,107","Maybe we should trust that,"
"01:28:32,178","01:28:35,110",even if we can't understand it yet.
"01:28:38,591","01:28:40,821","Alright Cooper,"
"01:28:43,238","01:28:44,176",Yes!
"01:28:45,687","01:28:48,895",The tiniest possibility of seeing Wolf again excites me.
"01:28:49,116","01:28:53,843","But that doesn't mean I'm wrong. -Honestly Amelia,"
"01:28:55,757","01:28:57,122",it might.
"01:29:02,842","01:29:06,615","TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's."
"01:29:22,790","01:29:31,891","We'll lose about a third again. Next year. Next year, I'm gonna work Nelson's farm and I'm gonna make it up."
"01:29:32,004","01:29:33,910",What happened to Nelson?
"01:29:39,708","01:29:44,608","Murph, can I get you anything? Would you like some more Soufflé? -No, I'm full. Thanks."
"01:29:44,719","01:29:45,583",It was delicious.
"01:29:46,987","01:29:48,426",Hand me that donut please.
"01:29:50,551","01:29:54,993",Will you spend the night? Your room is exactly as you left it. It's...
"01:29:55,028","01:29:58,379","-I need to get back. -My sewing machine is in there, but there's plenty..."
"01:29:58,449","01:30:01,454",-I need to...
"01:30:02,892","01:30:07,037","...too many memories. -Well, we have something for that."
"01:30:07,153","01:30:08,405",
"01:29:26,812","01:29:27,915",Dust.
"01:30:18,535","01:30:21,811","Lois, I have a friend who could..."
"01:30:21,891","01:30:24,080",...look at his lungs.
"01:30:42,236","01:30:45,263","Amelia, I'm sorry. -You're just being objective."
"01:30:45,335","01:30:48,530","Unless you're punishing me, for screwing up on Miller's planet,"
"01:30:48,733","01:30:50,737","-No, this wasn't a personal decision."
"01:30:50,813","01:30:55,272","Well, if you're wrong, you have a very personal decision to make."
"01:30:55,383","01:30:59,415",Your fuel calculations are based on a return journey.
"01:30:59,524","01:31:02,464",Strike out on Mann's planet and you'll have to decide whether...
"01:31:02,539","01:31:06,026","...to return home, or push onto Edmunds with plan B."
"01:31:06,190","01:31:09,999",Starting a colony could save us from extinction.
"01:31:10,113","01:31:12,853",You might have to decide between seeing your children again...
"01:31:12,964","01:31:14,901",...or the future of the human race.
"01:31:16,052","01:31:17,973",I trust you'll be as objective then.
"01:31:24,122","01:31:27,397",He has been asking for you since he came to.
"01:31:27,472","01:31:28,770",We were trying to reach you.
"01:31:34,461","01:31:38,155",Murph? -Hey. I'm here Professor.
"01:31:38,264","01:31:41,644",I think I let all down.
"01:31:41,758","01:31:44,820","No, you got us this far. We're close."
"01:31:46,161","01:31:48,399",I will finish what you started.
"01:31:48,513","01:31:51,630","Good, good Murph."
"01:31:51,744","01:31:55,938",You had faith.
"01:31:56,011","01:32:01,484","All those, all those years,"
"01:32:02,356","01:32:06,483","I asked you to have faith,"
"01:32:07,609","01:32:18,635","I wanted you to believe, that your father,... would come back."
"01:32:19,032","01:32:20,903",I do Professor.
"01:32:22,637","01:32:26,559",Forgive me Murph. -There's nothing to forgive.
"01:32:28,467","01:32:33,286","I lied Murph,"
"01:32:34,405","01:32:36,716",I lied to you.
"01:32:42,441","01:32:49,399","There was no need for him, to come back."
"01:32:50,570","01:32:55,786",There's no way to help us.
"01:32:55,859","01:32:59,193",But the Plan A? All this?
"01:33:00,029","01:33:04,570",All these people. And the equation?
"01:33:07,546","01:33:09,881",Did my father know?
"01:33:12,761","01:33:15,383",Did he leave me?
"01:33:18,050","01:33:28,204",'Do....not....go....gentle....'
"01:33:28,396","01:33:34,176",No. NO!
"01:33:34,294","01:33:38,595",You can't leave. NO!!
"01:33:38,705","01:33:42,801","Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you that your father died today."
"01:33:42,908","01:33:46,007",He didn't feel any pain. He was at peace.
"01:33:46,087","01:33:48,854",I'm very sorry for your loss.
"01:34:01,439","01:34:03,637",Brand did you know?
"01:34:05,154","01:34:07,431",He told you right?
"01:34:09,032","01:34:11,692",You knew?
"01:34:12,743","01:34:15,191",This was all a sham.
"01:34:19,826","01:34:21,444",You left us here.
"01:34:22,782","01:34:25,263",To suffocate.
"01:34:26,522","01:34:28,354",To starve.
"01:34:55,363","01:34:57,534",Frozen cloud.
"01:37:21,492","01:37:24,756",It's okay.
"01:37:30,013","01:37:33,026",It's okay.
"01:37:33,144","01:37:35,086",It's okay.
"01:37:37,882","01:37:40,167","Pray you never learn,"
"01:37:41,542","01:37:44,522",just how good it can be to see another face.
"01:37:52,707","01:37:57,997",I hadn't had a lot of hope to begin with. After so long I had none.
"01:37:59,727","01:38:02,460",My supplies were completely exhausted.
"01:38:04,338","01:38:08,535","The last time I went to sleep, I didn't even set up a waking date."
"01:38:12,291","01:38:14,993",You've literally raised me from the dead.
"01:38:16,008","01:38:17,228",Lazarus.
"01:38:18,384","01:38:22,372",What about the others? -I'm afraid you're it sir.
"01:38:23,385","01:38:25,302","So far, surely."
"01:38:25,878","01:38:28,556",No. In our present situation...
"01:38:28,669","01:38:31,363",...there's very little chance of rescuing any others.
"01:38:34,452","01:38:35,873",Dr. Mann.
"01:38:36,243","01:38:39,508","Dr. Mann, tell us about your world."
"01:38:42,702","01:38:44,757","Our world, we hope..."
"01:38:47,146","01:38:56,239","Our world is cold, stark, but undeniably beautiful."
"01:38:58,158","01:39:01,488","The days are 67 hours long, cold."
"01:39:05,378","01:39:09,297",The nights are 67 far colder hours.
"01:39:14,302","01:39:20,217","The gravity is a very, very pleasant 80% of the Earth's."
"01:39:20,331","01:39:23,502","Now here, where I landed, the water is alkali."
"01:39:23,619","01:39:27,316",And the air has too much ammonia in it to breathe for more than just a few minutes.
"01:39:27,317","01:39:31,996","But, down at the surface, and there is, a surface,"
"01:39:32,066","01:39:36,643","the chlorine dissipates, the ammonia gives way to crystalline hydrocarbons."
"01:39:36,751","01:39:39,486","Breathable air, to organics."
"01:39:39,596","01:39:42,333","Possibly even, to life."
"01:39:42,414","01:39:45,258",We might be sharing this world.
"01:39:45,370","01:39:47,654",These readings are from the surface?
"01:39:47,770","01:39:52,487","Over the years, I've dropped various probes. -How far have you explored?"
"01:39:52,596","01:39:55,547","I have managed several major expeditions, but with oxygen in..."
"01:39:55,621","01:40:00,567","...limited supply, KIPP there, really did most of the legwork. -What went wrong with him sir?"
"01:40:00,646","01:40:03,471",Degeneration. He misidentified the first organics...
"01:40:03,472","01:40:08,436","...we found as ammonia crystals. We struggled on for a time, but..."
"01:40:08,510","01:40:12,405","...ultimately I decommissioned him, used his power source to keep the mission going."
"01:40:12,594","01:40:16,770",I thought I was alone before I even shut him down. -Would you like me to take a look at him?
"01:40:16,842","01:40:20,190","No, no, needs a human touch."
"01:40:20,262","01:40:22,511","Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message..."
"01:40:22,512","01:40:26,800","...for you, from the spaceship. -Okay, be right there. Excuse me."
"01:40:39,119","01:40:42,392","Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you that your father died today."
"01:40:42,505","01:40:48,199",He had no pain. He was at peace.
"01:40:50,516","01:40:52,501",I'm sorry for your loss.
"01:40:54,880","01:40:59,714","Is that Murph? -She's,...she's grown!"
"01:40:59,787","01:41:00,798",Brand did you know?
"01:41:02,206","01:41:03,721",He told you right?
"01:41:06,063","01:41:08,073",You knew?
"01:41:09,597","01:41:13,851",This was all a sham. You left us here.
"01:41:15,006","01:41:17,669",To suffocate.
"01:41:19,370","01:41:21,070",To starve.
"01:41:24,777","01:41:26,330",Did my father know too?
"01:41:28,601","01:41:29,789",Dad!
"01:41:32,026","01:41:37,997","I just want to know, if you left me here to die?"
"01:41:39,157","01:41:42,080",I just have to know!
"01:41:47,197","01:41:55,934","Cooper, my father dedicated his whole life to plan A, I have..."
"01:41:56,009","01:41:58,131",...no idea what she's talking about.
"01:41:59,217","01:42:00,702",I do.
"01:42:05,133","01:42:09,017","He, he never even hoped to get the people off the Earth?"
"01:42:09,090","01:42:10,708",No.
"01:42:15,180","01:42:18,991",But he has been trying to solve the gravity equation for 40 years.
"01:42:19,100","01:42:23,312","Amelia, your father solved his equation before I even left."
"01:42:23,386","01:42:25,302",Then why wouldn't he use it?
"01:42:25,411","01:42:29,878",The equation couldn't reconcile relativity with quantum mechanics You need more.
"01:42:29,951","01:42:34,574",More? More what? -More data. You need to see into a black hole.
"01:42:34,575","01:42:38,715","The laws of nature prohibit a naked singularity. -Romilly, is that true?"
"01:42:39,553","01:42:43,793","If the black hole is an oyster, then the singularity is the pearl inside."
"01:42:43,960","01:42:46,213",The gravity is so strong that it is always hidden...
"01:42:46,286","01:42:48,045","...in darkness, beyond the horizon."
"01:42:49,136","01:42:51,366",That's why we call it a 'black' hole.
"01:42:51,475","01:42:55,700","Okay,...what if we see beyond the horizon?"
"01:42:55,775","01:42:59,862",We can't Cooper. -There are some things that aren't meant to be known.
"01:42:59,970","01:43:04,397",Your father had to find another way to save the human race from extinction.
"01:43:04,440","01:43:07,964","Plan B, a colony. -But why not tell people?"
"01:43:09,413","01:43:10,793",Why keep it from us?
"01:43:10,907","01:43:13,283",Because he knew how hard it would be to get people...
"01:43:13,284","01:43:18,282",...to work together to save the species instead of themselves. Or their children.
"01:43:18,387","01:43:19,471",Bullshit!
"01:43:19,579","01:43:22,324",You never would have come here unless you believed you were gonna save them.
"01:43:22,438","01:43:25,198",Evolution has yet to transcend that simple barrier.
"01:43:25,272","01:43:29,482","We can care deeply, selflessly about those we know."
"01:43:29,553","01:43:33,911",But that empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight. -But the lie?
"01:43:37,263","01:43:41,839",That monstrous lie? -Unforgivable.
"01:43:41,951","01:43:46,738","And he knew that. He was prepared to destroy his own humanity,"
"01:43:46,850","01:43:50,342","in order to save the species, he made an incredible sacrifice."
"01:43:50,456","01:43:54,950","NO! No, an incredible sacrifice is being made,"
"01:43:55,025","01:43:57,929",by the people on Earth who're gonna die!
"01:43:57,936","01:44:02,581","Because in his fucking arrogance, he declared their case hopeless."
"01:44:02,688","01:44:07,145","I'm sorry Cooper, their case is hopeless."
"01:44:07,187","01:44:11,413",No. No. -We are the future.
"01:44:12,852","01:44:14,073",Cooper.
"01:44:15,201","01:44:16,752","Cooper, what I can do?"
"01:44:19,635","01:44:21,509",Let me go home.
"01:44:22,016","01:44:24,679",You're absolutely positive?
"01:44:24,792","01:44:29,297",His solution was correct. He's had it for years. -It's worthless?
"01:44:29,368","01:44:30,999",It's half the answer.
"01:44:31,585","01:44:35,132","Okay, how do you find the other half?"
"01:44:35,245","01:44:38,384","Out there, in a black hole. But stuck down on Earth?"
"01:44:38,493","01:44:40,007",Yeah?
"01:44:41,235","01:44:42,744",I'm not sure you can.
"01:44:43,689","01:44:47,589","God, they just pack up and leave."
"01:44:49,208","01:44:52,976",What're they hoping to find? -Survival.
"01:45:00,224","01:45:01,555",Damn it!
"01:45:04,623","01:45:08,469","Murph, don't, don't people have the right to know?"
"01:45:08,587","01:45:13,010","Panic won't help. We just have to keep working, same as ever."
"01:45:13,081","01:45:16,300","Yes, but isn't that exactly what Professor Brand was manipulating..."
"01:45:16,408","01:45:19,723",-Brand gave up on us. I'm still trying to solve this.
"01:45:20,381","01:45:24,245","So, do you have an idea?"
"01:45:25,431","01:45:26,906",A feeling.
"01:45:29,427","01:45:31,849",I told you about my ghost.
"01:45:33,404","01:45:37,952",My dad thought I called it a ghost because I was scared of it.
"01:45:42,020","01:45:43,491",But I was never scared of it.
"01:45:44,467","01:45:52,205","I called it a ghost because it felt....like a person,"
"01:45:53,969","01:45:56,814",that was trying to tell me something.
"01:45:58,980","01:46:02,184","If there is an answer here on Earth, it's back there,"
"01:46:02,256","01:46:06,502",somehow in that room. So I have to find it.
"01:46:09,890","01:46:11,978",We're running out of time.
"01:46:13,024","01:46:16,154",What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?
"01:46:16,261","01:46:19,922",They can stay CASE. I'll be sleeping most of the way anyway. -Hey Coop. -Yeah?
"01:46:20,030","01:46:23,474",I had a suggestion for your return journey. -What is that?
"01:46:23,583","01:46:25,459",Have one last crack at the black hole.
"01:46:26,767","01:46:30,269",I'm going home Rom. -Yeah I know.
"01:46:30,376","01:46:35,033",This isn't gonna cost you any time. It's a chance for the people on Earth.
"01:46:35,111","01:46:38,877",Talk to me. -Gargantua is an older spinning black hole.
"01:46:38,985","01:46:42,200",It is what we call a 'gentle' singularity. -Gentle?
"01:46:42,322","01:46:46,718",They're hardly gentle. But the tidal gravity is so quick that something...
"01:46:46,825","01:46:51,105","...crossing the horizon fast, might survive. A probe say."
"01:46:51,177","01:46:52,657",What happens after it crosses?
"01:46:52,736","01:46:55,618","After, the horizon, is a complete mystery."
"01:46:55,691","01:46:58,487","So, what's to say that there isn't some way that the probe can..."
"01:46:58,488","01:47:01,412",...glimpse the singularity and relay the quantum data?
"01:47:01,542","01:47:05,564",If he's equipped to transmit every form of energy that can pulse...
"01:47:05,653","01:47:10,508",Just when did this probe become a 'he' professor? -TARS is the obvious candidate.
"01:47:10,620","01:47:13,225",I've already told him what to look for.
"01:47:13,341","01:47:17,555","I'll need the old optical transmitter on KIPP, Cooper. -You would do this for us?"
"01:47:17,663","01:47:20,504","Before you get all teary, try to remember that as a robot..."
"01:47:20,578","01:47:24,190",...I have to do anything you say. -Your cue light's blinking.
"01:47:24,264","01:47:25,680",I'm not joking!
"01:47:27,304","01:47:32,029",I'm gonna need TARS to remove and adapt some components from KIPP.
"01:47:32,099","01:47:35,682","Well, I don't wanna disturb his archival functions. -I'll supervise."
"01:47:35,792","01:47:39,971","Alright. -Dr. Mann, we need to find 3 secure sites."
"01:47:40,051","01:47:42,314",One for Brand's lab and 2 for habitat.
"01:47:42,428","01:47:44,977","Once those modules have landed, you don't wanna move."
"01:47:45,077","01:47:47,234","Well I can take you to the probes sites, but I don't think this..."
"01:47:47,349","01:47:50,263",...these conditions are gonna hold. I think we should wait.
"01:47:50,374","01:47:53,256",CASE is headed back down with the rest of the distillery equipment.
"01:47:53,339","01:47:55,927",I would really like to secure those sites by nightfall.
"01:47:57,480","01:48:01,437","Well, these squalls do usually blow over."
"01:48:01,515","01:48:04,609",Okay then. -You're gonna have to take a long-range transmitter.
"01:48:04,723","01:48:06,499",Right. -Are you charged? -Yeah.
"01:48:06,581","01:48:07,995",Follow me.
"01:48:08,100","01:48:12,804","TARS, 72 hours yeah? -Roger that Cooper."
"01:48:18,979","01:48:22,033",Brand told me why you feel you've got to go back.
"01:48:22,847","01:48:27,625",But I'd be remiss if didn't at least mention that a mission...
"01:48:27,697","01:48:30,862",...such as ours could certainly do with an extra engineer.
"01:48:32,322","01:48:34,666",Oh you better slow down turbo.
"01:48:34,778","01:48:39,717","Safety first CASE, do not forget. -Safety first Cooper."
"01:48:39,795","01:48:44,256",I have to tell you Dr. Mann I'm honored to be a part of this.
"01:48:44,369","01:48:46,527",But once we set up base camp and...
"01:48:46,641","01:48:50,992","...secure those modules, my work is done here. I'm going home."
"01:48:53,290","01:48:55,955",
"01:48:09,829","01:48:11,556",We have attachments.
"01:49:00,632","01:49:04,918","But even without a family, I can, promise you that, that yearning..."
"01:49:05,024","01:49:07,505",...to be with other people is remarkable.
"01:49:07,538","01:49:13,581","That emotion is, at the foundation, of what makes us human."
"01:49:13,710","01:49:14,781",
"01:48:33,266","01:48:36,925",How long have you had that cough? -For a while.
"01:49:35,857","01:49:38,156",Mom let's me play in here.
"01:49:38,698","01:49:41,034",I don't touch your stuff.
"01:50:11,500","01:50:13,733",Just take this gently.
"01:50:19,161","01:50:22,619","You know why we couldn't just send machines on these missions, don't you Cooper?"
"01:50:22,733","01:50:27,709","A machine doesn't improvise well, because you can't programme the fear of death."
"01:50:27,781","01:50:32,345",Our survival instinct is our single greatest source of inspiration.
"01:50:32,455","01:50:34,447","Take you for example,"
"01:50:35,341","01:50:40,499","A father, with a survival instinct that extends to your kids."
"01:50:40,622","01:50:45,965","What does research tell us, is the last thing you're gonna see, before you die?"
"01:50:47,408","01:50:50,798",Your children. Their faces.
"01:50:50,875","01:50:54,976","At the moment of death, your mind is going to push you a little bit harder, to survive."
"01:50:55,057","01:50:58,642",For them.
"01:51:00,737","01:51:04,759","Hey, I bet you're Coop. Why don't you have a seat here for me."
"01:51:04,886","01:51:07,328",It's bad. They cannot stay here.
"01:51:07,687","01:51:09,462",OK? -Yes.
"01:51:17,230","01:51:21,881","TARS, what's taking so long? -Professor, I'm having trouble completing the boot-up."
"01:51:21,992","01:51:23,782",I don't understand?
"01:51:30,562","01:51:31,755",It's funny.
"01:51:33,727","01:51:38,790","When I left Earth, I thought I was prepared to die."
"01:51:39,764","01:51:47,044","The truth is, I never really, considered..."
"01:51:47,158","01:51:49,455",...the possibility that my planet wasn't the one.
"01:51:51,567","01:51:55,659",Nothing turns out the way it's supposed to be. -Let's go.
"01:52:01,313","01:52:03,891",Aaaaaaaaaaaah!!
"01:52:12,002","01:52:14,218",What is this? -What are you doing??
"01:52:14,330","01:52:17,683","I'm sorry, I can't let you leave with that ship."
"01:52:17,765","01:52:20,420",We're going to need it to complete the mission.
"01:52:20,530","01:52:25,527","Once the others, realize what this place isn't. We cannot survive here."
"01:52:25,604","01:52:27,993",I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
"01:52:37,981","01:52:39,299",They can't stay here anymore.
"01:52:39,373","01:52:42,995","You have to leave, right now. Hey buddy, let me make something abundantly clear..."
"01:52:43,071","01:52:45,837",You have a responsibility. -Shit.
"01:52:45,949","01:52:48,543","Coop, get her stuff, she's goin' home."
"01:52:48,653","01:52:50,723",-Dad didn't raise you to be this dumb Tom!
"01:52:50,802","01:52:53,099","Dad didn't raise me, grandpa did, and he's buried..."
"01:52:53,100","01:52:54,614",...out back with mom and Jesse.
"01:52:54,649","01:53:04,103",All the data?
"01:53:06,177","01:53:11,009",No. I tried to do my duty Cooper.
"01:53:11,119","01:53:15,932","But I knew, the day that I arrived here, this place had nothing..."
"01:53:16,008","01:53:20,289","...and I resisted the temptation, for years"
"01:53:20,364","01:53:28,320","But, I knew that, if I just pressed that button, then, somebody would come and save me."
"01:53:29,446","01:53:32,825",You fucking coward! -Yes.
"01:53:37,806","01:53:39,208",Yes.
"01:53:40,582","01:53:42,129",Yes.
"01:53:43,135","01:53:44,069",Yes.
"01:53:55,932","01:54:00,685","Listen, if you're not gonna go, let your family go. Just let,...save your family."
"01:54:00,717","01:54:05,574",And go to live underground? With you? Pray that daddy comes to save us?
"01:54:05,644","01:54:09,569",Dad's not coming back. He never was coming back. It's upto me!
"01:54:09,613","01:54:14,477",Are you going to save everybody? Because dad couldn't do it?. -DAD DIDN'T EVEN TRY!!
"01:54:14,597","01:54:16,293",Dad just abandoned us!!
"01:54:17,483","01:54:21,733",He left us here to die. -Nobody is going with you.
"01:54:25,618","01:54:27,822",You're gonna wait for your next kid to die?
"01:54:30,851","01:54:34,745","Get out, and don't come back!"
"01:54:39,510","01:54:41,352",Do what you want with those things.
"01:54:52,037","01:54:53,740",Stop it!
"01:54:55,510","01:54:58,061",No. NO!
"01:54:58,998","01:55:02,347",Dr. Mann there's a 50-50 chance that you're gonna kill yourselves.
"01:55:02,420","01:55:05,156",Those are the best odds I've had in years!
"01:55:25,209","01:55:30,041",Don't judge me Cooper. You were never tested like I was.
"01:55:30,486","01:55:32,414",Few men have been.
"01:55:40,704","01:55:42,400",You tried your best Murph.
"01:55:51,209","01:55:53,123",Do you feel it?
"01:55:54,133","01:55:56,431",The survival instinct.
"01:55:57,336","01:56:02,011","That's what drove me. It's what drives all of us, and it's what's gonna save us."
"01:56:02,087","01:56:05,843",Because I want to save all of us. For you Cooper.
"01:56:10,963","01:56:14,979","I'm sorry, I can't, I can't watch you go through this. I'm sorry."
"01:56:15,055","01:56:17,324","I thought I could, but I can't."
"01:56:18,589","01:56:21,054","I'm here, I'm here for you."
"01:56:21,161","01:56:24,953","Just listen to my voice Cooper, I'm right here."
"01:56:26,078","01:56:28,709",You're not alone.
"01:56:37,600","01:56:40,049",Do you see your children?
"01:56:42,537","01:56:46,661",It's okay. They are right there with you.
"01:56:50,522","01:56:53,802",Did Professor Brand tell you that poem before you left?
"01:56:53,912","01:56:55,606",Do you remember?
"01:56:56,833","01:57:01,300","'Do not go gentle, into that good night'"
"01:57:01,413","01:57:07,129","'Old age should burn, and rave at close of day.'"
"01:57:08,470","01:57:11,821","'Rage, rage against the dying of the light.'"
"01:57:36,233","01:57:39,127",Help! Help! -Cooper?
"01:57:46,045","01:57:48,864",CASE! -Brand.
"01:57:49,818","01:57:50,694",No air!
"01:57:52,726","01:57:56,174",Cooper. Cooper I'm coming. CASE! -I have a fix.
"01:57:56,256","01:57:58,590","Go, go, go!!"
"01:58:10,341","01:58:13,178","Cooper we're coming, hang in there, don't talk!"
"01:58:13,251","01:58:15,762",Breathe as little as possible. We're almost there!
"01:58:18,774","01:58:21,244","There is a security lockout sir, it requires..."
"01:58:21,326","01:58:24,017",...a person to access the functions.
"01:58:28,530","01:58:31,784",It's all yours sir.
"01:58:38,523","01:58:43,049",
"01:58:43,161","01:58:48,056",
"01:57:59,163","01:58:00,082",Cooper!!
"01:58:52,788","01:58:55,163",Come on!
"01:59:01,387","01:59:05,816",I see him! I see him! To the right. Bank right!
"01:59:23,848","01:59:27,107","Cooper! Cooper, I'm here."
"01:59:32,653","01:59:33,672",Take this!
"01:59:41,514","01:59:43,203",Joey bring the tankers!
"01:59:49,785","01:59:52,122",This data makes no sense.
"01:59:59,742","02:00:03,275",I'm sorry. -What?
"02:00:03,390","02:00:05,233","Mann, was lying!"
"02:00:11,822","02:00:14,890",
"01:59:26,014","01:59:28,927",Romilly!
"02:00:18,036","02:00:21,324","Romilly, do you read me? Romilly!!"
"02:00:21,433","02:00:23,207",STEP BACK PROFESSOR!! STEP BACK!!
"02:00:30,572","02:00:33,849",Romilly. -Romilly! Do you read me?!!
"02:00:36,203","02:00:37,821",Keep watch!
"02:00:38,973","02:00:42,598",Lois! -What happened to caution CASE?
"02:00:42,676","02:00:44,041",Safety first Cooper.
"02:00:44,119","02:00:47,860","Romilly, Romilly do you read me? This is Brand."
"02:00:50,627","02:00:54,680","Romilly! -Dr. Brand, Cooper, there's been an explosion."
"02:00:54,794","02:00:56,728",Dr. Mann's compound.
"02:01:24,800","02:01:26,562","TARS, TARS! 10 o'clock."
"02:01:33,045","02:01:35,006",Tell me when TARS is aboard.
"02:01:38,571","02:01:40,336",Romilly did not survive.
"02:01:41,563","02:01:45,448",I could not save him. -TARS is in. -I'll take it from here!
"02:01:45,559","02:01:47,945",D'you have a fix on the Ranger? -He is pushing into orbit.
"02:01:48,058","02:01:51,272","Ah, if he takes control of that ship we're dead."
"02:01:52,503","02:01:55,751",He'd maroon us? -He is marooning us!
"02:01:57,084","02:02:00,677",Get downstairs. Go wait by the car.
"02:02:07,397","02:02:11,277",Come on. Get in the back!
"02:02:11,346","02:02:12,358","Get in the back seat, now!!"
"02:02:17,537","02:02:22,222",Dr. Mann please respond! Dr. Mann please respond!!
"02:02:22,336","02:02:26,333",He doesn't know the Endurance's docking procedure. -But the autopilot does.
"02:02:26,446","02:02:30,220",Not since TARS disabled it! -Nice!
"02:02:30,293","02:02:33,104",What is your trust setting TARS? -Lower than yours apparently!
"02:02:37,955","02:02:41,024","Do not attempt docking, I repeat do not attempt docking."
"02:03:40,375","02:03:43,111",Auto docking sequence withheld.
"02:03:43,148","02:03:47,461",Override. -Unauthorized. -Override!
"02:03:47,537","02:03:49,665",Unauthorized.
"02:03:54,076","02:03:58,717","Do not attempt docking, I repeat Do Not! attempt docking! Please resp..."
"02:04:42,250","02:04:44,163",Moving slowly towards the Endurance.
"02:05:08,451","02:05:12,791",Imperfect contact. -Override! -Hatch locked.
"02:05:20,230","02:05:22,649",Has he locked on yet? -Imperfectly.
"02:05:24,683","02:05:26,368",Dr. Mann...
"02:05:47,024","02:05:49,978",Hatch lockout disengaged.
"02:05:58,899","02:06:02,785","Dr. Mann, do not, I repeat, do not open the hatch."
"02:06:02,858","02:06:07,628","I repeat, do not open the hatch. If you open the hatch, the airlock will depressurize."
"02:06:33,072","02:06:36,087",What happens if he blows the airlock? -Nothing good.
"02:06:41,841","02:06:46,128","Okay, pull back, pull back. Retro thrusters full move back CASE! -Maximum. -Back!"
"02:06:46,381","02:06:49,151",CASE relay my message to the onboard computer...
"02:06:49,265","02:06:50,769",...and have it rebroadcast as emergency PA.
"02:06:50,804","02:06:56,687","Dr. Mann, do not open the air hatch."
"02:06:56,796","02:06:59,098","I repeat, do not... -Brand?"
"02:06:59,170","02:07:04,141",I don't know what he said to you? But I'm taking command of the Endurance.
"02:07:04,217","02:07:06,993",And then we're gonna talk about completing the mission.
"02:07:09,512","02:07:12,352","Dr. Mann, listen to me!"
"02:07:12,430","02:07:16,315","This is not about my life, or Cooper's life,"
"02:07:16,422","02:07:18,194",This is about all mankind.
"02:07:19,283","02:07:20,313",There is a moment...
"02:07:27,081","02:07:28,121",It is not...
"02:07:36,259","02:07:37,945","Oh, my God."
"02:07:55,853","02:08:01,597",Cooper there's no point in using your fuel... -Analyze the Endurance's spin.
"02:08:05,674","02:08:08,481","-Cooper, what are you doing? -Docking."
"02:08:11,353","02:08:14,530","Computer says rotation at 67, 68 rpm."
"02:08:14,603","02:08:18,747",Get ready to match our spin with the retro thrusters. -It's not possible.
"02:08:18,829","02:08:20,875","-No, it's necessary."
"02:08:31,953","02:08:34,651",The Endurance is entering the atmosphere.
"02:08:38,879","02:08:40,503",It does not have a heat shield.
"02:08:42,953","02:08:45,610","CASE, you ready? -Ready."
"02:08:53,979","02:08:56,798","Cooper, this is no time for caution."
"02:08:58,565","02:09:00,581","CASE, if I pass out, you take the stick."
"02:09:00,693","02:09:04,182","TARS, get ready to engage the docking mechanism."
"02:09:10,571","02:09:14,011",The Endurance is starting to heat. -20 feet out.
"02:09:14,093","02:09:17,940",I need three degrees starboard Cooper. -10 feet out.
"02:09:18,049","02:09:21,581","Cooper, we are, lined up!"
"02:09:21,697","02:09:23,093",Initiate spin!
"02:10:04,997","02:10:06,286",Hold on TARS!
"02:10:14,099","02:10:15,390",HOLD ON!
"02:10:25,858","02:10:29,323",We're locked Cooper. -EASING UP!
"02:10:36,567","02:10:38,665",Slowly.
"02:10:39,692","02:10:40,945",Slowly.
"02:10:46,219","02:10:48,160",Retro thrusters!
"02:10:55,663","02:10:57,948",Main engines on!
"02:11:03,061","02:11:06,545",We're getting out of orbit. Come on baby!
"02:11:14,121","02:11:15,747",Shutting engines.
"02:11:16,825","02:11:18,813",Okay we're out of orbit!
"02:11:26,379","02:11:29,616",Okay! And for our next trick!
"02:11:30,554","02:11:34,703",It better be good. We're headed into Gargantua's pull.
"02:11:35,670","02:11:39,213",Shit. CASE take the stick. -Roger that.
"02:12:28,345","02:12:31,253","Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua."
"02:12:31,401","02:12:33,924",Shall I use the engines?
"02:12:34,036","02:12:38,348","No, we gotta let her slide as far as we can!"
"02:12:47,609","02:12:50,433",Give it to me. -It's good news and bad news Cooper.
"02:12:50,543","02:12:54,433","Yeah, to hell with it TARS! Just give it to me straight."
"02:13:02,067","02:13:06,104","The back-up generator kicked in, so the system's stable. They're all good."
"02:13:07,274","02:13:11,491",Good! Okay. The navigational hub's been completely destroyed.
"02:13:11,599","02:13:14,216","We don't have enough life support to make it back to Earth,"
"02:13:14,291","02:13:18,229",but I think we can scratch over to Edmund's planet. -What about fuel?
"02:13:18,339","02:13:21,042",It's not enough. But I have a plan.
"02:13:21,081","02:13:24,595","We let, Gargantua, pull us down close..."
"02:13:24,598","02:13:27,729","to the horizon, and a powered slingshot..."
"02:13:27,848","02:13:30,503",...around launching us towards Edmund's planet. -Manually?
"02:13:30,615","02:13:34,282",That's what I'm here for. I'll take us just inside the critical orbit.
"02:13:34,357","02:13:35,865",What about the time slippage?
"02:13:35,979","02:13:39,472",Neither one of us have time to worry about relativity right now Dr. Brand.
"02:13:44,075","02:13:45,063",Sorry Cooper.
"02:13:47,300","02:13:50,330",Once we have gathered enough speed...
"02:13:50,402","02:13:53,454","...around Gargantua, we use Lander 1,"
"02:13:53,953","02:13:56,590",and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters...
"02:13:56,847","02:13:59,512",...to push us out of the black hole's gravity
"02:14:01,064","02:14:03,904","The Lander's linkages have been destroyed,"
"02:14:03,981","02:14:06,970",so we're going to have to control it manually.
"02:14:08,447","02:14:11,725","Once Lander 1 is spent, TARS will detach..."
"02:14:11,834","02:14:16,052",...and get sucked right into that black hole! -Why does TARS have to detach?
"02:14:16,163","02:14:20,651","We have to shed the weight, escape gravity. -Newton's third law."
"02:14:20,727","02:14:24,603",The only way humans have figured out of getting somewhere is to leave something behind.
"02:14:24,759","02:14:29,661","Cooper, you can't ask TARS to do this for us. -He's a robot..."
"02:14:29,776","02:14:33,871","...so you don't have to ask him to do anything. -Cooper, you asshole!"
"02:14:33,943","02:14:38,320","Sorry, you broke up a little bit there. -It's what we intended Dr. Brand."
"02:14:38,337","02:14:41,287","It's our only chance to save people on Earth,"
"02:14:41,364","02:14:46,126","if I can find a way to transmit the quantum data I'll find in there, maybe they'll make it."
"02:14:47,714","02:14:50,051",Let's just hope there is still someone there to save.
"02:15:18,609","02:15:20,460",Maximum velocity achieved.
"02:15:20,536","02:15:25,376",Prepare to fire speed thrusters.
"02:15:25,449","02:15:27,985",Ready? -Ready. -Ready.
"02:15:28,071","02:15:34,286","Main engine ignition in 3, 2, 1..."
"02:15:49,974","02:15:52,072","Engines of Lander 1 on my command,"
"02:15:52,983","02:15:57,928","3, 2, 1..."
"02:16:02,192","02:16:05,321","Engines of Ranger 2 on my command,"

"02:16:19,179","02:16:23,136",This little maneuver is gonna cost us 51 years!!
"02:16:23,214","02:16:26,528",You're not too bad for someone pushing 120!
"02:16:41,641","02:16:44,815","Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark,"
"02:16:44,925","02:16:50,748","3, 2, 1..."
"02:16:50,820","02:16:51,874",Detach!
"02:16:54,779","02:16:59,347",Goodbye TARS! -Goodbye Dr. Brand. See you on the other side Coop.
"02:16:59,424","02:17:00,768",See you there slick!
"02:17:09,301","02:17:12,754",Okay CASE. Nice reckless flying!
"02:17:12,869","02:17:15,333",Learned from the master!
"02:17:15,414","02:17:17,921","Ranger 2, prepare for detachment."
"02:17:18,004","02:17:21,683","-What, no, no! Cooper, Cooper, what are you doing??"
"02:17:21,791","02:17:25,060",Newton's third law. You gotta leave something behind!
"02:17:25,429","02:17:29,838","You said we had enough resources for both of us! -We agreed Amelia,"
"02:17:29,873","02:17:32,405",90%
"02:17:32,518","02:17:34,680",No!
"02:17:35,959","02:17:38,130",Detach.
"02:17:51,513","02:17:53,939","Okay, we're nosing down."
"02:17:57,419","02:17:59,650",Approaching the event horizon.
"02:18:00,843","02:18:12,948","Portside, dipping down beneath it..., to go through it. Heading towards... blackness... <I have a visual of the event!>"
"02:18:13,172","02:18:15,044",It's all black!
"02:18:17,385","02:18:21,463","TARS, do you read me? It's all black."
"02:18:22,261","02:18:25,122","TARS, do you read me? Over."
"02:18:29,740","02:18:36,070","We're...we're getting screens, We're getting interference."
"02:18:37,914","02:18:39,177",Losing control of the stick.
"02:18:39,281","02:18:43,204",We've got flashes. Flashes of lightness and blackness.
"02:18:43,279","02:18:47,983",There's a turbulence in the gravity.
"02:18:52,666","02:18:55,586",Computers going down.

"02:26:49,607","02:26:51,041",Roger that.
"02:26:52,414","02:26:55,608",You survived? -Somewhere...
"02:26:55,725","02:26:59,935",...in their fifth dimension. They saved us!
"02:27:00,052","02:27:03,576",Yeah? Well who the hell is 'They'?
"02:27:03,687","02:27:05,813",And just why would they want to help us?
"02:27:05,894","02:27:08,979","I don't know, but they constructed this three-dimensional space..."
"02:27:08,980","02:27:13,716",...inside their five dimensional reality to allow you to understand it. -Yeah well it ain't working.
"02:27:13,792","02:27:19,909","Yes it is. You've seen that time, is represented as a physical dimension."
"02:27:20,029","02:27:24,585",You've worked out that you can exert a force across spacetime. -Gravity...
"02:27:25,629","02:27:28,246",...to send a message? -Affirmative.
"02:27:30,187","02:27:32,157",Gravity...
"02:27:32,273","02:27:36,731","...can cross the dimensions, including time?"
"02:27:37,006","02:27:38,268",-Apparently.
"02:27:42,056","02:27:45,974","Do you have the quantum data? -Roger, I have it."
"02:27:46,084","02:27:49,421",I've translated it on all wavelengths...
"02:27:49,422","02:27:53,583","...but nothing is getting out Cooper. -I can do this, I can."
"02:27:53,632","02:27:58,266",But such complicated data to a child? -Not just any child.
"02:28:00,106","02:28:01,937",Come on dad!
"02:28:05,040","02:28:06,736","Murph, the fire's out! Come on!"
"02:28:06,807","02:28:10,498","Even though you communicate it here, she won't understand it's significance for years!"

"02:28:15,642","02:28:18,273","...or the people on Earth are gonna die! Think, think, think!"
"02:28:18,546","02:28:22,152","Cooper, they didn't bring us here to change the past."
"02:28:25,818","02:28:30,717","Say that again. -They didn't bring us here, to change the past."
"02:28:34,929","02:28:37,737","No, they didn't bring us here at all."
"02:28:42,860","02:28:43,812",We brought ourselves!
"02:28:52,975","02:28:57,385","TARS, give me the coordinates for NASA, in binary."
"02:28:57,512","02:28:59,843","In binary, roger, translating data."
"02:29:23,544","02:29:26,316",It's not a ghost.
"02:29:27,254","02:29:31,761",It's gravity. -Don't you get it yet TARS?
"02:29:31,874","02:29:33,714",I brought myself here!
"02:29:34,211","02:29:38,161","We're here to communicate, with the three dimensional world!"
"02:29:38,698","02:29:39,998",We are the bridge!
"02:29:47,177","02:29:50,272",I thought they chose me.
"02:29:52,900","02:29:56,908","But they didn't choose me, they chose her! -For what Cooper?"
"02:29:59,402","02:30:01,021",To save the world!
"02:30:05,058","02:30:09,185","All of this! In one, little girl's bedroom."
"02:30:09,297","02:30:11,719","Every moment, it's infinitely complex."
"02:30:11,826","02:30:14,819",They have access to infinite time and space...
"02:30:14,820","02:30:16,448",...but they're not bound by anything!
"02:30:16,577","02:30:21,327","They can't find, a specific place in time. They can't communicate."
"02:30:21,443","02:30:25,100",That's why I'm here. -I'm here to find a way...
"02:30:25,124","02:30:28,256","...to tell Murph, just like I found this moment. -How Cooper?"
"02:30:28,372","02:30:29,928","Love TARS, love!"
"02:30:30,040","02:30:33,634","It's just like Brand said, my connection with Murph, it is quantifiable."
"02:30:33,742","02:30:36,245",It is the key. -Why are we here?
"02:30:37,440","02:30:39,342",To find out how to tell.
"02:30:41,859","02:30:43,621",The watch!
"02:30:46,655","02:30:50,319",The watch!
"02:30:52,555","02:30:55,714",Encode the data in the movement of the second hand.
"02:30:59,139","02:31:03,135","TARS, translate the data into Morse and give it to me."
"02:31:03,208","02:31:06,565","Translating the data to Morse. Cooper, what if she never came back for it?"
"02:31:07,903","02:31:11,533",She will. She will.
"02:31:13,153","02:31:16,935",He's coming Murph!
"02:31:18,052","02:31:23,030","Okay, coming down! -How do you know?"
"02:31:26,489","02:31:28,255",Because I gave it to her!
"02:31:32,902","02:31:36,360","Roger Morse is dot dot dash dot,"
"02:31:39,206","02:31:44,093","Dot, dot, dash, dot,"

"02:32:15,108","02:32:18,418",All the time!! I knew it!!!
"02:32:18,504","02:32:20,687",Dad saved us!!
"02:32:59,146","02:33:00,357",
"02:32:14,946","02:32:17,570",Eureka!!!
"02:33:09,022","02:33:10,930",It's traditional.
"02:33:15,042","02:33:16,805",Eureka!!!
"02:33:21,559","02:33:24,955",Did it work? -I think it might have.
"02:33:26,325","02:33:27,981",How do you know?
"02:33:28,061","02:33:31,505","Because, the bulk beings are closing the Tesseract."
"02:33:35,333","02:33:37,345",Don't you get it yet TARS?
"02:33:37,418","02:33:40,729",They're not beings.
"02:33:40,805","02:33:42,495",They're us!
"02:33:44,009","02:33:47,781","What I've been doing for Murph, they've been doing for me!"
"02:33:47,896","02:33:51,775","For all of us. -Cooper, people couldn't build this."
"02:33:51,851","02:33:56,388","No, no. Not yet. But one day."
"02:33:56,539","02:34:00,416",Not you and me. But people.
"02:34:00,488","02:34:06,138",A civilization that's evolved past the 4 dimensions that we know.
"02:34:11,693","02:34:12,805",What happens now?
"02:35:15,773","02:35:16,638",Mr. Cooper.
"02:35:21,281","02:35:25,069",Let's take it slow sir. Nice and easy Mr. Cooper.
"02:35:25,181","02:35:27,949",Remember you're no spring chicken anymore.
"02:35:28,059","02:35:30,502",Actually you are one hundred and twenty four years old.
"02:35:37,539","02:35:39,155",Take it slow sir.
"02:35:40,614","02:35:42,128","You were, um, extremely lucky."
"02:35:42,236","02:35:46,513",The Rangers found you with only minutes left in your oxygen supply.
"02:35:58,516","02:36:01,290",Where am I?
"02:36:03,204","02:36:04,787",Cooper station.
"02:36:06,050","02:36:07,713",Currently orbiting Saturn.
"02:36:08,947","02:36:11,690",Cooper station?
"02:36:14,448","02:36:16,887",What nice of you to name it after me!
"02:36:19,942","02:36:23,526","What? -Well, the station isn't named after you sir,"
"02:36:23,640","02:36:25,100","It's uh, it's named after your daughter."
"02:36:25,115","02:36:29,539",Although she's always maintained just how important you were. -Is she still alive?
"02:36:29,613","02:36:33,477",She'll be here in a couple of weeks.
"02:36:34,567","02:36:37,817",She is far too old to be transferred from another station...
"02:36:37,891","02:36:40,122",...but when she heard that you'd been found.
"02:36:40,229","02:36:43,756","Well this is, this is Murphy Cooper we're talking about!"
"02:36:43,867","02:36:45,741",Yes it is!
"02:36:48,222","02:36:50,244",We'll have you checked out of here in a couple of days.
"02:36:53,301","02:36:55,869",I'm sure you'll be excited to see what's in store.
"02:36:56,522","02:37:01,396","I actually uhh, did a paper on you, in high school,"
"02:37:01,504","02:37:03,132",I know all about your life back on Earth.
"02:37:04,931","02:37:07,632","Oh yeah, right."
"02:37:09,004","02:37:15,365","Sir, if you could follow me? You've got a really good situation."
"02:37:19,147","02:37:22,537","So um, when I made my suggestion to Ms. Cooper,"
"02:37:23,873","02:37:26,817",I was delighted to hear that she thought it was perfect.
"02:37:33,438","02:37:37,200","Well of course, I didn't speak to her in person."
"02:37:41,429","02:37:46,313",My dad was a farmer. Like everybody else back then.
"02:37:46,422","02:37:49,641","Anyway, there just wasn't enough food."
"02:37:49,753","02:37:55,727",We had strips of sheet to cover our nose and mouth.
"02:37:56,021","02:37:58,284",So we wouldn't breathe so much of it.
"02:37:58,358","02:38:01,302",
"02:37:12,412","02:37:16,944",
"02:37:17,025","02:37:19,677","She did confirm, just how much you loved farming."
"02:38:08,758","02:38:11,141",She did? Did she?
"02:38:11,215","02:38:14,529","Well, home sweet home!"
"02:38:14,601","02:38:18,229",Everything is in its place and faithfully reproduced.
"02:38:18,310","02:38:19,695",Yes.
"02:38:24,244","02:38:29,517","Hey, is this? -Oh yeah, the machine we found out near Saturn with you."
"02:38:29,630","02:38:32,994","It's power source is shot, but we can get another one if you want."
"02:38:33,103","02:38:34,863","Yes, please!"

"02:39:06,514","02:39:09,317",60% confirmed.
"02:39:09,390","02:39:13,138",Knock Knock. -You want 55?
"02:39:17,503","02:39:19,503",Is this really what it was like?
"02:39:21,845","02:39:24,549",It was never this clean slick.
"02:39:29,270","02:39:33,793","I don't care much for this, pretending we are back where we started."
"02:39:34,622","02:39:36,853",I want to know where we are?
"02:39:37,978","02:39:40,309",Where are we going?
"02:39:45,183","02:39:47,645",Mr Cooper. -Yes? -The family is all in there.
"02:39:47,802","02:39:49,433",Family?
"02:39:49,544","02:39:53,392","Yeah, they all came out to see her. She's been in cryo sleep for almost 2 years."
"02:40:26,034","02:40:28,800",You told them I liked farming?
"02:40:34,241","02:40:35,393",It was me Murph!
"02:40:37,839","02:40:40,250",I was your ghost!
"02:40:41,300","02:40:42,774",I know.
"02:40:44,901","02:40:50,545","People didn't believe me, they thought I was doing it all myself. But..."
"02:40:53,721","02:40:56,134",...I knew who it was.
"02:41:00,277","02:41:02,368",Nobody believed me.
"02:41:02,487","02:41:05,431",But I knew you'd come back.
"02:41:07,234","02:41:08,849",How?
"02:41:10,190","02:41:14,150",Because my dad promised me!
"02:41:20,540","02:41:24,642",I'm here now Murph. I'm here!
"02:41:26,450","02:41:33,894",No. No parent should have to watch their own child die.
"02:41:36,028","02:41:40,166",I have my kids here for me now.
"02:41:42,436","02:41:44,505",You go!
"02:41:47,058","02:41:47,994",Where?
"02:41:51,352","02:41:53,479",Brand.
"02:42:02,505","02:42:05,299","She's, out there."
"02:42:09,863","02:42:12,829",Setting up camp.
"02:42:39,381","02:42:44,814","Alone, in a strange galaxy."
"02:42:55,554","02:42:59,023","Maybe right now she's, settling in..."
"02:42:59,058","02:43:01,378",...for the long nap.
"02:43:17,324","02:43:21,753",By the light of our new sun.
"02:43:36,669","02:43:39,369",In our new home.
"02:43:42,369","02:43:46,369",
