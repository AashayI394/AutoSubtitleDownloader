Inception,"00:01:33,452","00:01:38,459",He was delirious. But asked for you by name.
Inception,"00:01:40,458","00:01:42,058",Show him.
Inception,"00:01:43,357","00:01:46,059",He was carrying nothing but this....
Inception,"00:01:47,462","00:01:49,062",... and this.
Inception,"00:02:10,104","00:02:12,834",Are you here to kill me?
Inception,"00:02:20,514","00:02:23,005",I know what this is.
Inception,"00:02:24,085","00:02:29,250","I've seen one before. Many, many years ago."
Inception,"00:02:30,858","00:02:35,761",It belonged to a man I met in a half-remembered dream.
Inception,"00:02:37,765","00:02:42,862",A man possessed of some radical notions.
Inception,"00:02:46,741","00:02:49,608",What is the most resilient parasite?
Inception,"00:02:49,877","00:02:53,244",A bacteria? A virus?
Inception,"00:02:53,814","00:02:55,076",An intestinal worm?
Inception,"00:02:55,416","00:02:56,644",Uh...
Inception,"00:02:56,817","00:02:58,444",What Mr. Cobb is trying to say-
Inception,"00:02:58,619","00:02:59,813",An idea.
Inception,"00:03:01,122","00:03:03,613",Resilient. Highly contagious.
Inception,"00:03:03,791","00:03:07,784","Once an idea has taken hold of the brain, it's almost impossible to eradicate."
Inception,"00:03:08,229","00:03:12,495","An idea that is fully formed, fully understood, that sticks."
Inception,"00:03:12,667","00:03:13,895",Right in there somewhere.
Inception,"00:03:14,068","00:03:15,626",For someone like you to steal?
Inception,"00:03:15,803","00:03:18,738","Yes. In the dream state, your conscious defenses are lowered..."
Inception,"00:03:18,906","00:03:21,340",...and that makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft.
Inception,"00:03:21,509","00:03:22,737",It's called extraction.
Inception,"00:03:22,910","00:03:26,471","Mr. Saito, we can train your subconscious to defend itself..."
Inception,"00:03:26,647","00:03:29,138",...from even the most skilled extractor.
Inception,"00:03:29,317","00:03:30,477",How can you do that?
Inception,"00:03:30,651","00:03:33,484",Because I am the most skilled extractor.
Inception,"00:03:33,955","00:03:37,356",I know how to search your mind and find your secrets. I know the tricks.
Inception,"00:03:37,525","00:03:40,460","And I can teach them to you, so that even when you're asleep..."
Inception,"00:03:40,628","00:03:42,960",...your defense is never down.
Inception,"00:03:43,864","00:03:47,766","Look, if you want my help, you're gonna have to be completely open with me."
Inception,"00:03:47,935","00:03:51,302",I need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife...
Inception,"00:03:51,472","00:03:53,770","...better than your therapist, better than anyone."
Inception,"00:03:54,208","00:03:56,870","If this is a dream, and you have a safe full of secrets..."
Inception,"00:03:57,044","00:03:59,376",...I need to know what's in that safe.
Inception,"00:03:59,547","00:04:03,005","In order for this all to work, you need to completely let me in."
Inception,"00:04:05,886","00:04:10,516","Enjoy your evening, gentlemen, as I consider your proposal."
Inception,"00:04:12,994","00:04:14,018",He knows.
Inception,"00:04:17,064","00:04:18,531",What's going on up there?
Inception,"00:05:12,787","00:05:15,381",Saito knows. He's playing with us.
Inception,"00:05:15,790","00:05:18,122",Doesn't matter. I can get it here. Trust me.
Inception,"00:05:18,292","00:05:19,782",The information is in the safe.
Inception,"00:05:19,960","00:05:22,121",He looked right at it when I mentioned secrets.
Inception,"00:05:23,497","00:05:24,521",What's she doing here?
Inception,"00:05:27,468","00:05:30,335",Just head back to the room. All right? I'll take care of this.
Inception,"00:05:30,504","00:05:32,529","Okay, make sure you do. We're here to work."
Inception,"00:05:40,981","00:05:45,645","If I jumped, would I survive?"
Inception,"00:05:48,022","00:05:50,422","With a clean dive, perhaps."
Inception,"00:05:50,591","00:05:52,252","Mal, what are you doing here?"
Inception,"00:05:52,426","00:05:54,621",I thought you might be missing me.
Inception,"00:05:54,929","00:05:56,055",You know that I am.
Inception,"00:05:57,631","00:06:00,099",But I can't trust you anymore.
Inception,"00:06:00,835","00:06:02,200",So what?
Inception,"00:06:03,771","00:06:05,966",Looks like Arthur's taste.
Inception,"00:06:06,140","00:06:09,769","Actually, the subject is partial to postwar British painters."
Inception,"00:06:11,479","00:06:13,174","Please, have a seat."
Inception,"00:06:20,921","00:06:22,354",Tell me...
Inception,"00:06:22,756","00:06:24,314",...do the children miss me?
Inception,"00:06:28,662","00:06:30,357",You can't imagine.
Inception,"00:06:34,535","00:06:35,627",What are you doing?
Inception,"00:06:35,803","00:06:37,327",Just getting some fresh air.
Inception,"00:06:37,738","00:06:39,501","Stay where you are, Mal."
Inception,"00:06:53,220","00:06:55,051",Goddamn it.
Inception,"00:07:56,917","00:07:58,475",Turn around.
Inception,"00:07:58,652","00:07:59,676","The gun, Dom."
Inception,"00:08:08,963","00:08:10,089",Please.
Inception,"00:08:22,209","00:08:24,575","Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb."
Inception,"00:08:24,979","00:08:28,380",Did she tell you? Or have you known all along?
Inception,"00:08:28,816","00:08:33,776","That you're here to steal from me, or that we are actually asleep?"
Inception,"00:08:37,925","00:08:40,291",I want to know the name of your employer.
Inception,"00:08:42,296","00:08:46,164","Ah, there's no use threatening him in a dream, right, Mal?"
Inception,"00:08:46,333","00:08:48,801",That depends on what you're threatening.
Inception,"00:08:49,703","00:08:51,864",Killing him would just wake him up.
Inception,"00:08:52,640","00:08:53,800",But pain...
Inception,"00:08:57,745","00:08:59,645",Pain is in the mind.
Inception,"00:09:00,347","00:09:04,545","And judging by the decor, we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?"
Inception,"00:09:15,963","00:09:19,057",- What are you doing? It's too soon. - But the dream's collapsing.
Inception,"00:09:19,233","00:09:22,669",I'm gonna try to keep Saito under a little bit longer. We're almost there.
Inception,"00:09:36,884","00:09:40,843",He was close. Very close.
Inception,"00:09:55,169","00:09:56,727",Stop him!
Inception,"00:10:22,563","00:10:24,724",This isn't gonna work. Wake him up.
Inception,"00:10:45,552","00:10:47,486",He won't wake.
Inception,"00:10:51,959","00:10:53,256",- Give him the kick. What?
Inception,"00:10:53,794","00:10:54,818",Dunk him.
Inception,"00:11:39,373","00:11:40,738",He's out.
Inception,"00:11:46,046","00:11:48,105","You came prepared, hmm?"
Inception,"00:11:48,282","00:11:52,116",Not even my head of security knows this apartment. How did you find it?
Inception,"00:11:52,753","00:11:56,484",It's difficult for a man of your position to keep a love nest like this secret...
Inception,"00:11:56,657","00:11:59,182",...particularly where there's a married woman involved.
Inception,"00:11:59,359","00:12:01,327",- She would never... - Yet here we are.
Inception,"00:12:02,396","00:12:04,489",- With a dilemma. - They're getting closer.
Inception,"00:12:04,665","00:12:07,429","- You got what you came for. Well, that's not true."
Inception,"00:12:07,601","00:12:10,263","You left out a key piece of information, didn't you?"
Inception,"00:12:10,437","00:12:13,634",You held something back because you knew what we were up to.
Inception,"00:12:13,807","00:12:16,674","- Question is, why'd you let us in at all? - An audition."
Inception,"00:12:17,878","00:12:20,813",- An audition for what? - Doesn't matter. You failed.
Inception,"00:12:20,981","00:12:23,677",We extracted every bit of information you had in there.
Inception,"00:12:24,084","00:12:26,382",But your deception was obvious.
Inception,"00:13:07,261","00:13:11,698","- So leave me and go. - You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito."
Inception,"00:13:11,865","00:13:16,097","That corporation that hired us, they won't accept failure."
Inception,"00:13:16,270","00:13:18,397",We won't last two days.
Inception,"00:13:20,340","00:13:21,534",Cobb?
Inception,"00:13:21,708","00:13:24,836",Looks like I'm gonna have to do this a little more simply.
Inception,"00:13:25,012","00:13:28,778","Tell us what you know! Tell us what you know, now!"
Inception,"00:13:32,152","00:13:35,019",I've always hated this carpet.
Inception,"00:13:35,656","00:13:39,558",It's stained and frayed in such distinctive ways.
Inception,"00:13:41,061","00:13:44,394",But very definitely made of wool.
Inception,"00:13:45,232","00:13:46,927",Right now...
Inception,"00:13:47,968","00:13:50,402",...I'm lying on polyester.
Inception,"00:13:54,274","00:13:59,109","Which means I'm not lying on my carpet, in my apartment."
Inception,"00:13:59,980","00:14:03,245","You have lived up to your reputation, Mr. Cobb."
Inception,"00:14:03,684","00:14:05,709",I'm still dreaming.
Inception,"00:14:12,392","00:14:14,223",- How'd it go? - Not good.
Inception,"00:14:19,633","00:14:23,729","Dream within a dream, huh? I'm impressed."
Inception,"00:14:25,005","00:14:28,497","But in my dream, you play by my rules."
Inception,"00:14:28,675","00:14:30,939","Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito..."
Inception,"00:14:31,111","00:14:32,510",We're not in your dream.
Inception,"00:14:32,679","00:14:34,237",We're in mine.
Inception,"00:14:44,191","00:14:46,284",Asshole. How do you mess up the carpet?
Inception,"00:14:46,460","00:14:48,758",- It wasn't my fault. - You're the architect.
Inception,"00:14:48,929","00:14:51,056",I didn't know he was gonna rub his cheek on it!
Inception,"00:14:51,231","00:14:52,323",That's enough.
Inception,"00:14:53,433","00:14:54,957",You. What the hell was all that?
Inception,"00:14:55,469","00:14:58,336",- I have it under control. - I'd hate to see you out of control.
Inception,"00:14:58,505","00:15:02,271",We don't have time for this. I'm getting off at Kyoto.
Inception,"00:15:02,442","00:15:04,273",He's not gonna check every compartment.
Inception,"00:15:04,444","00:15:06,071","Yeah, well, I don't like trains."
Inception,"00:15:06,246","00:15:09,010",Listen. Every man for himself.
Inception,"00:16:23,356","00:16:24,380","Yes, hello?"
Inception,"00:16:24,591","00:16:27,185","Hi, Daddy. Hi, Dad."
Inception,"00:16:27,728","00:16:31,323","Hey, guys. Hey. How are you? How you doing, huh?"
Inception,"00:16:31,498","00:16:33,728","Good. Okay, I guess."
Inception,"00:16:33,900","00:16:37,631","Okay? Who's just okay? Is that you, James?"
Inception,"00:16:37,804","00:16:41,706","Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad?"
Inception,"00:16:42,709","00:16:47,339","Well, I can't, sweetheart. I can't. Not for a while, remember?"
Inception,"00:16:47,514","00:16:48,845",Why?
Inception,"00:16:49,182","00:16:54,745","Look, I told you, I'm away because I'm working, right?"
Inception,"00:16:55,055","00:16:57,888",Grandma says you're never coming back.
Inception,"00:16:58,558","00:17:00,458","Phillipa, is that you?"
Inception,"00:17:01,428","00:17:03,760","Put Grandma on the phone for me, will you?"
Inception,"00:17:03,930","00:17:05,625",She's shaking her head.
Inception,"00:17:07,768","00:17:10,259","Well, just hope she's wrong about that."
Inception,"00:17:11,138","00:17:12,332",Daddy?
Inception,"00:17:13,039","00:17:14,063","Yeah, James?"
Inception,"00:17:14,241","00:17:15,902",Is Mommy with you?
Inception,"00:17:18,545","00:17:20,740","James, we talked about this."
Inception,"00:17:22,048","00:17:24,380",Mommy's not here anymore.
Inception,"00:17:25,452","00:17:26,680",Where?
Inception,"00:17:28,421","00:17:31,049","That's enough, kids. Say bye-bye."
Inception,"00:17:31,224","00:17:34,250","Listen, I'm gonna send some presents with Grandpa, all right?"
Inception,"00:17:34,427","00:17:35,451","And you be good, you be-"
Inception,"00:17:45,972","00:17:48,167",- Our ride's on the roof. - Right.
Inception,"00:17:55,348","00:17:56,508","Hey, are you okay?"
Inception,"00:17:57,250","00:17:58,547","Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?"
Inception,"00:17:58,718","00:18:01,152","Well, down in the dream, Mal showing up."
Inception,"00:18:01,321","00:18:04,552","Look, I'm, uh, sorry about your leg. Won't happen again."
Inception,"00:18:04,724","00:18:08,319","- It's getting worse, isn't it? - One apology's all you're getting, all right?"
Inception,"00:18:08,495","00:18:10,963",- Where's Nash? - He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?
Inception,"00:18:11,131","00:18:13,599",We were supposed to deliver Saito's expansion plans...
Inception,"00:18:13,767","00:18:15,530",...to Cobol Engineering two hours ago.
Inception,"00:18:15,702","00:18:18,933","By now, they know we failed. It's time we disappear."
Inception,"00:18:19,472","00:18:21,963",- Where you gonna go? - Buenos Aires.
Inception,"00:18:22,142","00:18:26,408","I can lie low there, maybe sniff out a job when things quiet down. You?"
Inception,"00:18:26,580","00:18:27,774",Stateside.
Inception,"00:18:27,981","00:18:29,471",Send my regards.
Inception,"00:18:35,822","00:18:39,383",He sold you out. Thought to come to me and bargain for his life.
Inception,"00:18:41,561","00:18:43,358",So I offer you the satisfaction.
Inception,"00:18:47,300","00:18:49,825",It's not the way I deal with things.
Inception,"00:19:02,115","00:19:04,982",- What will you do with him? - Nothing.
Inception,"00:19:05,385","00:19:07,876",But I can't speak for Cobol Engineering.
Inception,"00:19:22,402","00:19:25,394",- What do you want from us? - Inception.
Inception,"00:19:27,007","00:19:29,407",- Is it possible? - Of course not.
Inception,"00:19:29,576","00:19:31,771",If you can steal an idea from someone's mind...
Inception,"00:19:31,945","00:19:33,810",...why can't you plant one there instead?
Inception,"00:19:33,980","00:19:36,073","Okay, here's me planting an idea in your head."
Inception,"00:19:36,249","00:19:39,548","I say, ""Don't think about elephants."" What are you thinking about?"
Inception,"00:19:39,719","00:19:40,743",Elephants.
Inception,"00:19:40,921","00:19:44,084","Right. But it's not your idea, because you know I gave it to you."
Inception,"00:19:44,291","00:19:47,260",The subject's mind can always trace the genesis of the idea.
Inception,"00:19:47,427","00:19:50,624",- True inspiration's impossible to fake. - That's not true.
Inception,"00:19:53,166","00:19:56,260",- Can you do it? - Are you offering me a choice?
Inception,"00:19:56,436","00:19:59,098",Because I can find my own way to square things with Cobol.
Inception,"00:19:59,272","00:20:01,297",Then you do have a choice.
Inception,"00:20:01,474","00:20:03,237","Then I choose to leave, sir."
Inception,"00:20:08,148","00:20:09,843",Tell the crew where you want to go.
Inception,"00:20:15,121","00:20:16,179","Hey, Mr. Cobb."
Inception,"00:20:19,359","00:20:21,418",How would you like to go home?
Inception,"00:20:22,228","00:20:25,527",To America. To your children.
Inception,"00:20:25,966","00:20:29,299",You can't fix that. No one can.
Inception,"00:20:29,469","00:20:32,700","- Just like inception. - Cobb, come on."
Inception,"00:20:36,443","00:20:39,344",- How complex is the idea? - Simple enough.
Inception,"00:20:39,512","00:20:43,039",No idea is simple when you need to plant it in somebody else's mind.
Inception,"00:20:43,450","00:20:46,942",My main competitor is an old man in poor health.
Inception,"00:20:47,120","00:20:50,886",His son will soon inherit control of the corporation.
Inception,"00:20:51,791","00:20:55,352",I need him to decide to break up his father's empire.
Inception,"00:20:56,062","00:20:58,724","- Cobb, we should walk away from this. - Hold on."
Inception,"00:21:00,800","00:21:04,065","If I were to do this, if I even could do it..."
Inception,"00:21:04,237","00:21:06,137",...I'd need a guarantee.
Inception,"00:21:06,306","00:21:09,571",- How do I know you can deliver? - You don't.
Inception,"00:21:10,176","00:21:11,643",But I can.
Inception,"00:21:12,245","00:21:16,807",So do you want to take a leap of faith...
Inception,"00:21:17,250","00:21:21,084","...or become an old man, filled with regret..."
Inception,"00:21:21,254","00:21:23,848",...waiting to die alone?
Inception,"00:21:26,926","00:21:31,226","Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb. And choose your people more wisely."
Inception,"00:21:39,339","00:21:41,170","Look, I know how much you wanna go home."
Inception,"00:21:43,977","00:21:45,706",This can't be done.
Inception,"00:21:45,879","00:21:49,144","Yes, it can. Just have to go deep enough."
Inception,"00:21:49,349","00:21:50,873",You don't know that.
Inception,"00:21:52,218","00:21:54,049",I've done it before.
Inception,"00:21:55,255","00:21:56,415",Who'd you do it to?
Inception,"00:22:01,661","00:22:03,652",Why are we going to Paris?
Inception,"00:22:05,265","00:22:06,960",We're gonna need a new architect.
Inception,"00:22:23,883","00:22:25,942","You never did like your office, did you?"
Inception,"00:22:27,754","00:22:30,780",No space to think in that broom cupboard.
Inception,"00:22:32,659","00:22:34,889",Is it safe for you to be here?
Inception,"00:22:36,129","00:22:38,529",Extradition between France and the United States...
Inception,"00:22:38,698","00:22:40,928","...is a bureaucratic nightmare, you know that."
Inception,"00:22:41,101","00:22:43,831",I think they might find a way to make it work in your case.
Inception,"00:22:44,003","00:22:48,497","Look, I, uh, brought these for you to give to the kids when you have a chance."
Inception,"00:22:48,675","00:22:51,269",It'll take more than the occasional stuffed animal...
Inception,"00:22:51,444","00:22:54,413",...to convince those children they still have a father.
Inception,"00:22:54,581","00:22:57,414",I'm just doing what I know. I'm doing what you taught me.
Inception,"00:22:57,584","00:22:59,108",I never taught you to be a thief.
Inception,"00:22:59,285","00:23:01,480","No, you taught me to navigate people's minds."
Inception,"00:23:01,654","00:23:02,951",But after what happened...
Inception,"00:23:03,123","00:23:06,684",...there weren't a whole lot of legitimate ways for me to use that skill.
Inception,"00:23:11,831","00:23:13,321","What are you doing here, Dom?"
Inception,"00:23:15,435","00:23:17,835",I think I found a way home.
Inception,"00:23:18,004","00:23:21,565","It's a job for some very, very powerful people."
Inception,"00:23:21,808","00:23:26,211",People who I believe can fix my charges permanently.
Inception,"00:23:27,013","00:23:28,275",But I need your help.
Inception,"00:23:28,982","00:23:32,281",You're here to corrupt one of my brightest and best.
Inception,"00:23:32,452","00:23:35,353",You know what I'm offering. Let them decide for themselves.
Inception,"00:23:35,522","00:23:36,989",- Money. - Not just money.
Inception,"00:23:37,157","00:23:38,488",You remember.
Inception,"00:23:38,658","00:23:41,889","It's the chance to build cathedrals, entire cities..."
Inception,"00:23:42,061","00:23:43,824",...things that never existed...
Inception,"00:23:43,997","00:23:47,194",...things that couldn't exist in the real world.
Inception,"00:23:47,367","00:23:52,532",So you want me to let someone else follow you into your fantasy?
Inception,"00:23:52,705","00:23:54,673",They don't actually come into the dream.
Inception,"00:23:54,841","00:23:58,106",They just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.
Inception,"00:23:58,278","00:23:59,506",Design it yourself.
Inception,"00:24:02,182","00:24:03,672",Mal won't let me.
Inception,"00:24:09,889","00:24:12,016","Come back to reality, Dom."
Inception,"00:24:13,359","00:24:15,919",- Please. - Reality.
Inception,"00:24:16,296","00:24:18,821","Those kids, your grandchildren..."
Inception,"00:24:18,998","00:24:22,991",...they're waiting for their father to come back home. That's their reality.
Inception,"00:24:23,169","00:24:26,366","And this job, this last job, that's how I get there."
Inception,"00:24:26,906","00:24:30,535",I would not be standing here if I knew any other way.
Inception,"00:24:33,713","00:24:36,614",I need an architect who's as good as I was.
Inception,"00:24:40,820","00:24:42,811",I've got somebody better.
Inception,"00:24:42,989","00:24:44,013",Ariadne?
Inception,"00:24:46,626","00:24:49,151",I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.
Inception,"00:24:49,562","00:24:50,654",Pleased to meet you.
Inception,"00:24:50,830","00:24:55,494","If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has a job offer he'd like to discuss with you."
Inception,"00:24:55,668","00:24:56,692",A work placement?
Inception,"00:24:57,103","00:24:58,400",Not exactly.
Inception,"00:24:58,571","00:24:59,902",I have a test for you.
Inception,"00:25:00,640","00:25:02,699",You're not gonna tell me anything first?
Inception,"00:25:02,875","00:25:05,503","Before I describe the job, I have to know you can do it."
Inception,"00:25:05,678","00:25:08,875","- Why? - It's not, strictly speaking, legal."
Inception,"00:25:11,985","00:25:16,649",You have two minutes to design a maze that it takes one minute to solve.
Inception,"00:25:18,591","00:25:19,717",Stop.
Inception,"00:25:22,161","00:25:23,355",Again.
Inception,"00:25:25,498","00:25:26,829",Stop.
Inception,"00:25:30,003","00:25:32,062",You're gonna have to do better than that.
Inception,"00:25:45,084","00:25:46,346",That's more like it.
Inception,"00:26:06,539","00:26:09,440",They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential.
Inception,"00:26:09,609","00:26:11,304","Now, that's when we're awake."
Inception,"00:26:11,477","00:26:14,446","When we're asleep, our mind can do almost anything."
Inception,"00:26:14,614","00:26:15,638",Such as?
Inception,"00:26:15,815","00:26:19,808",Imagine you're designing a building. You consciously create each aspect.
Inception,"00:26:19,986","00:26:23,820","But sometimes, it feels like it's almost creating itself, if you know what I mean."
Inception,"00:26:23,990","00:26:25,958","Yeah, like I'm discovering it."
Inception,"00:26:26,125","00:26:28,389","Genuine inspiration, right?"
Inception,"00:26:28,561","00:26:31,894","Now, in a dream, our mind continuously does this."
Inception,"00:26:32,065","00:26:36,695",We create and perceive our world simultaneously.
Inception,"00:26:36,869","00:26:40,270",And our mind does this so well that we don't even know it's happening.
Inception,"00:26:40,440","00:26:43,170",That allows us to get right in the middle of that process.
Inception,"00:26:43,343","00:26:45,709",- How? - By taking over the creating part.
Inception,"00:26:45,878","00:26:47,505","Now, this is where I need you."
Inception,"00:26:47,680","00:26:50,046",You create the world of the dream.
Inception,"00:26:50,216","00:26:55,586","We bring the subject into that dream, and they fill it with their subconscious."
Inception,"00:26:55,755","00:27:00,419",How could I ever acquire enough detail to make them think that it's reality?
Inception,"00:27:00,593","00:27:04,051","Well, dreams, they feel real while we're in them, right?"
Inception,"00:27:04,230","00:27:07,927",It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.
Inception,"00:27:09,402","00:27:10,801",Let me ask you a question.
Inception,"00:27:10,970","00:27:14,371","You never really remember the beginning of a dream, do you?"
Inception,"00:27:14,540","00:27:17,566",You always wind up right in the middle of what's going on.
Inception,"00:27:17,744","00:27:18,768","I guess, yeah."
Inception,"00:27:18,945","00:27:20,503",So how did we end up here?
Inception,"00:27:20,913","00:27:22,972","Well, we just came from the, uh..."
Inception,"00:27:23,182","00:27:26,618","Think about it, Ariadne. How did you get here?"
Inception,"00:27:27,220","00:27:29,120",Where are you right now?
Inception,"00:27:32,425","00:27:33,585",We're dreaming?
Inception,"00:27:33,760","00:27:36,194","You're in the middle of the workshop, sleeping."
Inception,"00:27:36,362","00:27:39,331",This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.
Inception,"00:28:16,669","00:28:18,796","If it's just a dream, then why are you-?"
Inception,"00:28:20,440","00:28:22,169","Because it's never just a dream, is it?"
Inception,"00:28:22,341","00:28:25,640","And a face full of glass hurts like hell. When you're in it, it feels real."
Inception,"00:28:25,812","00:28:28,007",That's why the military developed dream sharing.
Inception,"00:28:28,181","00:28:31,878","It was a training program for soldiers to shoot, stab and strangle each other..."
Inception,"00:28:32,051","00:28:33,177",...and then wake up.
Inception,"00:28:33,486","00:28:35,283",How did architects become involved?
Inception,"00:28:35,455","00:28:38,185","Well, someone had to design the dreams, right?"
Inception,"00:28:39,325","00:28:41,657",Why don't you give us another five minutes?
Inception,"00:28:41,828","00:28:42,920",Five minutes?
Inception,"00:28:44,297","00:28:46,629","What-? We were talking for, like, at least an hour."
Inception,"00:28:46,799","00:28:49,029","In a dream, your mind functions more quickly..."
Inception,"00:28:49,202","00:28:52,035",...therefore time seems to feel more slow.
Inception,"00:28:52,205","00:28:55,572",Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream.
Inception,"00:28:56,309","00:28:59,369",Why don't you see what you can get up to in five minutes?
Inception,"00:29:05,284","00:29:08,219","You've got the basic layout. Bookstore, café."
Inception,"00:29:08,387","00:29:10,048",Almost everything else is here too.
Inception,"00:29:10,223","00:29:13,158",Who are the people? - Projections of my subconscious.
Inception,"00:29:13,326","00:29:14,486",- Yours? - Yes.
Inception,"00:29:14,660","00:29:17,185","Remember, you are the dreamer. You build this world."
Inception,"00:29:17,363","00:29:20,025",I am the subject. My mind populates it.
Inception,"00:29:20,199","00:29:22,099",You can literally talk to my subconscious.
Inception,"00:29:22,268","00:29:25,169",That's one of the ways we extract information from the subject.
Inception,"00:29:25,338","00:29:26,600",How else do you do it?
Inception,"00:29:26,806","00:29:30,765","By creating something secure, like a bank vault or a jail."
Inception,"00:29:30,943","00:29:34,674",The mind automatically fills it with information it's trying to protect.
Inception,"00:29:34,847","00:29:37,611",- You understand? - Then you break in and steal it?
Inception,"00:29:37,783","00:29:38,807",Well...
Inception,"00:29:38,985","00:29:43,479",I guess I thought that the dream space would be all about the visual...
Inception,"00:29:43,656","00:29:45,521",...but it's more about the feel of it.
Inception,"00:29:45,992","00:29:50,122",My question is what happens when you start messing with the physics of it all?
Inception,"00:30:31,470","00:30:33,028","It's something, isn't it?"
Inception,"00:30:34,140","00:30:35,437","Yes, it is."
Inception,"00:30:59,365","00:31:00,889",Why are they all looking at me?
Inception,"00:31:01,067","00:31:04,559",Because my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world.
Inception,"00:31:04,737","00:31:09,037","The more you change things, the quicker the projections start to converge on you."
Inception,"00:31:09,208","00:31:10,266",Converge?
Inception,"00:31:10,443","00:31:12,502",They sense the foreign nature of the dreamer.
Inception,"00:31:12,678","00:31:15,340","They attack, like white blood cells fighting an infection."
Inception,"00:31:15,514","00:31:18,347","- What, they're gonna attack us? - No, no."
Inception,"00:31:18,918","00:31:20,476",Just you.
Inception,"00:31:24,390","00:31:28,656","This is great, but I'm telling you, if you keep changing things like this..."
Inception,"00:31:32,164","00:31:35,133","Jeez, mind telling your subconscious to take it easy?"
Inception,"00:31:35,301","00:31:37,963",It's my subconscious. Remember? I can't control it.
Inception,"00:32:31,624","00:32:32,989",Very impressive.
Inception,"00:32:44,737","00:32:48,264","I know this bridge. This place is real, isn't it?"
Inception,"00:32:48,441","00:32:50,773","Yeah, I cross it every day to get to the college."
Inception,"00:32:50,943","00:32:54,379",Never re-create places from your memory. Always imagine new places.
Inception,"00:32:54,547","00:32:56,378","You draw from stuff you know, right?"
Inception,"00:32:56,549","00:33:00,747",Only use details. A streetlamp or a phone booth. Never entire areas.
Inception,"00:33:00,920","00:33:03,047",- Why not? - Building a dream from your memory...
Inception,"00:33:03,222","00:33:06,714",...is the easiest way to lose your grasp on what's real and what is a dream.
Inception,"00:33:06,892","00:33:08,951",- Is that what happened to you? - Listen to me.
Inception,"00:33:09,128","00:33:11,119","This has nothing to do with me, understand?"
Inception,"00:33:11,297","00:33:13,265",That why you need me to build your dreams?
Inception,"00:33:13,432","00:33:15,957","Hey, get off of her. Back up. Back up."
Inception,"00:33:16,135","00:33:17,762",- Cobb! Cobb! - Get off of her!
Inception,"00:33:17,937","00:33:19,871",- Let me go! Let me go! - Mal!
Inception,"00:33:20,372","00:33:22,465",- Mal! - Cobb! Wake me up!
Inception,"00:33:22,641","00:33:24,438",- Wake me up! Wake me up! - No!
Inception,"00:33:24,610","00:33:26,100","- Mal, no! No! - Wake me up!"
Inception,"00:33:27,747","00:33:31,706","Hey, hey, hey. Look at me. You're okay. You're okay."
Inception,"00:33:31,884","00:33:35,115",- Hey. - Why wouldn't I wake up?
Inception,"00:33:35,421","00:33:37,013",There was still time on the clock.
Inception,"00:33:37,189","00:33:39,714",You can't wake up from within the dream unless you die.
Inception,"00:33:39,892","00:33:41,484",- She'll need a totem. What?
Inception,"00:33:41,660","00:33:43,127","A totem, it's a small personal-"
Inception,"00:33:43,295","00:33:45,820","That's some subconscious you've got on you, Cobb!"
Inception,"00:33:45,998","00:33:47,829",- She's a real charmer. - Oh.
Inception,"00:33:48,000","00:33:50,628",- I see you met Mrs. Cobb. - She's his wife?
Inception,"00:33:50,803","00:33:54,534","Yeah. So a totem. You need a small object, potentially heavy."
Inception,"00:33:54,707","00:33:57,175",Something you can have on you that no one else knows.
Inception,"00:33:57,343","00:33:58,605",Like a coin? No.
Inception,"00:33:58,778","00:34:03,408","It needs to be more unique than that. Like, this is a loaded die."
Inception,"00:34:04,517","00:34:07,418","No, I can't let you touch it. That would defeat the purpose."
Inception,"00:34:07,586","00:34:11,784","See, only I know the balance and the weight of this particular loaded die."
Inception,"00:34:11,957","00:34:13,788","That way, when you look at your totem..."
Inception,"00:34:13,959","00:34:17,053",...you know beyond a doubt that you're not in someone else's dream.
Inception,"00:34:20,499","00:34:24,799","I don't know if you can't see what's going on, or if you just don't want to..."
Inception,"00:34:24,970","00:34:28,497",...but Cobb has some serious problems that he's tried to bury down there.
Inception,"00:34:28,674","00:34:32,610",And I'm not about to just open my mind to someone like that.
Inception,"00:34:38,751","00:34:42,152",She'll be back. I've never seen anyone pick it up that quickly before.
Inception,"00:34:42,621","00:34:46,819","Reality's not gonna be enough for her now, and when she comes back..."
Inception,"00:34:47,493","00:34:50,155","When she comes back, you're gonna have her building mazes."
Inception,"00:34:50,329","00:34:52,593",- Where are you gonna be? - I gotta go visit Eames.
Inception,"00:34:52,765","00:34:55,893","Eames? No, he's in Mombasa. It's Cobol's back yard."
Inception,"00:34:56,068","00:34:57,660",It's a necessary risk.
Inception,"00:34:58,070","00:35:01,301","- Well, there's plenty of good thieves. - We don't just need a thief."
Inception,"00:35:02,441","00:35:03,465",We need a forger.
Inception,"00:35:12,184","00:35:14,744","Rub them together all you want, they're not gonna breed."
Inception,"00:35:15,321","00:35:16,345",You never know.
Inception,"00:35:17,289","00:35:19,314",I'm gonna get you a drink.
Inception,"00:35:21,493","00:35:22,858",You're buying.
Inception,"00:35:29,335","00:35:31,633",- Your spelling hasn't improved. - Piss off.
Inception,"00:35:31,804","00:35:33,772",How's your handwriting?
Inception,"00:35:33,939","00:35:35,770",- It's versatile. - Good.
Inception,"00:35:35,941","00:35:37,169",Thank you very much.
Inception,"00:35:37,843","00:35:39,208",Inception.
Inception,"00:35:39,445","00:35:42,278","Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible, let me-"
Inception,"00:35:42,448","00:35:45,747","No, it's perfectly possible. It's just bloody difficult."
Inception,"00:35:45,918","00:35:49,183",Interesting. Because Arthur keeps telling me it can't be done.
Inception,"00:35:49,622","00:35:52,591",Hmm. Arthur. You still working with that stick in the mud?
Inception,"00:35:52,758","00:35:54,453","He is good at what he does, right?"
Inception,"00:35:54,627","00:35:56,686","Oh, he's the best, but he has no imagination."
Inception,"00:35:56,862","00:35:57,886",Not like you.
Inception,"00:35:58,063","00:36:01,032","Listen, if you're gonna perform inception, you need imagination."
Inception,"00:36:01,200","00:36:04,761",Let me ask you something. Have you done it before?
Inception,"00:36:04,937","00:36:08,566","We tried it. Uh, we got the idea in place, but it didn't take."
Inception,"00:36:08,741","00:36:12,074","- You didn't plant it deep enough? - No, it's not just about depth."
Inception,"00:36:12,244","00:36:14,235",You need the simplest version of the idea...
Inception,"00:36:14,413","00:36:18,076",...in order for it to grow naturally in your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.
Inception,"00:36:18,250","00:36:20,775","So, what is this idea that you need to plant?"
Inception,"00:36:20,953","00:36:25,151",We need the heir of a major corporation to dissolve his father's empire.
Inception,"00:36:25,324","00:36:27,758",Right there you have various political motivations...
Inception,"00:36:27,927","00:36:29,918",...and anti-monopolistic sentiments and so forth.
Inception,"00:36:30,095","00:36:31,926","But all of that stuff, it's, um..."
Inception,"00:36:32,097","00:36:34,964","It's really at the mercy of your subject's prejudice, you see?"
Inception,"00:36:35,134","00:36:37,625",What you have to do is start at the absolute basic.
Inception,"00:36:37,803","00:36:39,361",Which is what?
Inception,"00:36:39,872","00:36:41,772",The relationship with the father.
Inception,"00:36:43,976","00:36:45,637","- Do you have a chemist? - No, not yet."
Inception,"00:36:45,811","00:36:48,871","Right. Okay, well, there's a man here, Yusuf."
Inception,"00:36:49,048","00:36:52,484","He, uh, formulates his own versions of the compounds."
Inception,"00:36:52,651","00:36:53,948",Why don't you take me there?
Inception,"00:36:54,119","00:36:57,179",Once you've lost your tail. The man at the bar.
Inception,"00:36:57,356","00:36:58,823",Cobol Engineering.
Inception,"00:36:58,991","00:37:01,323","That price on my head, was that dead or alive?"
Inception,"00:37:01,493","00:37:04,018",Don't remember. Let's see if he starts shooting.
Inception,"00:37:04,196","00:37:07,825","Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs in the bar in, say, uh, half an hour?"
Inception,"00:37:08,000","00:37:09,991",- Back here? - This is the last place they'd suspect.
Inception,"00:37:12,538","00:37:13,869",All right.
Inception,"00:37:15,040","00:37:16,871",Freddy. Freddy Simmonds.
Inception,"00:37:17,042","00:37:18,509","My God, it's you, isn't it?"
Inception,"00:37:22,047","00:37:23,105","No, it isn't you."
Inception,"00:37:23,282","00:37:24,715","Not dreaming now, are you?"
Inception,"00:37:26,919","00:37:28,511",Get him!
Inception,"00:37:44,036","00:37:45,162",There!
Inception,"00:38:05,657","00:38:07,420",One café.
Inception,"00:38:11,764","00:38:12,924",Shh.
Inception,"00:38:18,570","00:38:20,037",One café.
Inception,"00:38:21,073","00:38:22,540",One café.
Inception,"00:39:17,129","00:39:18,596","Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?"
Inception,"00:39:20,199","00:39:24,295",- What are you doing in Mombasa? - I'm here to protect my investment.
Inception,"00:39:26,805","00:39:29,740","Ah. So this is your idea of losing a tail, huh?"
Inception,"00:39:29,908","00:39:30,932",Different tail.
Inception,"00:39:39,651","00:39:41,380",Cobb said you'd be back.
Inception,"00:39:42,521","00:39:46,048","- I tried not to come, but... - But there's nothing quite like it."
Inception,"00:39:46,225","00:39:47,886",It's just...
Inception,"00:39:49,394","00:39:50,725",...pure creation.
Inception,"00:39:50,896","00:39:53,387",Shall we take a look at some paradoxical architecture?
Inception,"00:39:53,565","00:39:55,556",You're gonna have to master a few tricks...
Inception,"00:39:55,734","00:39:59,261",...if you're gonna build three complete dream levels. Excuse me.
Inception,"00:39:59,438","00:40:00,871",What kind of tricks?
Inception,"00:40:01,039","00:40:04,531","In a dream, you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes."
Inception,"00:40:04,710","00:40:08,612","That lets you create closed loops, like the Penrose Steps."
Inception,"00:40:09,481","00:40:11,472",The infinite staircase.
Inception,"00:40:14,186","00:40:15,619",See?
Inception,"00:40:19,791","00:40:20,849",Paradox.
Inception,"00:40:21,026","00:40:22,425",So a closed loop like that...
Inception,"00:40:22,594","00:40:25,688",...will help you disguise the boundaries of the dream you create.
Inception,"00:40:25,864","00:40:27,832",But how big do these levels have to be?
Inception,"00:40:28,000","00:40:31,128",It could be anything from the floor of a building to an entire city.
Inception,"00:40:31,303","00:40:34,739",They have to be complicated enough that we can hide from the projections.
Inception,"00:40:34,907","00:40:36,306","- A maze? - Right, a maze."
Inception,"00:40:36,475","00:40:37,806",And the better the maze...
Inception,"00:40:38,010","00:40:40,672",Then the longer we have before the projections catch us?
Inception,"00:40:40,846","00:40:42,108",Exactly.
Inception,"00:40:42,781","00:40:46,410","- My subconscious seems polite enough. - Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly."
Inception,"00:40:46,585","00:40:49,486",No one likes to feel someone else messing around in their mind.
Inception,"00:40:49,655","00:40:51,748","Cobb can't build anymore, can he?"
Inception,"00:40:53,592","00:40:55,423","I don't know if he can't, but he won't."
Inception,"00:40:55,594","00:40:57,994",He thinks it's safer if he doesn't know the layouts.
Inception,"00:40:58,163","00:40:59,255",Why?
Inception,"00:40:59,431","00:41:01,661",He won't tell me. But I think it's Mal.
Inception,"00:41:02,100","00:41:04,398","- His ex-wife? - No, not his ex."
Inception,"00:41:04,570","00:41:07,733",- They're still together? - No.
Inception,"00:41:08,974","00:41:10,464","No, she's dead."
Inception,"00:41:12,444","00:41:15,174",What you see in there is just his projection of her.
Inception,"00:41:18,717","00:41:20,184",What was she like in real life?
Inception,"00:41:20,852","00:41:22,376",She was lovely.
Inception,"00:41:26,091","00:41:28,457",You are seeking a chemist? Yes.
Inception,"00:41:28,627","00:41:30,754",To formulate compounds for a job?
Inception,"00:41:31,430","00:41:33,295",And to go into the field with us.
Inception,"00:41:33,465","00:41:35,695","No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb."
Inception,"00:41:35,867","00:41:39,598","Well, we'd need you there to tailor compounds specific to our needs."
Inception,"00:41:39,771","00:41:41,864",- Which are? - Great depth.
Inception,"00:41:42,040","00:41:45,305",A dream within a dream? Two levels?
Inception,"00:41:48,080","00:41:49,104",Three.
Inception,"00:41:49,281","00:41:52,842",Not possible. That many dreams within dreams is too unstable.
Inception,"00:41:53,018","00:41:56,977",It is possible. You just have to add a sedative.
Inception,"00:41:57,155","00:41:59,817",A powerful sedative.
Inception,"00:42:01,627","00:42:03,857",- How many team members? - Five.
Inception,"00:42:04,029","00:42:05,758",Six.
Inception,"00:42:06,632","00:42:10,659",The only way to know you've done the job is if I go in with you.
Inception,"00:42:10,836","00:42:13,930","There's no room for tourists on a job like this, Mr. Saito."
Inception,"00:42:14,106","00:42:16,472","This time, it seems there is."
Inception,"00:42:17,409","00:42:21,140","This, I think, is a good place to start. I use it every day."
Inception,"00:42:21,313","00:42:23,440","What for? - Here, I'll show you."
Inception,"00:42:27,753","00:42:29,482",Perhaps you will not want to see.
Inception,"00:42:32,424","00:42:34,016",After you.
Inception,"00:42:43,335","00:42:46,327",Ten. Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell.
Inception,"00:42:46,505","00:42:48,268",They come every day to share the dream.
Inception,"00:42:51,310","00:42:53,870",You see? Very stable.
Inception,"00:42:59,584","00:43:03,645","- How long do they dream for? Three, four hours, each day."
Inception,"00:43:03,922","00:43:04,946",In dream time?
Inception,"00:43:05,123","00:43:08,786","With this compound? About 40 hours, each and every day."
Inception,"00:43:08,960","00:43:12,259","- Why do they do it? Tell him, Mr. Cobb."
Inception,"00:43:13,799","00:43:16,233","After a while, it becomes the only way you can dream."
Inception,"00:43:16,401","00:43:18,335","Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?"
Inception,"00:43:18,970","00:43:22,371",- They come here every day to sleep? No.
Inception,"00:43:24,109","00:43:26,805",They come to be woken up.
Inception,"00:43:27,813","00:43:31,112",The dream has become their reality.
Inception,"00:43:32,050","00:43:34,416","Who are you to say otherwise, sir?"
Inception,"00:43:36,722","00:43:38,349",Let's see what you can do.
Inception,"00:43:49,334","00:43:50,926",You know how to find me.
Inception,"00:43:53,538","00:43:55,529",You know what you have to do.
Inception,"00:44:00,779","00:44:01,837","Sharp, no?"
Inception,"00:44:17,429","00:44:20,262","Are you all right, Mr. Cobb?"
Inception,"00:44:20,799","00:44:24,565","Yeah, yeah. Everything's just fine."
Inception,"00:44:33,011","00:44:36,708","Robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate."
Inception,"00:44:36,882","00:44:38,782",What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?
Inception,"00:44:38,950","00:44:40,542",That's not your concern.
Inception,"00:44:40,952","00:44:45,321","Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical corporate espionage."
Inception,"00:44:45,490","00:44:47,082",You asked me for inception.
Inception,"00:44:47,259","00:44:50,626",I do hope you understand the gravity of that request.
Inception,"00:44:50,796","00:44:54,755","Now, the seed that we plant in this man's mind will grow into an idea."
Inception,"00:44:54,933","00:44:56,798",This idea will define him.
Inception,"00:44:56,968","00:44:58,799",It may come to change...
Inception,"00:44:58,970","00:45:01,268","Well, it may come to change everything about him."
Inception,"00:45:01,440","00:45:05,774",We're the last company standing between them and total energy dominance.
Inception,"00:45:05,944","00:45:08,003",And we can no longer compete.
Inception,"00:45:08,180","00:45:11,638","Soon, they'll control the energy supply of half the world."
Inception,"00:45:11,817","00:45:14,183","In effect, they become a new superpower."
Inception,"00:45:15,587","00:45:18,920",The world needs Robert Fischer to change his mind.
Inception,"00:45:19,090","00:45:20,648",That's where we come in.
Inception,"00:45:20,826","00:45:24,091",How is Robert Fischer's relationship with his father?
Inception,"00:45:24,262","00:45:26,992",Rumor is the relationship is quite complicated.
Inception,"00:45:27,165","00:45:29,656","Well, we can't work based solely on rumor, can we?"
Inception,"00:45:29,835","00:45:33,032",Can you get me access to this man here? Browning.
Inception,"00:45:33,205","00:45:37,369",Fischer Senior's right-hand man. Fischer Junior's godfather.
Inception,"00:45:37,542","00:45:40,807","It should be possible, if you can get the right references."
Inception,"00:45:40,979","00:45:45,439","References are something of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito."
Inception,"00:45:46,084","00:45:49,019",I'm not smelling settlement here. Take them down.
Inception,"00:45:49,187","00:45:50,279",Mr. Browning...
Inception,"00:45:50,455","00:45:54,289",...Maurice Fischer's policy is always one of avoiding litigation.
Inception,"00:45:56,862","00:46:01,322","Well, shall we voice your concerns with Maurice directly?"
Inception,"00:46:01,500","00:46:02,899",Not sure that's necessary.
Inception,"00:46:03,068","00:46:05,730","No, no, no. I think we should."
Inception,"00:46:27,025","00:46:28,583",How is he?
Inception,"00:46:29,427","00:46:32,191","I don't want to bother him unnecessarily, but-"
Inception,"00:46:32,364","00:46:37,825","Robert, I told you keep out the damn- Wait. So do it. Get-"
Inception,"00:46:38,103","00:46:41,197",Mr. Fischer. Put it through.
Inception,"00:46:41,573","00:46:45,168","Never, never. Never do the same as I asked."
Inception,"00:46:46,478","00:46:48,139",Leave that.
Inception,"00:46:51,850","00:46:53,215",Here.
Inception,"00:46:55,487","00:46:57,887",Must be a cherished memory of his.
Inception,"00:46:58,990","00:47:03,518",I put it beside his bed. He hasn't even noticed.
Inception,"00:47:03,695","00:47:05,356",Robert...
Inception,"00:47:07,732","00:47:10,132",...we need to talk about a power of attorney.
Inception,"00:47:10,302","00:47:13,601","- I know this is hard, but it's imperative- - Not now, Uncle Peter."
Inception,"00:47:17,609","00:47:19,406",The vultures are circling.
Inception,"00:47:19,578","00:47:23,981","And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the more powerful Peter Browning becomes."
Inception,"00:47:24,149","00:47:26,549",I've had ample opportunity to observe Browning...
Inception,"00:47:27,185","00:47:31,554","...and adopt his physical presence, study his mannerisms, and so on and so forth."
Inception,"00:47:31,723","00:47:35,591","So now in the first layer of the dream, I can impersonate Browning."
Inception,"00:47:35,760","00:47:38,991",And suggest concepts to Fischer's conscious mind.
Inception,"00:47:39,164","00:47:40,995","Then, when we take him a level deeper..."
Inception,"00:47:41,166","00:47:44,658",...his own projection of Browning should feed that right back to him.
Inception,"00:47:44,836","00:47:46,770",So he gives himself the idea.
Inception,"00:47:46,938","00:47:51,170",Precisely. That's the only way it will stick. It has to seem self-generated.
Inception,"00:47:51,343","00:47:54,744","Eames, I am impressed."
Inception,"00:47:54,913","00:47:58,474","Your condescension, as always, is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you."
Inception,"00:48:19,838","00:48:21,829",Were you going under on your own?
Inception,"00:48:22,007","00:48:25,499","No, no, I was just, uh, running some experiments."
Inception,"00:48:25,677","00:48:27,645","I didn't realize anyone was here, so..."
Inception,"00:48:27,812","00:48:30,474","Yeah, I was just- I was working on my totem, actually."
Inception,"00:48:30,649","00:48:31,809","Here, let me take a look."
Inception,"00:48:33,985","00:48:35,282","So you're learning, huh?"
Inception,"00:48:35,453","00:48:38,945",An elegant solution for keeping track of reality.
Inception,"00:48:39,591","00:48:41,991","- Was it your idea? - No, it was, uh..."
Inception,"00:48:42,227","00:48:44,286","It was Mal's, actually. This..."
Inception,"00:48:44,996","00:48:48,762",This one was hers. She would spin it in the dream and it would never topple.
Inception,"00:48:48,967","00:48:51,868",Just spin and spin.
Inception,"00:48:53,405","00:48:55,339",Arthur told me she passed away.
Inception,"00:48:57,242","00:48:59,301",How are the mazes coming along?
Inception,"00:48:59,477","00:49:02,378",Each level relates to the part of the subject's subconscious...
Inception,"00:49:02,547","00:49:04,014",...that we are trying to access.
Inception,"00:49:04,182","00:49:09,620","So I'm making the bottom level a hospital, so Fischer will bring his father."
Inception,"00:49:09,988","00:49:12,752","You know, l- Actually, I have a question about this layout."
Inception,"00:49:12,924","00:49:17,657","No, no, no. Don't show me specifics. Only the dreamer should know the layout."
Inception,"00:49:17,829","00:49:18,989",Why is that so important?
Inception,"00:49:19,164","00:49:21,155",In case one of us brings in our projections.
Inception,"00:49:21,332","00:49:23,664",We don't want them knowing the details of the maze.
Inception,"00:49:25,070","00:49:27,538",You mean in case you bring Mal in.
Inception,"00:49:27,706","00:49:30,106","You can't keep her out, can you?"
Inception,"00:49:31,009","00:49:32,533",- Right. - You can't build...
Inception,"00:49:32,711","00:49:36,010","...because if you know the maze, then she knows it."
Inception,"00:49:36,181","00:49:38,376","Well, she'd sabotage the whole operation."
Inception,"00:49:38,550","00:49:41,348","- Cobb, do the others know? - No. No, they don't."
Inception,"00:49:41,519","00:49:43,749",You've gotta warn them if this is getting worse.
Inception,"00:49:43,922","00:49:45,856",No one said it's getting worse.
Inception,"00:49:47,058","00:49:50,357",I need to get home. That's all I care about right now.
Inception,"00:49:51,229","00:49:53,288",Why can't you go home?
Inception,"00:49:56,401","00:49:58,426",Because they think I killed her.
Inception,"00:50:01,673","00:50:03,937",- Thank you. - For what?
Inception,"00:50:04,142","00:50:06,406",For not asking whether I did.
Inception,"00:50:06,578","00:50:08,739","""I will split up my father's empire."""
Inception,"00:50:08,913","00:50:13,111","Now, this is obviously an idea that Robert himself would choose to reject..."
Inception,"00:50:13,284","00:50:16,082",...which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious.
Inception,"00:50:16,254","00:50:19,781","The subconscious is motivated by emotion, right? Not reason."
Inception,"00:50:19,958","00:50:23,724",We need to find a way to translate this into an emotional concept.
Inception,"00:50:23,895","00:50:26,329",How do you translate business strategy into emotion?
Inception,"00:50:26,498","00:50:30,093",That's what we're here to figure out. Robert's relationship with his father...
Inception,"00:50:30,268","00:50:32,998","...is stressed, to say the least. - Can we run with that?"
Inception,"00:50:33,171","00:50:36,766","We suggest breaking up his father's company as a ""screw you"" to the old man."
Inception,"00:50:36,941","00:50:40,399","No, because I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time."
Inception,"00:50:40,812","00:50:44,509","We all yearn for reconciliation, for catharsis."
Inception,"00:50:44,682","00:50:48,448",We need Robert Fischer to have a positive emotional reaction to all this.
Inception,"00:50:48,620","00:50:50,451","All right, well, try this. Um..."
Inception,"00:50:50,622","00:50:55,355","""My father accepts that I want to create for myself, not follow in his footsteps."""
Inception,"00:50:55,760","00:50:56,818",That might work.
Inception,"00:50:56,995","00:51:00,158","Might? We're gonna need to do a little better than ""might."""
Inception,"00:51:00,331","00:51:02,299","Thank you for your contribution, Arthur."
Inception,"00:51:02,467","00:51:05,402","Forgive me for wanting a little specificity, Eames."
Inception,"00:51:05,603","00:51:06,695",Specificity?
Inception,"00:51:06,871","00:51:08,702",Inception's not about being specific.
Inception,"00:51:08,873","00:51:12,832","When we get inside his mind, we're gonna have to work with what we find."
Inception,"00:51:14,145","00:51:17,137","On the top level, we open up his relationship with his father..."
Inception,"00:51:17,315","00:51:20,375","...and say, ""I will not follow in my father's footsteps."""
Inception,"00:51:20,552","00:51:25,216","Then the next level down, we feed him, ""I will create something for myself."""
Inception,"00:51:25,390","00:51:28,723","Then, by the time we hit the bottom level, we bring out the big guns."
Inception,"00:51:28,893","00:51:31,293","- ""My father doesn't want me to be him."" Exactly."
Inception,"00:51:32,664","00:51:36,657","Three layers down, the dreams are gonna collapse with the slightest disturbance."
Inception,"00:51:36,835","00:51:37,995",Sedation.
Inception,"00:51:38,169","00:51:41,002",For sleep stable enough to create three layers of dreaming...
Inception,"00:51:41,172","00:51:45,074",...we'll have to combine it with an extremely powerful sedative.
Inception,"00:51:56,521","00:51:57,579",Good night.
Inception,"00:51:58,189","00:52:00,384",The compound we'll be using to share the dream...
Inception,"00:52:00,558","00:52:02,492",...creates a clear connection between dreamers...
Inception,"00:52:02,660","00:52:06,892","...whilst accelerating brain function. - In other words, more time on each level."
Inception,"00:52:07,065","00:52:10,228",Brain function in the dream will be about 20 times normal.
Inception,"00:52:10,401","00:52:13,893","And when you enter a dream within that dream, the effect is compounded."
Inception,"00:52:14,072","00:52:16,165","It's three dreams, that's 10 hours times 20-"
Inception,"00:52:16,341","00:52:19,242",Math was never my strong subject. How much time is that?
Inception,"00:52:19,410","00:52:22,072","It's a week, the first level down."
Inception,"00:52:22,780","00:52:25,613","Six months the second level down, and the third level-"
Inception,"00:52:25,783","00:52:27,216",That's 10 years.
Inception,"00:52:29,854","00:52:32,015",Who'd wanna be stuck in a dream for 10 years?
Inception,"00:52:32,423","00:52:33,583",Depends on the dream.
Inception,"00:52:33,758","00:52:36,056","So once we've made the plant, how do we get out?"
Inception,"00:52:36,227","00:52:39,560",I'm hoping you have something more elegant than shooting me in the head.
Inception,"00:52:39,731","00:52:42,495",- A kick. - What's a kick?
Inception,"00:52:42,667","00:52:45,363","This, Ariadne, would be a kick."
Inception,"00:52:47,505","00:52:50,201",It's that feeling of falling you get that jolts you awake.
Inception,"00:52:50,375","00:52:53,606",- Snaps you out of the dream. - We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?
Inception,"00:52:53,778","00:52:54,972",That's the clever part.
Inception,"00:52:55,146","00:52:58,377",I customized the sedative to leave inner-ear function unimpaired.
Inception,"00:52:58,549","00:53:03,384","That way, however deep the sleep, the sleeper still feels falling."
Inception,"00:53:03,554","00:53:05,920",Or tipping.
Inception,"00:53:06,557","00:53:10,721",The trick is to synchronize a kick that can penetrate all three levels.
Inception,"00:53:11,262","00:53:14,789",We could use a musical countdown to synchronize the different kicks.
Inception,"00:53:22,674","00:53:26,166","He hasn't got any surgery scheduled, no dental, nothing."
Inception,"00:53:26,344","00:53:28,335",Wasn't he supposed to have a knee operation?
Inception,"00:53:28,513","00:53:31,744","Nothing. Nothing that they'll put him under for, anyway. And we need-"
Inception,"00:53:31,916","00:53:33,850",We need at least a good 10 hours.
Inception,"00:53:34,018","00:53:35,349",Sydney to Los Angeles.
Inception,"00:53:36,688","00:53:40,954",One of the longest flights in the world. He makes it every two weeks.
Inception,"00:53:41,125","00:53:43,286","He must be flying private, then."
Inception,"00:53:43,795","00:53:46,958",Not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane.
Inception,"00:53:47,131","00:53:49,361",It would have to be a 747. - Why's that?
Inception,"00:53:49,534","00:53:51,001","On a 747, the pilot's up top..."
Inception,"00:53:51,169","00:53:54,366","...the first-class cabin's in the nose, so no one would walk through."
Inception,"00:53:54,539","00:53:58,031",You'd have to buy out the entire cabin and the first-class flight attendant.
Inception,"00:53:58,209","00:53:59,767",I bought the airline.
Inception,"00:54:01,346","00:54:03,143",It seemed neater.
Inception,"00:54:04,749","00:54:07,547","Well, looks like we have our 10 hours."
Inception,"00:54:08,219","00:54:11,347","Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way."
Inception,"00:54:59,370","00:55:01,531",You know how to find me.
Inception,"00:55:03,007","00:55:04,440",You know what you have to do.
Inception,"00:55:08,279","00:55:11,737",You remember when you asked me to marry you?
Inception,"00:55:12,617","00:55:14,642",Of course I do.
Inception,"00:55:15,753","00:55:18,244",You said you had a dream.
Inception,"00:55:21,192","00:55:23,956",That we'd grow old together.
Inception,"00:55:25,396","00:55:27,091",And we can.
Inception,"00:55:33,771","00:55:35,705",You shouldn't be here.
Inception,"00:55:39,477","00:55:42,935",Just wanted to see what kind of tests you're doing on your own every night.
Inception,"00:55:43,114","00:55:46,311",- This has nothing to do with you. - This has everything to do with me.
Inception,"00:55:46,484","00:55:52,286",- You've asked me to share dreams with you. - Not these. These are my dreams.
Inception,"00:56:03,167","00:56:05,567",Why do you do this to yourself?
Inception,"00:56:05,736","00:56:08,671",It's the only way I can still dream.
Inception,"00:56:10,441","00:56:12,636",Why is it so important to dream?
Inception,"00:56:13,544","00:56:15,808","In my dreams, we're still together."
Inception,"00:56:30,161","00:56:31,890",These aren't just dreams.
Inception,"00:56:33,698","00:56:36,724",These are memories. And you said never to use memories.
Inception,"00:56:36,901","00:56:37,959",I know I did.
Inception,"00:56:38,603","00:56:43,131",You're trying to keep her alive. You can't let her go.
Inception,"00:56:43,307","00:56:46,299",You don't understand. These are moments I regret.
Inception,"00:56:46,477","00:56:49,037",They're memories that I have to change.
Inception,"00:56:50,281","00:56:52,749","Well, what's down there that you regret?"
Inception,"00:56:53,151","00:56:56,279","Listen, there's only one thing you need to understand about me."
Inception,"00:57:04,762","00:57:06,354",This is your house?
Inception,"00:57:07,031","00:57:09,499","Mine and Mal's, yes."
Inception,"00:57:09,667","00:57:11,362",Where is she?
Inception,"00:57:12,036","00:57:14,027",She's already gone.
Inception,"00:57:18,776","00:57:20,300","That's my son, James."
Inception,"00:57:20,478","00:57:23,572","He's digging for something, maybe a worm."
Inception,"00:57:24,949","00:57:26,075",That's Phillipa.
Inception,"00:57:26,617","00:57:28,482",I thought about calling out to them...
Inception,"00:57:28,653","00:57:31,417",...so they'd turn and smile and I could see...
Inception,"00:57:32,123","00:57:37,254","...those beautiful faces of theirs, but it's all too late."
Inception,"00:57:37,428","00:57:40,261","Right now or never, Cobb."
Inception,"00:57:44,735","00:57:46,532",Then I start to panic.
Inception,"00:57:46,704","00:57:49,400",I realize I'm gonna regret this moment...
Inception,"00:57:50,241","00:57:52,573",...that I need to see their faces one last time.
Inception,"00:57:52,743","00:57:55,234",James! Phillipa! Come on in!
Inception,"00:57:55,413","00:57:57,438",But the moment's past.
Inception,"00:57:59,650","00:58:03,017","And whatever I do, I can't change this moment."
Inception,"00:58:03,921","00:58:06,082",As I'm about to call out to them...
Inception,"00:58:07,124","00:58:08,216",...they run away.
Inception,"00:58:10,962","00:58:14,227","If I'm ever gonna see their faces again, I've gotta get back home."
Inception,"00:58:15,266","00:58:16,756",The real world.
Inception,"00:58:58,342","00:58:59,809",What are you doing here?
Inception,"00:59:00,645","00:59:01,737",My name is-
Inception,"00:59:01,912","00:59:05,211",I know who you are. What are you doing here?
Inception,"00:59:13,391","00:59:15,825",I'm just trying to understand.
Inception,"00:59:15,993","00:59:18,120",How could you understand?
Inception,"00:59:19,330","00:59:21,457",Do you know what it is to be a lover?
Inception,"00:59:23,467","00:59:25,594",To be half of a whole?
Inception,"00:59:26,837","00:59:28,395",No.
Inception,"00:59:29,874","00:59:31,865",I'll tell you a riddle.
Inception,"00:59:33,344","00:59:35,642",You're waiting for a train.
Inception,"00:59:36,681","00:59:39,844",A train that will take you far away.
Inception,"00:59:41,218","00:59:44,187",You know where you hope this train will take you...
Inception,"00:59:45,222","00:59:47,486",...but you don't know for sure.
Inception,"00:59:47,658","00:59:49,558",But it doesn't matter.
Inception,"00:59:50,528","00:59:53,929",How can it not matter to you where that train will take you?
Inception,"00:59:54,098","00:59:55,861",Because you'll be together.
Inception,"00:59:56,901","00:59:59,995","How could you bring her here, Dom? - What is this place?"
Inception,"01:00:00,404","01:00:03,567",This is a hotel suite where we used to spend our anniversary.
Inception,"01:00:03,741","01:00:05,072",What happened here?
Inception,"01:00:06,977","01:00:09,810",You promised! You promised we'd be together!
Inception,"01:00:10,247","01:00:12,306","Please, I need you to stay here just for now!"
Inception,"01:00:12,483","01:00:15,714",You said we'd be together! You said we'd grow old together!
Inception,"01:00:15,886","01:00:18,354",I'll come back for you. I promise.
Inception,"01:00:36,574","01:00:41,944",Do you think you can just build a prison of memories to lock her in?
Inception,"01:00:42,580","01:00:44,946",Do you really think that that's gonna contain her?
Inception,"01:00:45,850","01:00:47,112",It's time.
Inception,"01:00:48,352","01:00:50,684",Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.
Inception,"01:00:50,855","01:00:53,016",- When's the funeral? - Thursday. In Los Angeles.
Inception,"01:00:53,190","01:00:56,455",Robert should accompany the body no later than Tuesday. We should move.
Inception,"01:00:56,627","01:00:58,094",All right.
Inception,"01:00:58,696","01:01:01,722","- Cobb, I'm coming with you. - I promised Miles. No."
Inception,"01:01:01,899","01:01:05,027",The team needs someone who understands what you're struggling with.
Inception,"01:01:07,605","01:01:09,766",And it doesn't have to be me...
Inception,"01:01:09,940","01:01:13,239",...but then you have to show Arthur what I just saw.
Inception,"01:01:19,016","01:01:20,711",Get us another seat on the plane.
Inception,"01:01:24,789","01:01:27,815",If I get on this plane and you don't honor our agreement...
Inception,"01:01:27,992","01:01:31,655","...when we land, I go to jail for the rest of my life."
Inception,"01:01:32,329","01:01:34,524",Complete the job en route...
Inception,"01:01:34,698","01:01:37,166",...I make one phone call from the plane...
Inception,"01:01:37,334","01:01:40,235",...you have no trouble getting through Immigration.
Inception,"01:01:53,984","01:01:56,475","- I'm sorry. - Oh, yeah, absolutely."
Inception,"01:01:56,654","01:01:58,212",Thank you.
Inception,"01:02:31,822","01:02:35,121","Excuse me, I think this is yours? You must have dropped it."
Inception,"01:02:35,292","01:02:37,192",Would you care for a drink?
Inception,"01:02:37,361","01:02:38,658","Oh. Water, please."
Inception,"01:02:38,829","01:02:41,127","Oh, um, same, please."
Inception,"01:02:42,099","01:02:43,396",Um...
Inception,"01:02:44,134","01:02:45,226",Thank you.
Inception,"01:02:45,402","01:02:47,267","You know, I couldn't help but notice..."
Inception,"01:02:47,438","01:02:51,033","...but you wouldn't happen to be related to the Maurice Fischer, would you?"
Inception,"01:02:51,208","01:02:52,698","Yes, he, um..."
Inception,"01:02:53,644","01:02:55,635",He was my father.
Inception,"01:02:56,080","01:03:00,107","Well, he was a very inspiring figure. I'm sorry for your loss."
Inception,"01:03:03,087","01:03:04,748",- Here you go. - Thank you.
Inception,"01:03:04,922","01:03:06,253",Hey.
Inception,"01:03:06,657","01:03:08,284",To your father.
Inception,"01:03:08,893","01:03:11,123","May he rest in peace, huh?"
Inception,"01:04:19,597","01:04:21,895",- Couldn't have peed before you went under? - Sorry.
Inception,"01:04:22,066","01:04:24,125",Bit too much free champagne before takeoff?
Inception,"01:04:24,301","01:04:25,393","Ha, ha, bloody ha."
Inception,"01:04:25,569","01:04:28,538",We know he's gonna be looking for a taxi in this weather.
Inception,"01:04:40,217","01:04:44,244","- Asshole! Hey, man, why don't you try-? - Walk away."
Inception,"01:05:00,137","01:05:01,536",Just have him ca- I gotta go.
Inception,"01:05:01,705","01:05:03,832",All right. Taxi. Thank you.
Inception,"01:05:06,777","01:05:09,644","All right, Third and Market. Snappy."
Inception,"01:05:10,214","01:05:12,546","- What are you doing? - Sorry, I thought it was free."
Inception,"01:05:12,716","01:05:14,206",- It's not. - Maybe we could share.
Inception,"01:05:14,385","01:05:17,218",Maybe not. Can you pull over and get this-?
Inception,"01:05:20,190","01:05:21,521",Great.
Inception,"01:05:26,463","01:05:27,930",Come on.
Inception,"01:05:39,043","01:05:41,671",There's $500 in there. The wallet's worth more than that.
Inception,"01:05:41,845","01:05:43,540",You might at least drop me at my stop.
Inception,"01:05:43,714","01:05:44,806",I'm afraid that it doesn't-
Inception,"01:05:54,525","01:05:56,322",- Cover him! Down! Down now!
Inception,"01:05:56,493","01:05:58,120",What the hell is going on?
Inception,"01:06:01,865","01:06:04,095",This wasn't in the design.
Inception,"01:06:05,035","01:06:06,400",Cobb?
Inception,"01:06:06,637","01:06:07,661",Cobb?
Inception,"01:06:58,589","01:06:59,783",Get him!
Inception,"01:07:06,463","01:07:07,896",Are you all right?
Inception,"01:07:08,098","01:07:10,259","Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay."
Inception,"01:07:10,434","01:07:12,334","Fischer's okay, unless he gets carsick."
Inception,"01:07:12,503","01:07:13,731",Saito?
Inception,"01:07:32,656","01:07:34,783",Get Fischer in the back room now.
Inception,"01:07:35,092","01:07:37,788",- Get him in the back room. Move. What the hell happened?
Inception,"01:07:38,228","01:07:39,695",Has he been shot? Is he dying?
Inception,"01:07:39,863","01:07:41,592",I don't know. - Jesus Christ.
Inception,"01:07:41,765","01:07:44,199",What happened to you? - Blocked by a freight train.
Inception,"01:07:44,368","01:07:46,336",Why put a train in a downtown intersection?
Inception,"01:07:46,503","01:07:48,095",- I didn't. Where'd it come from?
Inception,"01:07:48,272","01:07:49,933",Why the hell were we ambushed?
Inception,"01:07:50,107","01:07:53,508","Those were not normal projections. They'd been trained, for God's sakes."
Inception,"01:07:53,677","01:07:56,237",- How could he be trained? - Fischer's had an extractor...
Inception,"01:07:56,413","01:08:00,611","...teach his subconscious to defend itself, so his subconscious is militarized."
Inception,"01:08:00,784","01:08:02,411",It should've shown in the research.
Inception,"01:08:02,586","01:08:04,383",Why the hell didn't it? - Calm down.
Inception,"01:08:04,555","01:08:05,886",Don't tell me to calm down!
Inception,"01:08:06,056","01:08:08,991","This was your job, goddamn it! This was your responsibility!"
Inception,"01:08:09,159","01:08:11,218",You were meant to check Fischer's background!
Inception,"01:08:11,395","01:08:14,728",- We are not prepared for this! - We have dealt with sub-security before!
Inception,"01:08:14,898","01:08:16,991",We'll be more careful and we're gonna be fine!
Inception,"01:08:17,167","01:08:18,964",This was not a part of the plan! He's dying.
Inception,"01:08:19,136","01:08:20,194",Put him out his misery.
Inception,"01:08:20,370","01:08:23,203","- No, don't do that! Don't do that. - Cobb, hey, hey."
Inception,"01:08:23,373","01:08:25,466",He's in agony. I'm waking him up.
Inception,"01:08:25,642","01:08:27,542",No. It won't wake him up.
Inception,"01:08:27,711","01:08:31,306","What do you mean, it won't wake him up? When we die in a dream, we wake up."
Inception,"01:08:31,481","01:08:32,743",Not from this.
Inception,"01:08:32,916","01:08:35,441",We're too heavily sedated to wake up that way.
Inception,"01:08:36,053","01:08:37,748","Right. So, what happens when we die?"
Inception,"01:08:37,921","01:08:39,752",- We drop into limbo. - Are you serious?
Inception,"01:08:39,923","01:08:42,448",- Limbo? Unconstructed dream space.
Inception,"01:08:42,626","01:08:45,891","Well, what the hell is down there? - Just raw, infinite subconscious."
Inception,"01:08:46,063","01:08:49,260","Nothing is down there, except for what might have been left behind..."
Inception,"01:08:49,433","01:08:52,334",...by anyone sharing the dream who's been trapped there before.
Inception,"01:08:52,502","01:08:54,402","Which, in our case, is just you."
Inception,"01:08:54,571","01:08:57,267",- How long could we be stuck? Can't even think about...
Inception,"01:08:57,441","01:08:59,841",...trying to escape until the sedation- - How long?
Inception,"01:09:00,010","01:09:03,241","Decades. It could be infinite. Ask him, he's the one who's been there."
Inception,"01:09:03,413","01:09:04,607",Let's get him upstairs.
Inception,"01:09:06,250","01:09:07,683",Great.
Inception,"01:09:08,685","01:09:10,152",Thank you.
Inception,"01:09:10,854","01:09:14,085","So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind, battling his own private army."
Inception,"01:09:14,258","01:09:15,725",And if we get killed...
Inception,"01:09:15,893","01:09:19,124","...we'll be lost in limbo till our brains turn to scrambled egg, hmm?"
Inception,"01:09:26,036","01:09:27,867",Someone got first aid?
Inception,"01:09:30,140","01:09:33,598",- You knew these risks and didn't tell us? - There weren't meant to be risks.
Inception,"01:09:33,777","01:09:36,712",- I didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire. - You had no right.
Inception,"01:09:36,880","01:09:39,212",This was the only way to go three layers deep.
Inception,"01:09:39,383","01:09:41,408",You knew about this and went along with it?
Inception,"01:09:41,585","01:09:42,609",I trusted him.
Inception,"01:09:42,786","01:09:44,686",When? When he promised you half his share?
Inception,"01:09:44,855","01:09:48,120","No. His whole share. Besides, he said he'd done it before."
Inception,"01:09:48,292","01:09:50,351","What, with Mal? Because that worked so good?"
Inception,"01:09:50,527","01:09:53,963",That has nothing to do with it. I did what I had to to get to my children.
Inception,"01:09:54,131","01:09:56,031",You led us into a war zone with no way out?
Inception,"01:09:56,199","01:10:00,226","There is a way out. We continue on with the job, and we do it as fast as possible..."
Inception,"01:10:00,404","01:10:02,736","...and we get out using the kick, just like before."
Inception,"01:10:02,906","01:10:05,374","Forget it. We go any deeper, we just raise the stakes."
Inception,"01:10:05,542","01:10:07,407",I am sitting this one out on this level.
Inception,"01:10:07,577","01:10:10,011",Fischer's security is surrounding this place.
Inception,"01:10:10,180","01:10:12,444",Ten hours of flight time is a week at this level.
Inception,"01:10:12,616","01:10:16,347",That means each and every one of us will be killed. That I can guarantee you.
Inception,"01:10:16,954","01:10:20,720",We have no other choice but to continue on and do it as fast as possible.
Inception,"01:10:22,326","01:10:24,760",Downwards is the only way forwards.
Inception,"01:10:26,330","01:10:27,456",Get ready.
Inception,"01:10:27,631","01:10:29,826","You, come on. Let's go shake him up."
Inception,"01:10:34,671","01:10:37,697",I'm insured against kidnapping for up to 10 million.
Inception,"01:10:37,874","01:10:40,809",- This should be very simple. Shut up! It won't be.
Inception,"01:10:40,978","01:10:43,242","In your father's office, below the bookshelves..."
Inception,"01:10:43,413","01:10:45,472",...is his personal safe. We need the combination.
Inception,"01:10:46,850","01:10:48,249",I don't know any safe.
Inception,"01:10:48,452","01:10:51,319",That doesn't mean you don't know the combination.
Inception,"01:10:52,956","01:10:54,287",Tell us what it is.
Inception,"01:10:55,158","01:10:56,887",I don't know.
Inception,"01:11:01,832","01:11:03,959",We have it on good authority you do know.
Inception,"01:11:04,134","01:11:06,466",Yeah? Whose authority?
Inception,"01:11:07,971","01:11:11,463","- Five hundred dollars, this cost. What's inside it?"
Inception,"01:11:11,742","01:11:15,508","Cash, cards, ID. And this."
Inception,"01:11:20,550","01:11:22,040",Useful?
Inception,"01:11:22,786","01:11:23,810",Maybe.
Inception,"01:11:24,287","01:11:26,084",You're on. You've got an hour.
Inception,"01:11:26,490","01:11:27,514",An hour?
Inception,"01:11:28,825","01:11:31,089",I was supposed to have all night to crack this.
Inception,"01:11:31,261","01:11:33,855",And Saito wasn't supposed to be shot in the chest.
Inception,"01:11:34,031","01:11:37,194","You've got one hour, now get us something useful, please."
Inception,"01:11:39,736","01:11:42,170",- What's that? - Good authority.
Inception,"01:11:46,410","01:11:48,105",Uncle Peter.
Inception,"01:11:48,812","01:11:50,939",Just make them stop.
Inception,"01:11:51,248","01:11:53,580",- The combination. - I don't know it.
Inception,"01:11:53,750","01:11:56,412",- Why does Browning say you do? - I don't know.
Inception,"01:11:56,586","01:11:59,054",Just let me talk to him and I'll find out.
Inception,"01:12:01,425","01:12:04,121",You have one hour. Start talking.
Inception,"01:12:06,129","01:12:07,323",You all right?
Inception,"01:12:09,232","01:12:10,529",You okay?
Inception,"01:12:14,237","01:12:17,900",Those bastards have had at me for two days.
Inception,"01:12:18,575","01:12:21,043",They have someone with access to your father's office.
Inception,"01:12:21,211","01:12:23,076",- They're trying to open his safe. - Yeah.
Inception,"01:12:23,246","01:12:25,976","They thought I'd know the combination, but I don't know it."
Inception,"01:12:26,149","01:12:28,879","- Yeah, well, neither do I, so... - What?"
Inception,"01:12:29,653","01:12:32,884","Maurice told me that when he passed, you were the only one able to open it."
Inception,"01:12:33,056","01:12:35,581","No, he never gave me any combination."
Inception,"01:12:36,326","01:12:40,456","Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you just didn't know it was a combination."
Inception,"01:12:40,630","01:12:41,824","Well, what, then?"
Inception,"01:12:41,998","01:12:44,523","I don't know, some meaningful combination of numbers..."
Inception,"01:12:44,701","01:12:48,637",...based on your experiences with Maurice.
Inception,"01:12:50,340","01:12:54,276","We didn't have very many, uh, meaningful experiences together."
Inception,"01:12:55,011","01:12:56,478",Perhaps after your mother died.
Inception,"01:12:59,149","01:13:01,276","After my mother died, you know what he told me?"
Inception,"01:13:03,760","01:13:08,720","""Robert, there's really nothing to be said."""
Inception,"01:13:08,898","01:13:11,230","Oh, well, he was bad with emotion."
Inception,"01:13:11,401","01:13:14,097","I was 11, Uncle Peter."
Inception,"01:13:14,871","01:13:18,102",- How's he doing? - He's in a lot of pain.
Inception,"01:13:18,274","01:13:21,869","When we get down to the lower levels, the pain will be less intense."
Inception,"01:13:22,045","01:13:23,273",And if he dies?
Inception,"01:13:24,447","01:13:25,914",Worst-case scenario?
Inception,"01:13:26,082","01:13:28,778","When he wakes up, his mind is completely gone."
Inception,"01:13:28,952","01:13:33,013","Cobb, I'll still honor the arrangement."
Inception,"01:13:33,189","01:13:34,884","I appreciate that, Saito."
Inception,"01:13:35,058","01:13:39,119","But when you wake up, you won't even remember that we had an arrangement."
Inception,"01:13:39,295","01:13:41,320",Limbo is gonna become your reality.
Inception,"01:13:41,498","01:13:45,264",You're gonna be lost down there so long that you're gonna become an old man.
Inception,"01:13:45,735","01:13:47,066",Filled with regret?
Inception,"01:13:48,505","01:13:49,597",Waiting to die alone.
Inception,"01:13:50,273","01:13:51,365",No.
Inception,"01:13:51,941","01:13:53,568",I'll come back.
Inception,"01:13:54,377","01:13:57,039",And we'll be young men together again.
Inception,"01:14:03,019","01:14:04,077",Breathe.
Inception,"01:14:04,254","01:14:07,280",These people are gonna kill us if we don't give them the combination.
Inception,"01:14:07,457","01:14:09,357",- They just wanna ransom us. - I heard them.
Inception,"01:14:09,526","01:14:13,428","They're gonna lock us in that van, and then drive it into the river."
Inception,"01:14:13,596","01:14:15,063",All right. What is in the safe?
Inception,"01:14:16,166","01:14:17,326",Something for you.
Inception,"01:14:17,967","01:14:22,097",Maurice always said it was his most precious gift to you.
Inception,"01:14:22,839","01:14:25,899",- A will. - Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.
Inception,"01:14:26,076","01:14:27,304",That's an alternate.
Inception,"01:14:27,477","01:14:29,843",This would supersede the other if you want it to.
Inception,"01:14:30,013","01:14:32,641",It splits up the component businesses of Fischer Morrow.
Inception,"01:14:32,816","01:14:36,513",It'd be the end of the entire empire as we know it.
Inception,"01:14:36,686","01:14:39,154",Destroying my whole inheritance?
Inception,"01:14:40,824","01:14:43,987",- Why would he suggest such a thing? - I just don't know.
Inception,"01:14:46,863","01:14:48,831","He loved you, Robert."
Inception,"01:14:49,399","01:14:51,026",In his own way.
Inception,"01:14:51,201","01:14:52,998",In his own way.
Inception,"01:14:54,304","01:14:55,828",At the end...
Inception,"01:14:56,973","01:14:59,305",...he called me in to his deathbed.
Inception,"01:14:59,809","01:15:01,640",He could barely speak.
Inception,"01:15:02,712","01:15:06,944",But he took the trouble to tell me one last thing.
Inception,"01:15:09,452","01:15:11,079",He pulled me close.
Inception,"01:15:13,757","01:15:15,850",And I could only make out...
Inception,"01:15:16,726","01:15:18,159",...one word.
Inception,"01:15:21,865","01:15:23,833","""Disappointed."""
Inception,"01:15:29,472","01:15:30,666",When were you in limbo?
Inception,"01:15:32,242","01:15:35,734",You might have the rest of the team convinced to carry on with this job.
Inception,"01:15:35,912","01:15:38,278",- But they don't know the truth. - Truth? What truth?
Inception,"01:15:38,481","01:15:42,611","The truth that, at any minute, you might bring a freight train through the wall."
Inception,"01:15:42,786","01:15:46,847",The truth that Mal is bursting through your subconscious.
Inception,"01:15:47,023","01:15:49,423","And the truth that, as we go deeper into Fischer..."
Inception,"01:15:49,592","01:15:51,389",...we're also going deeper into you.
Inception,"01:15:52,228","01:15:55,493",And I'm not sure we're gonna like what we find.
Inception,"01:15:59,502","01:16:00,969",We were working together.
Inception,"01:16:01,137","01:16:04,800",We were exploring the concept of a dream within a dream.
Inception,"01:16:05,008","01:16:06,270",I kept pushing things.
Inception,"01:16:06,442","01:16:10,105",I wanted to go deeper and deeper. I wanted to go further.
Inception,"01:16:10,613","01:16:15,482",I just didn't understand the concept that hours could turn into years down there...
Inception,"01:16:15,652","01:16:18,382",...that we could get trapped so deep...
Inception,"01:16:19,222","01:16:22,521",...that when we wound up on the shore of our own subconscious...
Inception,"01:16:23,126","01:16:25,651",...we lost sight of what was real.
Inception,"01:16:31,734","01:16:34,294",We created. We built the world for ourselves.
Inception,"01:16:35,939","01:16:37,930",We did that for years.
Inception,"01:16:39,075","01:16:41,043",We built our own world.
Inception,"01:16:42,412","01:16:44,107",How long were you stuck there?
Inception,"01:16:45,281","01:16:47,374",Something like 50 years.
Inception,"01:16:50,787","01:16:51,947",Jesus.
Inception,"01:16:54,257","01:16:55,588",How could you stand it?
Inception,"01:16:55,758","01:16:58,488","It wasn't so bad at first, feeling like gods."
Inception,"01:16:58,661","01:17:01,687",The problem was knowing that none of it was real.
Inception,"01:17:01,865","01:17:06,268","Eventually, it just became impossible for me to live like that."
Inception,"01:17:06,436","01:17:07,835",And what about for her?
Inception,"01:17:11,307","01:17:15,209","She had locked something away, something deep inside her."
Inception,"01:17:16,613","01:17:21,846","A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget."
Inception,"01:17:24,787","01:17:27,278",Limbo became her reality.
Inception,"01:17:28,625","01:17:30,422",What happened when you woke up?
Inception,"01:17:30,960","01:17:34,623","Well, to wake up from that after years, after decades..."
Inception,"01:17:35,698","01:17:40,192",...to become old souls thrown back into youth like that?
Inception,"01:17:41,104","01:17:44,870",I knew something was wrong with her. She just wouldn't admit it.
Inception,"01:17:46,242","01:17:48,506","Eventually, she told me the truth."
Inception,"01:17:48,945","01:17:52,312",She was possessed by an idea.
Inception,"01:17:52,482","01:17:58,182",This one very simple idea that changed everything.
Inception,"01:17:59,322","01:18:01,790",That our world wasn't real.
Inception,"01:18:02,725","01:18:06,991",That she needed to wake up to come back to reality...
Inception,"01:18:07,530","01:18:09,896",...that in order to get back home...
Inception,"01:18:11,134","01:18:12,931",...we had to kill ourselves.
Inception,"01:18:19,575","01:18:23,033",- What about your children? - She thought they were projections...
Inception,"01:18:23,212","01:18:26,204",...that our real children were waiting for us up there somewhere.
Inception,"01:18:26,382","01:18:28,077",I'm their mother! Calm down.
Inception,"01:18:28,251","01:18:29,513",I can tell the difference.
Inception,"01:18:29,686","01:18:32,018","If this is my dream, why can't I control this?"
Inception,"01:18:32,188","01:18:33,883",You don't know you're dreaming!
Inception,"01:18:34,057","01:18:36,252",She was certain there was nothing I could do...
Inception,"01:18:36,426","01:18:40,260","...no matter how much I begged, no matter how much I pleaded."
Inception,"01:18:43,232","01:18:46,258","She wanted to do it, but she could not do it alone."
Inception,"01:18:46,436","01:18:52,932","She loved me too much, so she came up with a plan on our anniversary."
Inception,"01:19:19,002","01:19:21,800","- Sweetheart, what are you doing? - Join me."
Inception,"01:19:21,971","01:19:26,237","Just- Just step back inside. All right? Just step back inside now, come on."
Inception,"01:19:26,409","01:19:30,846","No. I'm going to jump, and you're coming with me."
Inception,"01:19:31,014","01:19:32,709","No, I'm not."
Inception,"01:19:32,882","01:19:34,975","Now, you listen to me."
Inception,"01:19:35,585","01:19:39,817","If you jump, you're not gonna wake up, remember? You're gonna die."
Inception,"01:19:39,989","01:19:41,923","Now, just step back inside."
Inception,"01:19:42,091","01:19:44,821",Come on. Step back inside so we can talk about this.
Inception,"01:19:44,994","01:19:46,928",We've talked enough.
Inception,"01:19:48,998","01:19:50,659",- Mal. - Come out onto the ledge...
Inception,"01:19:50,833","01:19:53,529",...or I'll jump right now. - Okay.
Inception,"01:19:57,807","01:19:59,604",We're gonna talk about this.
Inception,"01:20:00,476","01:20:01,636",All right?
Inception,"01:20:01,811","01:20:06,874","- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith. - No, honey."
Inception,"01:20:07,850","01:20:10,842","No, I can't. You know I can't do that."
Inception,"01:20:11,020","01:20:13,784","Take a second, think about our children."
Inception,"01:20:13,956","01:20:15,685",Think about James.
Inception,"01:20:16,426","01:20:18,053","Think about Phillipa, now."
Inception,"01:20:18,227","01:20:21,162","If I go without you, they'll take them away anyway."
Inception,"01:20:21,330","01:20:24,629",- What does that mean? - I filed a letter with our attorney...
Inception,"01:20:25,068","01:20:28,401",...explaining how I'm fearful for my safety.
Inception,"01:20:30,640","01:20:32,767",How you've threatened to kill me.
Inception,"01:20:35,578","01:20:38,206","- Why did you do this? - I love you, Dom."
Inception,"01:20:38,381","01:20:40,144",Why did-? Why would you do this to me?
Inception,"01:20:40,316","01:20:43,183",I've freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them.
Inception,"01:20:43,352","01:20:46,378",We're going home to our real children.
Inception,"01:20:46,556","01:20:50,185","Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me, all right? Mal, look at me, please?"
Inception,"01:20:50,359","01:20:51,656",You're waiting for a train.
Inception,"01:20:52,161","01:20:55,722","- Mal, goddamn it, don't do this! - A train that will take you far away."
Inception,"01:20:55,898","01:20:57,889",James and Phillipa are waiting for you!
Inception,"01:20:58,067","01:21:01,901","You know where you hope this train will take you, but you can't know for sure."
Inception,"01:21:02,071","01:21:04,266","- Mal, look at me! - But it doesn't matter."
Inception,"01:21:04,440","01:21:07,637","- Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me! - Because you'll be together."
Inception,"01:21:07,810","01:21:11,644","Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!"
Inception,"01:21:11,814","01:21:13,247",Jesus Christ!
Inception,"01:21:16,752","01:21:20,483",She had herself declared sane by three different psychiatrists.
Inception,"01:21:20,656","01:21:24,854",It made it impossible for me to try to explain the nature of her madness.
Inception,"01:21:25,027","01:21:26,255",So I ran.
Inception,"01:21:28,097","01:21:30,327","Right now, or never, Cobb."
Inception,"01:21:36,706","01:21:41,336",James! Phillipa! Come on in! Come on!
Inception,"01:21:41,611","01:21:42,669","All right, let's go."
Inception,"01:21:43,212","01:21:47,012",I left my children behind and I've been trying to buy my way back ever since.
Inception,"01:21:47,583","01:21:51,451",Your guilt defines her. It's what powers her.
Inception,"01:21:51,621","01:21:54,920",But you are not responsible for the idea that destroyed her.
Inception,"01:21:56,159","01:21:58,719",And if we are gonna succeed in this...
Inception,"01:21:58,895","01:22:03,855","...you have to forgive yourself, and you're gonna have to confront her."
Inception,"01:22:04,033","01:22:05,864",But you don't have to do that alone.
Inception,"01:22:06,035","01:22:08,299","- No, you're not... - I'm doing it for the others."
Inception,"01:22:08,971","01:22:14,068",Because they have no idea the risk they've taken coming down here with you.
Inception,"01:22:19,148","01:22:20,638",We have to move.
Inception,"01:22:20,816","01:22:22,249",Time's up.
Inception,"01:22:22,418","01:22:25,148",All right. I don't know any combination.
Inception,"01:22:25,321","01:22:28,415","- Not consciously, anyway. How about instinctively, huh?"
Inception,"01:22:28,591","01:22:32,527",I got somebody in your father's office right now ready to tap in the combination.
Inception,"01:22:32,695","01:22:35,596",Give me the first six numbers that come to your head right now.
Inception,"01:22:35,765","01:22:37,995",- I have no idea. - Right now!
Inception,"01:22:38,167","01:22:40,397","I said, right now! Right now!"
Inception,"01:22:40,570","01:22:44,472","Five, two, eight, four, nine, one."
Inception,"01:22:48,344","01:22:50,335",You'll have to do better than that.
Inception,"01:22:50,513","01:22:53,846",All right. Bag them. You're going for a ride.
Inception,"01:22:58,221","01:23:02,351",We're worth more to you alive. You hear me?
Inception,"01:23:07,630","01:23:09,120",What'd you get?
Inception,"01:23:09,532","01:23:12,057",Relationship with his father is worse than we imagined.
Inception,"01:23:12,235","01:23:13,259",This helps us how?
Inception,"01:23:13,436","01:23:16,530","The stronger the issues, the more powerful the catharsis."
Inception,"01:23:17,740","01:23:20,834",- How are we gonna reconcile them? - I'm working on that.
Inception,"01:23:21,010","01:23:24,537",Work faster. The projections are closing in quick.
Inception,"01:23:24,714","01:23:28,275",We gotta break out of here before we're totally boxed in.
Inception,"01:24:03,386","01:24:04,410",Damn it.
Inception,"01:24:04,587","01:24:07,579","You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling."
Inception,"01:24:24,340","01:24:27,332",We need to shift his animosity from his father to his godfather.
Inception,"01:24:27,510","01:24:31,537","- Destroy his one positive relationship? - No, repair his relationship with his father..."
Inception,"01:24:31,714","01:24:34,012",...whilst exposing his godfather's true nature.
Inception,"01:24:34,183","01:24:37,175",We should charge Fischer a lot more than Saito for this job.
Inception,"01:24:37,353","01:24:39,719",His security is gonna get worse as we go deeper.
Inception,"01:24:39,889","01:24:42,380",- I think we run with Mr. Charles. - No.
Inception,"01:24:42,792","01:24:44,225",Who's Mr. Charles? - Bad idea.
Inception,"01:24:44,393","01:24:47,920",The second we get into that hotel his security's gonna be all over us.
Inception,"01:24:48,097","01:24:50,190",We run with Mr. Charles like on the Stein job.
Inception,"01:24:50,366","01:24:52,698","- You've done it before? Yeah, and it didn't work."
Inception,"01:24:52,868","01:24:56,360",The subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces.
Inception,"01:24:56,539","01:24:58,564","Excellent. But you learned a lot, right?"
Inception,"01:24:58,741","01:25:00,834",- I need some kind of distraction. No problem.
Inception,"01:25:01,010","01:25:03,205",How about a lovely lady that I've used before?
Inception,"01:25:03,379","01:25:05,438","Listen to me. You drive carefully, all right?"
Inception,"01:25:05,614","01:25:08,082",Everything down there is gonna be unstable as hell.
Inception,"01:25:12,621","01:25:15,988",Don't jump too soon. We only got one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.
Inception,"01:25:16,158","01:25:19,457",I'll play the music to let you know it's coming. The rest is on you.
Inception,"01:25:19,628","01:25:21,425",- You ready? - Ready!
Inception,"01:25:22,665","01:25:23,757",Sweet dreams.
Inception,"01:25:23,933","01:25:25,833",Am I boring you?
Inception,"01:25:27,136","01:25:30,333",I was telling you my story. I guess it wasn't to your liking.
Inception,"01:25:32,174","01:25:34,836","Um, I have a lot on my mind."
Inception,"01:25:36,379","01:25:37,971",There goes Mr. Charles.
Inception,"01:25:42,685","01:25:45,313","Mr. Fischer, right?"
Inception,"01:25:45,488","01:25:48,980",Pleasure to see you again. Rod Green from marketing. L-
Inception,"01:25:49,158","01:25:50,284",Hmm.
Inception,"01:25:50,459","01:25:53,121",- And you must be? - Leaving.
Inception,"01:25:56,365","01:25:57,491",In case you get bored.
Inception,"01:26:02,738","01:26:04,103",Must've blown you off.
Inception,"01:26:04,273","01:26:07,003","That is, unless her phone number really is only six digits."
Inception,"01:26:09,178","01:26:13,615","Funny way to make friends, someone stealing your wallet like that."
Inception,"01:26:17,553","01:26:19,885",Goddamn it. The wallet alone is worth at least 500-
Inception,"01:26:20,055","01:26:21,181","About $500, right?"
Inception,"01:26:21,357","01:26:24,326",Don't worry about it. My people are already on it as we speak.
Inception,"01:26:24,493","01:26:26,427",Who or what is Mr. Charles?
Inception,"01:26:26,629","01:26:30,326",It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious.
Inception,"01:26:30,499","01:26:31,830",And why don't you approve?
Inception,"01:26:32,001","01:26:33,992",It involves telling the mark that he's dreaming...
Inception,"01:26:34,170","01:26:36,297",...which involves attracting a lot of attention to us.
Inception,"01:26:36,472","01:26:39,407",- Didn't Cobb say never to do that? - Hmm.
Inception,"01:26:39,575","01:26:41,338",So now you've noticed how much time...
Inception,"01:26:41,510","01:26:44,138",...Cobb spends doing things he says never to do.
Inception,"01:26:45,881","01:26:47,644","Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?"
Inception,"01:26:47,817","01:26:50,251","- I'm sorry, but... Hold on! Wait!"
Inception,"01:26:51,587","01:26:52,884",You look a bit perkier.
Inception,"01:26:53,055","01:26:55,387","Very amusing, Mr. Eames."
Inception,"01:27:01,630","01:27:03,120",Turbulence on the plane?
Inception,"01:27:03,299","01:27:04,994","No, it's much closer."
Inception,"01:27:05,167","01:27:06,828",That's Yusuf's driving.
Inception,"01:27:15,177","01:27:17,645","Um, I'm sorry. Who did you say you were?"
Inception,"01:27:17,813","01:27:19,906",Rod Green from marketing.
Inception,"01:27:20,082","01:27:21,674","But that's not true at all, is it?"
Inception,"01:27:23,786","01:27:27,244","My name is Mr. Charles. You remember me, don't you?"
Inception,"01:27:27,456","01:27:29,424",I'm the head of your security down here.
Inception,"01:27:30,693","01:27:32,627","Get out on a different floor, keep moving."
Inception,"01:27:32,795","01:27:35,127",Dump the wallet. Security will be looking for that.
Inception,"01:27:35,297","01:27:38,789",- Okay. - We need to buy Cobb a little more time.
Inception,"01:27:42,438","01:27:43,996","Security, huh?"
Inception,"01:27:46,442","01:27:48,603","- You work for the hotel? - No, no."
Inception,"01:27:48,777","01:27:53,373",I specialize in a very specific type of security.
Inception,"01:27:53,782","01:27:55,443",Subconscious security.
Inception,"01:27:55,618","01:27:57,711",You're talking about dreams?
Inception,"01:27:57,887","01:28:00,754","Are you talking about, um, extraction?"
Inception,"01:28:01,790","01:28:03,189",I am here to protect you.
Inception,"01:28:16,639","01:28:19,164","Mr. Fischer, I'm here to protect you in the event..."
Inception,"01:28:19,341","01:28:22,708",...that someone tries to access your mind through your dreams.
Inception,"01:28:22,878","01:28:25,506",You're not safe here.
Inception,"01:28:26,348","01:28:27,940",They're coming for you.
Inception,"01:28:46,302","01:28:48,327","Strange weather, isn't it?"
Inception,"01:28:53,175","01:28:54,301",You feel that?
Inception,"01:28:56,278","01:28:57,472",What's happening?
Inception,"01:28:57,646","01:29:00,877",Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention to the strangeness of the dream...
Inception,"01:29:01,050","01:29:03,917",...which is making his subconscious look for the dreamer.
Inception,"01:29:04,086","01:29:07,146","For me. Quick, give me a kiss."
Inception,"01:29:12,161","01:29:16,029","- They're still looking at us. - Yeah, it was worth a shot."
Inception,"01:29:16,699","01:29:18,724",We should probably get out of here.
Inception,"01:29:34,016","01:29:37,577","You feel that? You've actually been trained for this, Mr. Fischer."
Inception,"01:29:37,753","01:29:41,746","Pay attention to the strangeness of the weather, the shift in gravity."
Inception,"01:29:41,924","01:29:45,087",None of this is real. You're in a dream.
Inception,"01:29:49,898","01:29:52,128","Now, the easiest way for you to test yourself..."
Inception,"01:29:52,334","01:29:56,395",...is to try and remember how you arrived at this hotel. Can you do that?
Inception,"01:29:57,239","01:29:58,536","Yeah, I..."
Inception,"01:29:58,707","01:30:01,232","No, breathe, breathe. Remember your training."
Inception,"01:30:01,410","01:30:06,575","Accept the fact that you're in a dream, and I'm here to protect you. Go on."
Inception,"01:30:08,584","01:30:09,949",Mm-hm.
Inception,"01:30:12,755","01:30:14,586",- You're not real? - No.
Inception,"01:30:14,757","01:30:18,124",No. I'm a projection of your subconscious.
Inception,"01:30:18,293","01:30:20,386",I was sent here to protect you in the event...
Inception,"01:30:20,562","01:30:23,463",...that extractors tried to pull you into a dream.
Inception,"01:30:23,632","01:30:26,863","And I believe that's what's going on right now, Mr. Fischer."
Inception,"01:30:27,970","01:30:28,994",Yeah.
Inception,"01:30:29,171","01:30:30,263",Okay.
Inception,"01:30:31,173","01:30:32,401",Okay.
Inception,"01:30:35,244","01:30:37,235",Can you get me out of here?
Inception,"01:30:38,147","01:30:40,741",Right away. Follow me.
Inception,"01:30:54,963","01:30:56,294",Hold on a second.
Inception,"01:31:01,236","01:31:03,067",Jesus Christ! What are you doing?
Inception,"01:31:03,238","01:31:05,502","These men were sent here to abduct you, all right?"
Inception,"01:31:05,674","01:31:08,234","If you want my help, you have to remain calm."
Inception,"01:31:09,978","01:31:12,276","I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer."
Inception,"01:31:23,992","01:31:27,587","If this is a dream, I should just kill myself to wake up, right?"
Inception,"01:31:27,763","01:31:29,856","I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mr. Fischer."
Inception,"01:31:30,032","01:31:33,524","I believe they have you sedated, and if you pull that trigger..."
Inception,"01:31:33,702","01:31:34,862",...you may not wake up.
Inception,"01:31:36,004","01:31:40,304","You may go into a further dream state. Now, you know what I'm talking about."
Inception,"01:31:42,644","01:31:44,305",You remember the training.
Inception,"01:31:45,447","01:31:46,846",Remember what I said to you.
Inception,"01:31:47,716","01:31:48,876",Give me the gun.
Inception,"01:32:00,696","01:32:03,290",- This room should be directly below 528? - Yeah.
Inception,"01:32:12,674","01:32:14,164","Think, Mr. Fischer, think."
Inception,"01:32:14,343","01:32:18,177",What do you remember from before this dream?
Inception,"01:32:18,547","01:32:21,175","There was, um, a lot of gunfire."
Inception,"01:32:21,350","01:32:23,944",There was rain.
Inception,"01:32:24,486","01:32:26,078",Uncle Peter.
Inception,"01:32:26,355","01:32:29,984","- Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped. - Where were they holding you?"
Inception,"01:32:33,028","01:32:36,293",- They had us in the back of a van. - That explains the gravity shifts.
Inception,"01:32:36,498","01:32:38,557",You're in the back of a van. Keep going.
Inception,"01:32:38,734","01:32:40,998","It had something to do with, um..."
Inception,"01:32:41,637","01:32:44,504",Something to do with a safe.
Inception,"01:32:45,140","01:32:46,767","God, why is it so hard to remember?"
Inception,"01:32:46,942","01:32:49,638",It's like trying to remember a dream after you've woken up.
Inception,"01:32:49,812","01:32:51,541","Listen, it takes years of practice."
Inception,"01:32:51,713","01:32:54,113",You and Browning have been pulled into this dream...
Inception,"01:32:54,283","01:32:57,047",...because they're trying to steal something from your mind.
Inception,"01:32:57,219","01:33:00,780",I need you to focus and try and remember what that is.
Inception,"01:33:00,956","01:33:02,583","What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!"
Inception,"01:33:02,758","01:33:06,489",A combination. They demanded the first numbers to pop into my head.
Inception,"01:33:06,662","01:33:09,392",They're trying to extract a number from your subconscious.
Inception,"01:33:09,565","01:33:13,331",It can represent anything. We're in a hotel right now.
Inception,"01:33:14,136","01:33:17,264","We should try hotel rooms. What was the number, Mr. Fischer?"
Inception,"01:33:17,439","01:33:20,272",Try and remember for me. This is very important.
Inception,"01:33:20,442","01:33:21,773",Five.
Inception,"01:33:22,744","01:33:25,178","Five, two- It was something, it was a long number."
Inception,"01:33:25,347","01:33:27,440",That's good. We can start there. Fifth floor.
Inception,"01:33:27,616","01:33:28,640",Yep.
Inception,"01:33:28,817","01:33:32,844","- So do you use a timer? - No, I have to judge it for myself."
Inception,"01:33:33,055","01:33:36,320","While you're all asleep in 528, I wait for Yusuf's kick."
Inception,"01:33:36,491","01:33:38,618","- Well, how will you know? - His music warns me."
Inception,"01:33:38,794","01:33:42,730","And then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge, that should be unmistakable."
Inception,"01:33:42,898","01:33:46,095",So we get a nice synchronized kick.
Inception,"01:33:46,268","01:33:48,668","If it's too soon, we won't get pulled out."
Inception,"01:33:48,837","01:33:52,102","But if it's too late, I won't be able to drop us."
Inception,"01:33:52,274","01:33:56,074","- Well, why not? - Because the van will be in freefall."
Inception,"01:33:56,612","01:33:59,445",- Can't drop you without gravity. - Right.
Inception,"01:34:05,087","01:34:07,317",They're with me. Go on.
Inception,"01:34:31,647","01:34:32,671",Mr. Charles.
Inception,"01:34:32,848","01:34:35,817","- Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer? - Yeah, I think so."
Inception,"01:34:35,984","01:34:38,043",They were trying to put you under.
Inception,"01:34:38,487","01:34:40,546",- I'm already under. - Under again.
Inception,"01:34:40,722","01:34:43,282","What do you mean, a dream within a dream?"
Inception,"01:34:43,892","01:34:46,360",Hey. I see you've changed.
Inception,"01:34:46,528","01:34:48,155",I'm sorry?
Inception,"01:34:48,664","01:34:52,532","Oh, I'm sorry. I mistook you for a friend."
Inception,"01:34:52,701","01:34:53,963",Oh.
Inception,"01:34:54,136","01:34:56,263","Good-looking fellow, I'm sure."
Inception,"01:34:56,939","01:34:59,874","No, no, no. That's Fischer's projection of Browning."
Inception,"01:35:00,042","01:35:01,907",Let's follow him and see how he behaves.
Inception,"01:35:02,077","01:35:04,045",- Why? - Because how he acts will tell us...
Inception,"01:35:04,212","01:35:07,545",...if Fischer is starting to suspect his motives the way we want him to.
Inception,"01:35:07,716","01:35:08,740",Shh.
Inception,"01:35:13,322","01:35:15,813",- Uncle Peter. - You said you were kidnapped together?
Inception,"01:35:15,991","01:35:19,427","Well, not exactly. They already had him. They were torturing him."
Inception,"01:35:19,594","01:35:21,061",And you saw them torture him?
Inception,"01:35:28,603","01:35:30,434",The kidnappers are working for you?
Inception,"01:35:31,406","01:35:32,873",Robert.
Inception,"01:35:33,041","01:35:36,875",You're trying to get that safe open? To get the alternate will?
Inception,"01:35:37,279","01:35:41,511",Fischer Morrow has been my entire life. I can't let you destroy it.
Inception,"01:35:41,683","01:35:44,049",I'm not gonna throw away my inheritance.
Inception,"01:35:44,219","01:35:48,383",I couldn't let you rise to your father's last taunt.
Inception,"01:35:49,191","01:35:52,217","- What taunt? - The will, Robert. That will?"
Inception,"01:35:52,394","01:35:54,328",That's his last insult.
Inception,"01:35:54,496","01:35:58,125",A challenge for you to build something for yourself...
Inception,"01:35:58,300","01:36:02,100",...by telling you you're not worthy of his accomplishments.
Inception,"01:36:07,776","01:36:13,146","- What, but that he was, um, disappointed? - I'm sorry."
Inception,"01:36:14,516","01:36:17,610",But he's wrong.
Inception,"01:36:18,353","01:36:20,981",You can build a better company than he ever did.
Inception,"01:36:21,156","01:36:23,590",Mr. Fischer? He's lying.
Inception,"01:36:23,759","01:36:25,852","- How do you know? - Trust me, it's what I do."
Inception,"01:36:26,028","01:36:28,792","He's hiding something, and we need to find out what that is."
Inception,"01:36:29,998","01:36:33,399",I need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you.
Inception,"01:36:35,971","01:36:40,032",We'll enter his subconscious and find out what he doesn't want you to know.
Inception,"01:36:41,309","01:36:42,776",All right.
Inception,"01:36:48,750","01:36:50,012",He's out. - Wait.
Inception,"01:36:50,185","01:36:52,244",Whose subconscious are we going into exactly?
Inception,"01:36:52,421","01:36:53,752",We're going into Fischer's.
Inception,"01:36:53,922","01:36:56,618",I told him it was Browning's so he'd be a part of our team.
Inception,"01:36:56,792","01:36:59,124",He's gonna help us break into his own subconscious.
Inception,"01:36:59,294","01:37:00,852",That's right.
Inception,"01:37:01,029","01:37:03,088",Security's gonna run you down hard.
Inception,"01:37:03,265","01:37:05,597",And I will lead them on a merry chase.
Inception,"01:37:06,168","01:37:08,796","- Just be back before the kick. - Go to sleep, Mr. Eames."
Inception,"01:37:14,009","01:37:15,203",You good?
Inception,"01:37:18,380","01:37:19,711",Hey. You ready?
Inception,"01:37:19,881","01:37:23,476","Yes, yes. I'm fine. I'm ready."
Inception,"01:37:36,031","01:37:37,362",Cobb?
Inception,"01:37:38,033","01:37:40,467",Cobb? What's down there?
Inception,"01:37:43,839","01:37:46,433","Hopefully, the truth we want Fischer to learn."
Inception,"01:37:46,608","01:37:48,508","I mean, what's down there for you?"
Inception,"01:40:25,100","01:40:26,863",Did you see that?
Inception,"01:40:45,353","01:40:47,184","Eames, this is your dream."
Inception,"01:40:47,355","01:40:50,449","I need you to draw the security away from the complex, understand?"
Inception,"01:40:50,625","01:40:52,422",- Who guides Fischer in? Not me.
Inception,"01:40:52,594","01:40:55,062","If I know the route, everything could be compromised."
Inception,"01:40:55,230","01:40:57,755","- I designed the place. No, you're with me."
Inception,"01:40:57,932","01:40:59,456",I could do it.
Inception,"01:40:59,901","01:41:02,335",All right. Brief him on the route into the complex.
Inception,"01:41:02,504","01:41:06,702","- Fischer, you'll be going with him. - All right. What about you?"
Inception,"01:41:06,875","01:41:09,708",You keep this live. I'll be listening in the whole time.
Inception,"01:41:09,878","01:41:14,008",The windows on that upper floor are big enough for me to cover you from that tower.
Inception,"01:41:14,182","01:41:15,479",You're not coming in?
Inception,"01:41:15,650","01:41:17,982",In order to find out the truth about your father...
Inception,"01:41:18,153","01:41:21,179",...you're gonna need to break into Browning's mind on your own.
Inception,"01:41:22,057","01:41:23,524","Come on, Fischer!"
Inception,"01:42:18,613","01:42:22,276","- Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm! - Go, go, go!"
Inception,"01:42:22,450","01:42:23,974",Move!
Inception,"01:42:25,520","01:42:26,578",Go!
Inception,"01:42:41,803","01:42:42,827",Sod it.
Inception,"01:42:54,015","01:42:55,676",I hope you're ready.
Inception,"01:43:04,426","01:43:06,189","No, it's too soon."
Inception,"01:43:12,700","01:43:13,894","Cobb, do you hear that?"
Inception,"01:43:14,068","01:43:17,629","I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago, I thought it was the wind up here."
Inception,"01:43:18,173","01:43:20,664","Yeah, I hear it. It's music."
Inception,"01:43:20,842","01:43:22,241","So, what do we do?"
Inception,"01:43:22,410","01:43:23,809",We move fast.
Inception,"01:43:29,317","01:43:31,547",Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.
Inception,"01:43:33,421","01:43:35,787",Which gives Arthur three minutes.
Inception,"01:43:36,724","01:43:38,817",- Hey! - That's him!
Inception,"01:43:39,494","01:43:41,223",- Which gives us what? - Sixty minutes.
Inception,"01:43:41,396","01:43:44,661",- Can they make that route in an hour? - They have to climb to the terrace.
Inception,"01:43:44,833","01:43:47,700","Then they need a new route, a more direct route."
Inception,"01:43:58,913","01:44:00,540",It's designed as a labyrinth.
Inception,"01:44:00,715","01:44:03,183",There must be access routes that cut through the maze.
Inception,"01:44:03,351","01:44:04,943",Eames?
Inception,"01:44:28,042","01:44:29,304",Did Eames add any features?
Inception,"01:44:29,477","01:44:30,944",I don't think I should tell you.
Inception,"01:44:31,112","01:44:33,410",We don't have time for this. Did he add anything?
Inception,"01:44:33,848","01:44:36,612",He added an air-duct system that can cut through the maze.
Inception,"01:44:36,784","01:44:37,978",Good. Explain it to them.
Inception,"01:44:38,152","01:44:39,380",Saito? - Go ahead.
Inception,"01:45:12,720","01:45:14,278",Paradox.
Inception,"01:46:24,158","01:46:26,217",What was that? - The kick.
Inception,"01:46:26,828","01:46:28,728","Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?"
Inception,"01:46:28,896","01:46:30,591","Yeah, we missed it."
Inception,"01:46:30,765","01:46:31,959",Man.
Inception,"01:46:32,133","01:46:36,433",Couldn't someone have dreamt up a goddamn beach? Huh?
Inception,"01:46:36,604","01:46:37,866",Uh-huh.
Inception,"01:46:38,606","01:46:40,767","Well, what the hell do we do now?"
Inception,"01:46:40,942","01:46:42,773",We finish the job before the next kick.
Inception,"01:46:42,944","01:46:45,037",- What next kick? - When the van hits the water.
Inception,"01:47:07,902","01:47:11,338","If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again."
Inception,"01:47:11,506","01:47:13,337","If you need help, hang up..."
Inception,"01:47:13,574","01:47:16,873",How do I drop you without gravity?
Inception,"01:47:19,380","01:47:22,042","Arthur has a couple minutes, and we have about 20."
Inception,"01:47:45,473","01:47:47,134",You okay?
Inception,"01:47:51,612","01:47:55,480",Run! Turn around! Move to base! Move to base!
Inception,"01:47:55,650","01:47:57,174","Go, go, go!"
Inception,"01:47:59,353","01:48:00,513",There's something wrong.
Inception,"01:48:00,688","01:48:03,020","They're heading your way, like they know something."
Inception,"01:48:04,258","01:48:06,488","Just buy us more time, all right?"
Inception,"01:48:06,661","01:48:08,492",- Come on! - On my way.
Inception,"01:48:08,663","01:48:10,358",Come on! Move!
Inception,"01:49:34,549","01:49:36,073",All right.
Inception,"01:49:48,262","01:49:51,060",Okay. That's the antechamber outside the strong room.
Inception,"01:49:51,232","01:49:54,724",- Does the strong room have windows? - It wouldn't be very strong if it did.
Inception,"01:49:54,902","01:49:57,132",Let's hope Fischer likes what he finds in there.
Inception,"01:49:58,773","01:50:02,106",- Are those projections his subconscious? - Yes.
Inception,"01:50:02,276","01:50:05,643",- Are you destroying parts of his mind? - No. They're just projections.
Inception,"01:50:31,939","01:50:33,668","- We're here. - You're clear, but hurry."
Inception,"01:50:33,841","01:50:35,672",There's an entire army headed your way.
Inception,"01:51:02,503","01:51:03,868",I'm in.
Inception,"01:51:09,176","01:51:10,302",There he is.
Inception,"01:51:52,954","01:51:55,650","- There's someone in there. - Fischer, it's a trap. Get out."
Inception,"01:51:56,824","01:51:59,384","Come on. Come on, a little lower."
Inception,"01:52:05,132","01:52:06,292",Cobb.
Inception,"01:52:06,934","01:52:09,459","No, she is not real."
Inception,"01:52:10,071","01:52:11,299",How do you know that?
Inception,"01:52:11,472","01:52:15,101",She is just a projection. Fischer. Fischer is real.
Inception,"01:52:19,113","01:52:20,637",Hello.
Inception,"01:52:25,319","01:52:28,516","Eames! Eames, get to the antechamber now!"
Inception,"01:53:12,433","01:53:15,300",What happened? - Mal killed Fischer.
Inception,"01:53:17,571","01:53:19,596",I couldn't shoot her.
Inception,"01:53:20,274","01:53:23,641",There's no use in reviving him. His mind's already trapped down there.
Inception,"01:53:23,811","01:53:24,869",It's all over.
Inception,"01:53:26,614","01:53:28,241","So that's it, then? We failed?"
Inception,"01:53:28,883","01:53:31,044",We're done. I'm sorry.
Inception,"01:53:34,922","01:53:37,550","It's not me that doesn't get back to my family, is it?"
Inception,"01:53:38,259","01:53:42,161",Shame. I wanted to know what was gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.
Inception,"01:53:42,329","01:53:44,388",Let's set the charges.
Inception,"01:53:46,233","01:53:47,723","No, there's still another way."
Inception,"01:53:49,036","01:53:52,437",- We have to follow Fischer down there. - Not enough time.
Inception,"01:53:52,606","01:53:55,439","No, but there will be enough time down there."
Inception,"01:53:56,577","01:53:57,669",And we will find him.
Inception,"01:53:57,845","01:54:01,781","Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in, just use the defibrillator to revive him."
Inception,"01:54:01,949","01:54:04,850",We can give him his own kick down below.
Inception,"01:54:05,886","01:54:07,581","Look, you get him in there."
Inception,"01:54:07,755","01:54:10,622","As soon as the music ends, you blow up the hospital..."
Inception,"01:54:10,791","01:54:13,589",...and we all ride the kick back up the layers.
Inception,"01:54:14,795","01:54:19,562","It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold the guards off while I set the charges."
Inception,"01:54:19,733","01:54:21,826","Saito will never make it, will he?"
Inception,"01:54:23,137","01:54:26,334","- Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this. - Go for it."
Inception,"01:54:26,507","01:54:29,442","If you are not back before the kick, I am gone with or without you."
Inception,"01:54:29,610","01:54:32,841",She's right. She's right. Come on. Let's go.
Inception,"01:54:37,084","01:54:39,279",Can I trust you to do what needs to happen here?
Inception,"01:54:39,453","01:54:40,647",Mal's gonna be down there.
Inception,"01:54:40,821","01:54:43,255",I know where to find her. She'll have Fischer.
Inception,"01:54:43,424","01:54:47,326",- How do you know? - Because she wants me to come after him.
Inception,"01:54:47,495","01:54:49,656",She wants me back down there with her.
Inception,"01:55:16,423","01:55:17,447",All right?
Inception,"01:55:24,698","01:55:27,360",- This is your world? - It was.
Inception,"01:55:28,169","01:55:30,103",And this is where she'll be.
Inception,"01:55:30,905","01:55:32,395",Come on.
Inception,"01:56:18,886","01:56:21,354",Saito. Saito.
Inception,"01:56:21,789","01:56:25,748","I need you to take care of Fischer while I go set some charges, okay?"
Inception,"01:56:25,926","01:56:29,362",No room for tourists on these jobs.
Inception,"01:56:31,999","01:56:33,159",Don't be silly.
Inception,"01:57:05,666","01:57:07,725",You built all this? This is incredible.
Inception,"01:57:08,202","01:57:10,227",We built for years.
Inception,"01:57:11,272","01:57:13,263",Then we started in on the memories.
Inception,"01:57:20,314","01:57:21,713",This way.
Inception,"01:58:03,390","01:58:05,483",This was our neighborhood.
Inception,"01:58:05,659","01:58:07,991",Places from our past.
Inception,"01:58:08,162","01:58:09,925",That was our first apartment.
Inception,"01:58:10,097","01:58:12,327",Then we moved to that building right there.
Inception,"01:58:12,499","01:58:15,024","After Mal became pregnant, that became our home."
Inception,"01:58:15,202","01:58:18,000",You reconstructed all of this from memory?
Inception,"01:58:18,172","01:58:20,436","Like I told you, we had lots of time."
Inception,"01:58:20,607","01:58:22,199",What is that?
Inception,"01:58:23,744","01:58:25,507",That's the house Mal grew up in.
Inception,"01:58:25,679","01:58:28,113","- Well, will she be in there? - No."
Inception,"01:58:28,449","01:58:29,473",Come on.
Inception,"01:58:29,650","01:58:32,983","We both wanted to live in a house, but we loved this type of building."
Inception,"01:58:33,153","01:58:36,088","In the real world, we'd have to choose, but not here."
Inception,"01:59:16,663","01:59:18,688",How are we gonna bring Fischer back?
Inception,"01:59:19,099","01:59:21,533",We're gonna have to come up with some kind of a kick.
Inception,"01:59:21,702","01:59:23,101",What?
Inception,"01:59:24,104","01:59:25,196",I'm gonna improvise.
Inception,"01:59:25,372","01:59:30,036","Listen, there's something you should know about me. About inception."
Inception,"01:59:43,123","01:59:46,991",An idea is like a virus. Resilient.
Inception,"01:59:47,828","01:59:49,386",Highly contagious.
Inception,"01:59:49,563","01:59:52,896",And the smallest seed of an idea can grow.
Inception,"01:59:53,967","01:59:55,935",It can grow to define...
Inception,"01:59:56,970","01:59:58,528",...or destroy you.
Inception,"02:00:01,675","02:00:04,439","The smallest idea, such as:"
Inception,"02:00:05,045","02:00:07,411","""Your world is not real."""
Inception,"02:00:07,681","02:00:11,447",Simple little thought that changes everything.
Inception,"02:00:12,686","02:00:17,180",So certain of your world. Of what's real.
Inception,"02:00:17,357","02:00:19,154",Do you think he is?
Inception,"02:00:20,961","02:00:23,862",Or do you think he's as lost as I was?
Inception,"02:00:24,998","02:00:26,488","I know what's real, Mal."
Inception,"02:00:28,569","02:00:30,867",No creeping doubts?
Inception,"02:00:31,572","02:00:34,200","Not feeling persecuted, Dom?"
Inception,"02:00:34,508","02:00:35,839",Chased around the globe...
Inception,"02:00:36,009","02:00:38,671",...by anonymous corporations and police forces...
Inception,"02:00:38,846","02:00:41,474",...the way the projections persecute the dreamer?
Inception,"02:00:43,083","02:00:44,573",Admit it.
Inception,"02:00:45,886","02:00:48,719",You don't believe in one reality anymore.
Inception,"02:00:48,889","02:00:50,413",So choose.
Inception,"02:00:50,591","02:00:52,855",Choose to be here.
Inception,"02:00:53,360","02:00:54,850",Choose me.
Inception,"02:01:20,721","02:01:21,983",You know what I have to do.
Inception,"02:01:22,155","02:01:24,817",I have to get back to our children because you left them.
Inception,"02:01:26,159","02:01:27,683",Because you left us.
Inception,"02:01:27,861","02:01:29,658",- You're wrong. I'm not wrong.
Inception,"02:01:29,830","02:01:31,855",You're confused.
Inception,"02:01:32,966","02:01:35,025",Our children are here.
Inception,"02:01:35,802","02:01:39,067","And you'd like to see their faces again, wouldn't you?"
Inception,"02:01:39,239","02:01:42,299","Yes, but I'm gonna see them up above, Mal."
Inception,"02:01:55,956","02:01:57,947",Up above?
Inception,"02:01:58,859","02:02:02,488",Listen to yourself. These are our children.
Inception,"02:02:03,030","02:02:04,395",Watch.
Inception,"02:02:04,898","02:02:06,593",James? Phillipa?
Inception,"02:02:06,767","02:02:09,201","Don't do this, Mal. Please. Those aren't my children."
Inception,"02:02:09,369","02:02:11,837","You keep telling yourself that, but you don't believe it."
Inception,"02:02:12,005","02:02:13,905","- No, I know it. - What if you're wrong?"
Inception,"02:02:14,308","02:02:16,606",What if I'm what's real?
Inception,"02:02:17,811","02:02:20,041",You keep telling yourself what you know.
Inception,"02:02:21,615","02:02:23,845",But what do you believe?
Inception,"02:02:24,818","02:02:26,046",What do you feel?
Inception,"02:02:28,188","02:02:29,621",Guilt.
Inception,"02:02:30,824","02:02:33,054","I feel guilt, Mal."
Inception,"02:02:33,594","02:02:37,530","And no matter what I do, no matter how hopeless I am..."
Inception,"02:02:37,698","02:02:41,964","...no matter how confused, that guilt is always there..."
Inception,"02:02:42,135","02:02:44,660",...reminding me of the truth.
Inception,"02:02:45,172","02:02:46,469",What truth?
Inception,"02:02:48,909","02:02:54,142",That the idea that caused you to question your reality came from me.
Inception,"02:02:57,517","02:03:00,645",You planted the idea in my mind?
Inception,"02:03:02,155","02:03:03,645",What is she talking about?
Inception,"02:03:04,558","02:03:09,825",The reason I knew inception was possible was because I did it to her first.
Inception,"02:03:10,864","02:03:13,833",- I did it to my own wife. - Why?
Inception,"02:03:14,568","02:03:16,058",We were lost in here.
Inception,"02:03:17,004","02:03:21,634","I knew we needed to escape, but she wouldn't accept it."
Inception,"02:03:24,845","02:03:30,511","She had locked something away, something deep inside."
Inception,"02:03:31,284","02:03:35,414","A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget."
Inception,"02:03:36,390","02:03:38,517",And she couldn't break free.
Inception,"02:03:41,228","02:03:43,958",So I decided to search for it.
Inception,"02:03:44,531","02:03:49,400",I went deep into the recess of her mind and found that secret place.
Inception,"02:03:49,569","02:03:51,469",And I broke in...
Inception,"02:03:52,039","02:03:54,200",...and I planted an idea.
Inception,"02:03:54,941","02:03:58,707",A simple little idea that would change everything.
Inception,"02:04:03,950","02:04:06,316",That her world wasn't real.
Inception,"02:04:19,132","02:04:22,329",That death was the only escape.
Inception,"02:04:29,743","02:04:31,506",You're waiting for a train.
Inception,"02:04:33,814","02:04:36,544",A train that'll take you far away.
Inception,"02:04:37,718","02:04:40,710",You know where you hope this train will take you...
Inception,"02:04:41,822","02:04:43,847",...but you can't know for sure.
Inception,"02:04:45,025","02:04:46,549",Yet it doesn't matter.
Inception,"02:04:47,994","02:04:51,157","- Now, tell me why! - Because you'll be together!"
Inception,"02:04:55,502","02:04:59,563",But I never knew that that idea would grow in her mind like a cancer...
Inception,"02:04:59,740","02:05:02,140",...that even after she woke...
Inception,"02:05:05,045","02:05:07,513",That even after you came back to reality...
Inception,"02:05:10,450","02:05:13,419",...that you'd continue to believe your world wasn't real.
Inception,"02:05:16,189","02:05:18,589",That death was the only escape.
Inception,"02:05:18,759","02:05:21,421","Mal, no! Jesus!"
Inception,"02:05:21,595","02:05:25,292",- You infected my mind. - I was trying to save you.
Inception,"02:05:25,465","02:05:26,864",You betrayed me.
Inception,"02:05:27,701","02:05:31,398",But you can make amends. You can still keep your promise.
Inception,"02:05:31,571","02:05:34,597","We can still be together, right here..."
Inception,"02:05:34,775","02:05:37,243",...in the world we built together.
Inception,"02:06:58,058","02:07:00,390","Cobb, we need to get Fischer."
Inception,"02:07:01,261","02:07:02,558",You can't have him.
Inception,"02:07:03,597","02:07:07,033","- If I stay here, will you let him go? - What are you talking about?"
Inception,"02:07:11,504","02:07:13,335",Fischer is on the porch.
Inception,"02:07:13,907","02:07:16,501","- Go check he's alive, Ariadne. - Cobb, you can't do this."
Inception,"02:07:16,676","02:07:19,304",Go check he's alive right now. Do it.
Inception,"02:07:34,961","02:07:38,055","He's here! And it's time, but you have to come now!"
Inception,"02:07:38,231","02:07:41,894","You take Fischer with you, all right? - You can't stay here to be with her."
Inception,"02:07:44,471","02:07:47,167",I'm not. Saito's dead by now.
Inception,"02:07:47,340","02:07:50,832",That means he's down here somewhere. That means I have to find him.
Inception,"02:07:52,846","02:07:55,940","I can't stay with her anymore, because she doesn't exist."
Inception,"02:07:56,116","02:07:59,517",I'm the only thing you do believe in anymore.
Inception,"02:07:59,686","02:08:01,017",No.
Inception,"02:08:02,188","02:08:03,621",I wish.
Inception,"02:08:05,225","02:08:07,716","I wish more than anything, but..."
Inception,"02:08:08,828","02:08:11,558",...I can't imagine you with all your complexity...
Inception,"02:08:11,731","02:08:14,256","...all your perfection, all your imperfection."
Inception,"02:08:15,368","02:08:16,392",- You all right? - Yeah.
Inception,"02:08:16,569","02:08:18,400",Look at you.
Inception,"02:08:19,639","02:08:24,576",You're just a shade. You're just a shade of my real wife.
Inception,"02:08:25,011","02:08:27,639","And you were the best that I could do, but..."
Inception,"02:08:28,481","02:08:30,915","...I'm sorry, you're just not good enough."
Inception,"02:08:31,084","02:08:32,711",Does this feel real?
Inception,"02:08:35,121","02:08:37,715",- What are you doing? - Improvising.
Inception,"02:08:46,333","02:08:48,028","No, no, no!"
Inception,"02:08:49,002","02:08:51,402","In there, now. Go, go, go."
Inception,"02:09:36,249","02:09:38,149",I was dis-
Inception,"02:09:39,853","02:09:42,185",I was dis- Disa-
Inception,"02:09:43,056","02:09:45,581","- I know, Dad. - Dis-"
Inception,"02:09:51,598","02:09:53,691",I know you were disappointed...
Inception,"02:09:54,501","02:09:55,866",...I couldn't be you.
Inception,"02:09:56,269","02:09:57,759",No.
Inception,"02:09:58,271","02:09:59,499","No, no, no."
Inception,"02:10:00,540","02:10:02,531",I was disappointed...
Inception,"02:10:04,277","02:10:06,211",...that you tried.
Inception,"02:10:29,469","02:10:31,130",What?
Inception,"02:10:40,580","02:10:41,706","Come on, come on."
Inception,"02:11:11,945","02:11:13,435",Dad?
Inception,"02:11:51,785","02:11:54,845","That's the kick, Ariadne! You have to go now!"
Inception,"02:12:07,700","02:12:11,136",Don't lose yourself! Find Saito and bring him back!
Inception,"02:12:11,304","02:12:12,965",I will!
Inception,"02:12:52,712","02:12:55,875",You remember when you asked me to marry you?
Inception,"02:12:56,049","02:12:57,141",Yes.
Inception,"02:12:57,317","02:13:00,377",You said you dreamt that we'd grow old together.
Inception,"02:13:03,089","02:13:04,579",But we did.
Inception,"02:13:06,526","02:13:08,892",We did. You don't remember?
Inception,"02:13:13,566","02:13:16,399",I miss you more than I can bear...
Inception,"02:13:18,771","02:13:20,762",...but we had our time together.
Inception,"02:13:22,108","02:13:24,167",And I have to let you go.
Inception,"02:13:26,279","02:13:28,076",I have to let you go.
Inception,"02:14:19,332","02:14:20,629","I'm sorry, Robert."
Inception,"02:14:48,294","02:14:51,957","You know, the will means that Dad wanted me to be my own man..."
Inception,"02:14:53,032","02:14:55,057",...not just to live for him.
Inception,"02:14:56,669","02:14:59,194","That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter."
Inception,"02:15:08,982","02:15:10,210",What happened?
Inception,"02:15:10,683","02:15:12,378",- Cobb stayed. - With Mal?
Inception,"02:15:12,552","02:15:13,814","No, to find Saito."
Inception,"02:15:16,089","02:15:17,852",He'll be lost.
Inception,"02:15:20,393","02:15:22,224","No, he'll be all right."
Inception,"02:15:38,244","02:15:40,212",Have you come to kill me?
Inception,"02:15:44,484","02:15:46,952",I'm waiting for someone.
Inception,"02:15:51,424","02:15:54,188",Someone from a half-remembered dream.
Inception,"02:15:56,929","02:15:58,328",Cobb?
Inception,"02:16:00,266","02:16:02,029",Impossible.
Inception,"02:16:02,568","02:16:05,162",We were young men together.
Inception,"02:16:06,773","02:16:09,105",I'm an old man.
Inception,"02:16:10,343","02:16:12,402",Filled with regret.
Inception,"02:16:15,548","02:16:18,244",Waiting to die alone.
Inception,"02:16:21,421","02:16:23,582",I've come back for you.
Inception,"02:16:26,859","02:16:30,727",To remind you of something.
