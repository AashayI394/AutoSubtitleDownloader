"00:04:40,197","00:04:43,324","No, I'd like to request That it be I who am assigned...."
"00:04:44,534","00:04:49,372",“That it be I who am assigned”? That's confidence-inspiring.

"00:05:00,133","00:05:02,718","Lieutenant Commander Galloway, Here to see Captain West."

"00:05:35,085","00:05:39,088",...entered the barracks room of a PFC William Santiago and assaulted him.
"00:05:39,381","00:05:42,758",Santiago died at the base hospital Approximately an hour later.
"00:05:43,010","00:05:46,387",The NIS agent who took Dawson and Downey's statements...
"00:05:46,555","00:05:48,806",...maintains they were trying to stop Santiago...
"00:05:48,974","00:05:51,642",...from naming Dawson in a fenceline shooting incident.
"00:05:51,810","00:05:56,772",-The hearing's in Cuba at 16:00. -What's the problem?
"00:05:56,940","00:05:59,442",Dawson and Downey are recruiting-poster Marines.
"00:05:59,609","00:06:01,902",Santiago was known to be a screw-up.
"00:06:02,070","00:06:04,739",I was thinking it sounded like a Code Red.
"00:06:05,782","00:06:07,116",Christ!
"00:06:07,284","00:06:10,870","Sir, I'd like to have them moved up to Washington and assigned counsel."
"00:06:11,038","00:06:13,122",Someone who can really look into this.
"00:06:13,290","00:06:15,624",Someone who possesses not only the legal skill...
"00:06:15,834","00:06:18,627",...but a familiarity with the workings of the military.
"00:06:18,795","00:06:23,424","In short, I'd like to suggest that I be the one who that--"
"00:06:23,592","00:06:28,679","That it be me who is assigned to represent them, myself."

"00:06:47,491","00:06:50,159",I thought this Code Red shit wasn't going on anymore.
"00:06:50,327","00:06:53,454","With the Marines at Gitmo, who knows what the hell goes on there?"
"00:06:53,622","00:06:57,458",We'd better find out before the rest of the world does.
"00:06:57,667","00:07:00,169",What about this Commander Galloway?
"00:07:00,337","00:07:05,466",She's been working a desk at Internal Affairs for a little over a year.
"00:07:05,717","00:07:08,469",-Before that? -Disposed of three cases in two years.
"00:07:08,678","00:07:11,347","Three in two years? Who's she handling, the Rosenberg’s?"
"00:07:11,515","00:07:14,016",-She's not a litigator. -She's a hell of an investigator--
"00:07:14,184","00:07:18,687","In Internal Affairs, sure. She can crawl up a lawyer's ass with the best."
"00:07:18,855","00:07:22,858","I know, I know, all passion, no street smarts. Bring her back in."
"00:07:28,532","00:07:29,740",Jo.

"00:07:47,676","00:07:52,138",...to be wasted on a five-minute plea bargain and a week's paperwork.
"00:07:52,305","00:07:55,683","-Sir, there might be more involved. -Don't worry about it."
"00:07:55,892","00:07:58,811",Division will assign the right man for the job.
"00:07:58,979","00:08:01,230","All right, let's go, let's get two!"
"00:08:02,816","00:08:03,816",Sorry.
"00:08:03,984","00:08:07,236","Nothing to be sorry about, Sherby. Look the ball into your glove."
"00:08:07,654","00:08:11,490",-Shooting two. -Sorry.
"00:08:11,700","00:08:16,412","Trust me. Keep your eyes open, your chances of catching increase by 10."
"00:08:16,580","00:08:18,247",-Kaffee. -Let's try it again.
"00:08:18,415","00:08:21,417","-Kaffee! -Dave, you seem distraught."
"00:08:21,585","00:08:23,711",We were supposed to meet 15 minutes ago.
"00:08:23,879","00:08:25,754",You're stalling on the McDermott case.
"00:08:25,922","00:08:30,718","We either get it done now, or I'll hang him from a fucking yardarm!"
"00:08:30,886","00:08:34,763",Do we still hang people? from yardarms?
"00:08:34,931","00:08:36,098",I don't think so.
"00:08:36,558","00:08:39,685",Sherby doesn't think we do that anymore.
"00:08:39,853","00:08:43,105",I'll charge him with possession and being under the influence on duty.
"00:08:43,273","00:08:47,443","You plead guilty, I'll recommend 30 days in the brig."
"00:08:47,611","00:08:52,406",-It was 10 dollars' worth of oregano. -Your client thought it was marijuana.
"00:08:52,574","00:08:55,201",My client's a moron. That's not illegal.
"00:08:55,368","00:08:58,621",I got people to answer to. I'm gonna charge him.
"00:08:58,830","00:09:00,956",With possession of a condiment?
"00:09:01,958","00:09:06,253","I tried to help, but if you ask for jail time, I'll file a motion to dismiss."
"00:09:06,421","00:09:08,297",-You won't get it. -I will get it.
"00:09:08,465","00:09:13,010","If not, I'll file a motion seeking to obtain an evidentiary ruling in advance..."
"00:09:13,303","00:09:15,763",...then I'll file against pre-trial confinement.
"00:09:15,972","00:09:18,307",You'll get three months' paperwork...
"00:09:18,475","00:09:21,977",...because a signalman bought and smoked a dime bag of oregano.
"00:09:22,312","00:09:24,480",Let's go! Let's get two!
"00:09:25,649","00:09:30,402",-Twenty days in the brig. -Fifteen days' restricted duty.
"00:09:31,988","00:09:36,242",-I don't know why I'm agreeing. -You have wisdom beyond your years.
"00:09:40,288","00:09:43,457","-Good morning. -Good morning, captain."
"00:09:43,625","00:09:45,167","How's the baby, Sam?"
"00:09:45,335","00:09:50,047",-She'll say her first word any day now. -How can you tell?
"00:09:50,257","00:09:53,842",She just looks like she has something to say.
"00:09:54,636","00:09:56,512","Excuse me, sorry I'm late."
"00:09:56,680","00:10:00,683","You don't have a good excuse, so I won't force you to tell a bad one."
"00:10:00,850","00:10:05,062","-Thank you, sir. -This first one's for you."
"00:10:05,272","00:10:09,149",You're moving up in the world. You've been requested by Division.
"00:10:10,402","00:10:14,405","-Requested to do what? -Guantánamo Bay, Cuba."
"00:10:14,572","00:10:17,366",A Marine Corporal named Dawson illegally fires a round...
"00:10:17,534","00:10:21,412","...from his weapon, over the fenceline and into Cuba."
"00:10:21,705","00:10:23,455",-What's a fenceline? -Sam.
"00:10:23,873","00:10:27,710",A big wall separating the good guys from the bad guys.
"00:10:27,877","00:10:29,211",Teacher's pet.
"00:10:29,379","00:10:32,298",PFC Santiago threatens to rat on Dawson...
"00:10:32,465","00:10:34,508",...to the Naval Investigative Service.
"00:10:34,676","00:10:38,387","Dawson and another member of his squad, PFC Louden Downey..."
"00:10:38,555","00:10:41,724","...go into Santiago's room, tie him up..."
"00:10:41,891","00:10:44,184",...stuff a rag down his throat...
"00:10:44,352","00:10:46,228","...and an hour later, he's dead."
"00:10:46,396","00:10:50,149",Attending physician says the rag was treated with some kind of toxin.
"00:10:50,317","00:10:52,901",-They poisoned the rag? -Not according to them.
"00:10:53,069","00:10:55,404",-What do they say? -Not much.

"00:11:12,422","00:11:15,257","...was that 06:00 in the morning, sir?"
"00:11:16,468","00:11:21,263","It's important this one go by the book, so I'm assigning co-counsel."
"00:11:21,431","00:11:22,890",Any volunteers?
"00:11:24,100","00:11:25,434",-No. -Sam....
"00:11:25,602","00:11:28,854","-Sir, I got a stack of papers-- -Work with Kaffee on this."

"00:11:37,364","00:11:39,907","In other words, I have no responsibilities?"
"00:11:40,075","00:11:41,200",Right.
"00:11:41,368","00:11:43,494",My kind of case.
"00:11:44,788","00:11:49,249","Right. Right. Okay, but I gotta have that report by Wednesday."
"00:11:55,673","00:11:58,300",-Hi. -Hold on. Hi.
"00:11:58,468","00:12:02,638",Daniel Kaffee. I was told to meet with...
"00:12:08,311","00:12:11,105",...Lieutenant Commander Galloway.
"00:12:13,483","00:12:17,611",-About a briefing. -I'll call you back.
"00:12:19,531","00:12:21,281",You're the attorney Division assigned?
"00:12:22,200","00:12:24,201","I'm lead counsel, this is Sam Weinberg."
"00:12:24,411","00:12:28,622",-I have no responsibilities whatsoever. -Come in. Have a seat.
"00:12:39,175","00:12:44,805",-How long have you been in the Navy? -Going on nine months now.
"00:12:45,557","00:12:48,517",And how long have you been out of law school?
"00:12:48,685","00:12:50,144",Little over a year.
"00:12:50,311","00:12:53,939",-I see. -Have I done something wrong?
"00:12:54,107","00:12:59,445","No. But when I asked for counsel, I was hoping to be taken seriously."
"00:13:00,029","00:13:02,197","No offense taken, in case you were wondering."
"00:13:02,365","00:13:06,368",Lieutenant Kaffee is considered the best litigator in our office.
"00:13:06,536","00:13:09,872",He successfully plea-bargained 44 cases in nine months.
"00:13:10,039","00:13:13,834","-One more, I get a set of steak knives. -Have you ever been in court?"
"00:13:14,002","00:13:16,503",-I once had my license suspended.... -Danny.
"00:13:16,671","00:13:20,716","If this thing goes to court, they won't need a lawyer, they'll need a priest."
"00:13:21,342","00:13:24,386","No, they'll need a lawyer."
"00:13:24,554","00:13:30,017",Dawson's family's been contacted. Downey's closest relative is his aunt.
"00:13:30,185","00:13:32,978","She hasn't been contacted yet, would you like me to do that?"
"00:13:33,146","00:13:34,563","Sure, if you feel like it."
"00:13:36,399","00:13:40,402","One of the people you'll be seeing is the barracks CO, Colonel Jessep."
"00:13:40,570","00:13:42,613",I assume you've heard of him.
"00:13:42,780","00:13:45,199",Who hasn't?
"00:13:45,366","00:13:46,909",He's been in the papers lately.
"00:13:47,076","00:13:48,994",He's expected to be director of operations...
"00:13:49,162","00:13:50,704",...of the National Security Council.
"00:13:50,872","00:13:54,416",-Really? -Here are Santiago's letters from Gitmo.
"00:13:54,584","00:13:57,252",-That's Guantánamo Bay. -I knew that one.
"00:13:57,420","00:13:58,921","He wrote the fleet commander, HQ Atlantic..."
"00:13:59,088","00:14:02,090","...the Marine commandant, even his senator."
"00:14:02,258","00:14:05,552",He wanted to be transferred. No one was listening. Are you with me?
"00:14:05,720","00:14:07,262",Yeah.
"00:14:08,723","00:14:10,933",Finally he wrote the Naval Investigative Service...
"00:14:11,100","00:14:16,563",...where he offered to trade information about Dawson's shooting for a transfer.
"00:14:17,232","00:14:19,274",Right. Is that all?
"00:14:19,442","00:14:23,779",This letter makes it look like your client had a motive to kill Santiago.
"00:14:23,947","00:14:28,784",-Got you. And Santiago is who? -The victim.
"00:14:28,952","00:14:30,285",Write that down.
"00:14:30,453","00:14:34,456",These letters don't paint a flattering picture of Marine Corps life at Gitmo?
"00:14:34,624","00:14:35,958","-Yes, amon-- -And am I right..."
"00:14:36,125","00:14:39,878",...that a protracted investigation might embarrass the Security Council guy?
"00:14:40,046","00:14:42,673",-Colonel Jessep-- -Twelve years.
"00:14:42,840","00:14:43,966",I'm sorry?
"00:14:44,133","00:14:48,053",I'll get them to drop “conspiracy” and “conduct unbecoming.” Twelve years.
"00:14:48,680","00:14:51,723",You haven't talked to a witness or looked at a piece of paper.
"00:14:52,141","00:14:53,892","Pretty impressive, huh?"
"00:14:54,060","00:14:55,644",You'll have to go deeper than that.
"00:14:55,812","00:14:58,480",Do you have some jurisdiction here I should know about?
"00:14:58,648","00:15:01,275",My job is to make sure that you do your job.
"00:15:01,442","00:15:06,822",I'm special counsel for Internal Affairs. So my jurisdiction's in your face.
"00:15:09,075","00:15:12,077",Read the letters. I'll expect a report when you return from Cuba.
"00:15:12,620","00:15:14,830",-Sure. -You're dismissed!
"00:15:17,041","00:15:19,418",I always forget that part.
"00:15:21,337","00:15:23,714",He's a little preoccupied.
"00:15:23,881","00:15:26,842",Team's playing Bethesda Medical next week.
"00:15:27,010","00:15:31,597",Tell your friend not to get cute. Guantánamo Marines are fanatical.
"00:15:31,764","00:15:35,350",-About what? -About being Marines.
"00:15:35,518","00:15:39,313","Dear sir, my name is PFC William T. Santiago."
"00:15:39,480","00:15:41,523",I'm a Marine stationed at Marine barracks...
"00:15:41,691","00:15:45,152","...Rifle Security Company Windward, 2nd Platoon Bravo."
"00:15:45,320","00:15:48,822",l am writing to inform you of my problems here in Cuba...
"00:15:48,990","00:15:50,574",...and to ask for your help.
"00:15:50,742","00:15:56,038","I've fallen out of runs before, because of dizziness or nausea."
"00:15:56,205","00:15:59,791","But on May 18th, I'd fallen back about 20 yards..."
"00:15:59,959","00:16:02,502","...going down a rocky, unstable hill."
"00:16:02,670","00:16:05,422",My sergeant grabbed me and pushed me down the hill...
"00:16:05,590","00:16:09,426",...then I saw all black and the last thing I remember is hitting the deck.
"00:16:09,636","00:16:12,846",I was brought to the hospital. They said it was heat exhaustion.
"00:16:13,014","00:16:18,101","I ask you to help me. Please, l need a transfer out of RSC."
"00:16:18,269","00:16:22,689","Sincerely, PFC William T. Santiago, U.S. Marine Corps."
"00:16:22,857","00:16:26,860","P.S. In exchange for my transfer, I'm willing to provide you...."
"00:16:27,028","00:16:32,074",“--with information about an illegal fenceline shooting on August 2nd.”
"00:16:33,076","00:16:37,371",Who the fuck is PFC William T. Santiago?
"00:16:37,580","00:16:40,582","Private Santiago's a member of 2nd Platoon Bravo, sir."
"00:16:40,750","00:16:44,920",Yeah. Apparently he's not very happy down here at Shangri-la...
"00:16:45,088","00:16:49,925","...because he's written everybody but Santa Claus, asking for a transfer."
"00:16:50,093","00:16:55,597",Now he's telling tales about a fenceline shooting. Matthew?
"00:16:56,057","00:17:01,478","-I'm appalled, sir. -You're appalled."
"00:17:02,563","00:17:05,941",This kid broke the chain of command and ratted on a member of his unit...
"00:17:06,109","00:17:09,319",...to say nothing of the fact that he's a U.S. Marine...
"00:17:09,487","00:17:14,616",...and it would appear he can't run from here to there without collapsing.
"00:17:14,784","00:17:17,953","What the fuck is going on in Bravo company, Matthew?"
"00:17:18,121","00:17:21,039","Colonel, I think it would be better to discuss it in private."
"00:17:21,207","00:17:25,252","That won't be necessary. I can handle this situation, sir."
"00:17:25,420","00:17:27,754","-Like you handled Curtis Bell? -Sir, your methods--"
"00:17:27,922","00:17:30,590","Don't interrupt me, lieutenant, I'm your superior!"
"00:17:30,758","00:17:32,634","And I'm yours, Matthew."
"00:17:34,637","00:17:37,889",I wanna know what we're going to do about this.
"00:17:38,057","00:17:40,892",I think Santiago should be transferred immediately.
"00:17:41,060","00:17:42,644",He's that bad?
"00:17:42,812","00:17:46,815","And word of this letter will get out, and he'll get his ass whipped."
"00:17:48,609","00:17:52,779",Transfer Santiago? Yes.
"00:17:52,947","00:17:57,075","Sure, you're right. I'm sure that's the thing to do."
"00:17:58,828","00:18:02,831","Wait. Wait, I've got a better idea."
"00:18:02,999","00:18:06,793",Let's transfer the whole squad off the base. Let's....
"00:18:06,961","00:18:09,004","On second thought, Windward."
"00:18:09,172","00:18:13,300",Let's transfer the whole Windward division off the base.
"00:18:13,468","00:18:18,722","Jon, go get those boys off the fence. They're packing their bags."
"00:18:18,890","00:18:21,433",-Tom! -Sir?
"00:18:21,601","00:18:23,477",Get me the president on the phone.
"00:18:23,644","00:18:26,271",We're surrendering our position in Cuba.
"00:18:26,439","00:18:28,774","-Yes, sir. -Wait a minute, Tom."
"00:18:28,941","00:18:34,696",Don't get the president yet. Maybe we should consider this for a second.
"00:18:34,864","00:18:36,823","-Dismissed, Tom. -Yes, sir."
"00:18:38,201","00:18:41,870",Maybe-- And I'm just spit-balling here.
"00:18:42,038","00:18:46,875",Maybe we have a responsibility as officers to train Santiago.
"00:18:47,084","00:18:51,338","Maybe we, as officers, have a responsibility to this country..."
"00:18:51,506","00:18:54,925",...to see that the men and women charged with its security...
"00:18:55,092","00:18:56,885",...are trained professionals.
"00:18:57,053","00:19:00,722","Yes, I'm certain that I read that somewhere once."
"00:19:00,890","00:19:03,475","And now I'm thinking, Colonel Markinson..."
"00:19:03,643","00:19:07,729",...that your suggestion of transferring Santiago...
"00:19:07,897","00:19:11,107",...while expeditious and certainly painless...
"00:19:11,317","00:19:16,613","...might not be, in a manner of speaking, the American way."
"00:19:16,823","00:19:21,076",Santiago stays where he is.
"00:19:21,244","00:19:26,456","We're gonna train the lad. Jon, you're in charge."
"00:19:26,624","00:19:33,421","Santiago doesn't make 4.6, 4.6 on his next proficiency report..."
"00:19:33,589","00:19:35,924",...I'm going to blame you.
"00:19:36,092","00:19:38,552","-Then I'm going to kill you. -Yes, sir."
"00:19:38,928","00:19:41,221","I think that's a mistake, colonel."
"00:19:42,765","00:19:46,935","Matthew, I think I will have that word in private with you now."
"00:19:47,103","00:19:50,772","Jon, that's all. Why don't we meet at the “O” Club and have lunch..."
"00:19:50,940","00:19:53,650",...and we'll talk about the training of young William.
"00:19:53,860","00:19:56,528",I'd be delighted to hear your suggestions.
"00:19:56,696","00:19:58,405",Dismissed.
"00:20:02,243","00:20:05,287","Matthew, sit down. Please."
"00:20:10,793","00:20:14,963",-What do you think of Kendrick? -I don't think my opinion of Kendrick--
"00:20:15,131","00:20:18,300",I think he's pretty much of a weasel myself.
"00:20:18,467","00:20:20,260",But he's an awfully good officer...
"00:20:20,428","00:20:24,764","...and in the end, we see eye to eye on the best way to run a Marine unit."
"00:20:24,974","00:20:28,310","We're in the business of saving lives, Matthew."
"00:20:28,477","00:20:32,147",That is a responsibility that we have to take pretty seriously.
"00:20:32,315","00:20:36,526",And I believe that taking a Marine who is not up to the job...
"00:20:36,694","00:20:41,156",...and shipping him off to another assignment puts lives in danger.
"00:20:41,991","00:20:44,159","Sit down, Matthew."
"00:20:53,794","00:20:55,921",We go back a while.
"00:20:56,088","00:20:58,214",We went to the Academy together...
"00:20:58,382","00:21:01,843","...were commissioned together, did our tours in Vietnam together."
"00:21:02,428","00:21:07,974",But I've been promoted with greater speed and success than you.
"00:21:08,142","00:21:12,145","Now, if that's a source of tension or embarrassment for you..."
"00:21:12,313","00:21:14,189",...I don't give a shit.
"00:21:14,357","00:21:19,569","We're in the business of saving lives, Lieutenant Colonel Markinson."
"00:21:19,737","00:21:23,615",Don't ever question my orders in front of another officer.
"00:21:43,594","00:21:48,890",All the paperwork's in order. Step over there.
"00:21:52,770","00:21:56,815","-Hal, is this Washington D.C.? -All right, let's move."
"00:21:56,983","00:21:58,775","Yes, sir."
"00:22:05,992","00:22:07,450",Got all of that one.
"00:22:07,618","00:22:12,205",Excuse me. I wanted to talk to you about Dawson and Downey.
"00:22:12,373","00:22:16,126",-Say again? -Dawson and Downey.
"00:22:16,293","00:22:18,169","The names seem familiar, but...."
"00:22:18,421","00:22:21,047",Dawson. Downey. Your clients?
"00:22:21,215","00:22:24,426","The Cuba thing! Yes! Oh, Dawson and Downey. Right."
"00:22:27,263","00:22:29,681","I've done something wrong again, haven't I?"
"00:22:29,849","00:22:34,602",I was wondering why they're locked up while their lawyer's out hitting a ball.
"00:22:36,772","00:22:39,941",-We need the practice. -That wasn't funny.
"00:22:40,693","00:22:42,068",It was a little funny.
"00:22:42,236","00:22:47,490","Lieutenant, would you be very insulted if I recommended different counsel?"
"00:22:47,658","00:22:50,952",-Why? -I don't think you're fit to handle it.
"00:22:51,579","00:22:57,459",You don't even know me. Ordinarily it takes someone hours to find that out.
"00:22:59,670","00:23:02,589","Oh, come on. That was damn funny."
"00:23:05,593","00:23:09,846",You're wrong. I do know you.
"00:23:10,056","00:23:13,475","Daniel Alistair Kaffee, born June 8th, 1964..."
"00:23:13,642","00:23:15,602",...at Boston Mercy Hospital.
"00:23:15,770","00:23:20,523","Your father's Lionel Kaffee, former Attorney General of the U.S..."
"00:23:20,691","00:23:22,317",...died 1985.
"00:23:22,568","00:23:25,320","You went to Harvard Law, then joined the Navy..."
"00:23:25,488","00:23:27,989",...probably because that's what your father wanted.
"00:23:28,157","00:23:31,785",Now you're just treading water for the three years in the JAG corps...
"00:23:31,952","00:23:34,954",...just laying low till you can get out and get a real job.
"00:23:35,122","00:23:38,583","If that's the situation, that's fine, I won't tell anyone."
"00:23:38,751","00:23:43,713","But if this case is handled in the same fast-food, slick-assed manner..."
"00:23:43,881","00:23:45,799",...with which you handle everything else...
"00:23:45,966","00:23:47,550",...then something's gonna get missed.
"00:23:47,718","00:23:52,889",And I wouldn't be doing my job if I let Dawson and Downey to sit in prison...
"00:23:53,099","00:23:57,519",...because their attorney predetermined the path of least resistance.
"00:24:01,398","00:24:04,025","I'm sexually aroused, commander."
"00:24:04,693","00:24:06,945",I don't think your clients murdered anyone.
"00:24:07,113","00:24:10,365",-What are you basing this on? -There was no intent.
"00:24:10,533","00:24:13,243",Doctor's report says Santiago died of asphyxiation...
"00:24:13,410","00:24:15,078",...from acute lactic acidosis...
"00:24:15,246","00:24:18,915",...and the nature of the acidosis strongly suggests poisoning.
"00:24:19,083","00:24:21,960","Now, I don't know what that means, but it sounds bad."
"00:24:22,128","00:24:26,673","Santiago died at 1 a.m. At 3, the doctor didn't know the reason."
"00:24:26,841","00:24:29,050","Two hours later, he said it was poison."
"00:24:29,218","00:24:31,553","Oh, now I see what you're saying."
"00:24:31,720","00:24:35,056","It had to be Professor Plum, in the library, with the candlestick."
"00:24:35,224","00:24:37,559",I'm gonna talk to your supervisor.
"00:24:37,726","00:24:42,397",Go straight up Pennsylvania Avenue. It's the big white house with the pillars.
"00:24:42,982","00:24:45,316",-Thank you. -I don't think you'll have much luck.
"00:24:45,484","00:24:50,238",I was assigned by Division. Somebody thinks I'm a good lawyer.
"00:24:50,406","00:24:56,411","So, while I appreciate your interest and enthusiasm, I think I can handle things."
"00:24:56,579","00:24:58,580",You know what a Code Red is?
"00:25:02,751","00:25:04,586",What a pity.
"00:25:15,014","00:25:17,098","-Morning, sir. -Morning."
"00:25:18,100","00:25:20,310","Officer on deck, ten-hut!"
"00:25:20,477","00:25:22,312","Lance Corporal Harold Dawson, sir!"
"00:25:22,479","00:25:25,064",Rifle Security Company Windward! Second Platoon Bravo!
"00:25:25,232","00:25:27,692",You haven't been working and playing well with others.
"00:25:27,860","00:25:29,777","Sir! Yes, sir!"
"00:25:31,572","00:25:35,158","Sir! PFC Louden Downey, sir!"
"00:25:35,326","00:25:39,120","I'm Daniel Kaffee, this is Sam Weinberg. Sit down."
"00:25:46,503","00:25:49,047","-Is this your signature? -Yes, sir."
"00:25:49,215","00:25:51,132",Don't have to call me sir. Is this yours?
"00:25:51,300","00:25:55,470","-Sir, yes, sir! -Certainly don't need to say it twice."
"00:25:55,638","00:25:58,932",-What's a Code Red? -It's a disciplinary engagement.
"00:25:59,099","00:26:00,475",What's that mean exactly?
"00:26:00,643","00:26:04,437","A Marine falls out of line, it's up to his unit to get him on track."
"00:26:04,730","00:26:07,982",-What's a garden-variety Code Red? -Sir?
"00:26:08,150","00:26:14,489","Harold, You say “sir” and I look for my father. Danny, Daniel Kaffee."
"00:26:14,657","00:26:17,784",Garden-variety. Typical. What's a basic Code Red?
"00:26:17,952","00:26:23,164","A Marine refuses to bathe, the men give him a GI shower."
"00:26:23,332","00:26:27,085","-What's that? -Scrub brushes, steel wool."
"00:26:27,253","00:26:28,503",Beautiful.
"00:26:28,671","00:26:31,089",Was the attack on Santiago a Code Red?
"00:26:31,632","00:26:32,840","Yes, sir."
"00:26:38,264","00:26:41,266",Does he ever talk?
"00:26:41,433","00:26:46,271","Sir, PFC Downey will answer any direct questions you ask him."
"00:26:48,148","00:26:51,859","Private Downey, the rag you put in his mouth, was there poison on it?"
"00:26:52,027","00:26:55,238","-No, sir. -Silver polish, turpentine, antifreeze?"
"00:26:55,406","00:26:57,657","No, sir. We were just gonna shave his head."
"00:26:57,825","00:27:00,243","When, all of the sudden...."
"00:27:00,869","00:27:03,830",We saw blood dripping down his mouth.
"00:27:03,998","00:27:07,375","We pulled the tape off and there was blood all down his face, sir."
"00:27:07,543","00:27:10,586",That's when Lance Corporal Dawson called the ambulance.
"00:27:10,796","00:27:15,550","-Did anyone see you call it? -No, sir."
"00:27:18,220","00:27:22,265","-Were you there when it arrived? -Yes, that's when we were arrested."
"00:27:22,433","00:27:28,479","On August 2nd, did you fire a shot across the fenceline, into Cuba?"
"00:27:29,273","00:27:30,481","-Yes, sir. -Why?"
"00:27:30,649","00:27:33,359","-My mirror engaged, sir. -His “mirror”?"
"00:27:33,527","00:27:37,280","For every American sentry, there's a Cuban counterpart. Called “mirrors.”"
"00:27:37,448","00:27:40,825",Lance corporal claims his mirror was about to fire at him.
"00:27:40,993","00:27:46,039",Santiago's letter to the NIS said you fired illegally.
"00:27:46,206","00:27:51,586","He's saying the guy, the mirror, he never made a move."
"00:27:55,382","00:28:00,595","Oh, Harold? You see what I'm getting at?"
"00:28:00,763","00:28:02,597",If Santiago didn't have anything on you...
"00:28:02,765","00:28:04,265",...why did you give him a Code Red?
"00:28:04,433","00:28:07,602","-He broke the chain of command, sir. -He what?"
"00:28:07,770","00:28:09,729",He went outside of his unit.
"00:28:09,897","00:28:14,233","If he had a problem, he should have spoken to me, then his sergeant, then--"
"00:28:14,401","00:28:17,904","All right, all right. Did you assault Santiago with intent to kill?"
"00:28:18,072","00:28:19,614","-No, sir. -What was your intent?"
"00:28:19,782","00:28:22,408","-To train him, sir. -Train him to do what?"
"00:28:22,743","00:28:27,038",To think of his unit before himself. To respect the code.
"00:28:27,206","00:28:30,958","-What's the code? -Unit, Corps, God, country!"
"00:28:31,293","00:28:37,256","-I beg your pardon? -Unit, Corps, God, country, sir."
"00:28:53,440","00:28:59,487",The government of the United States wants to charge you two with murder.
"00:28:59,655","00:29:05,076","And you want me to tell the prosecutor, “unit, Corps, God, country”?"
"00:29:05,244","00:29:07,161","That's our code, sir."
"00:29:11,166","00:29:13,000",-That's your code. -That's your code.
"00:29:13,168","00:29:15,711",We'll be back.
"00:29:15,921","00:29:19,632",You need anything? Books? Papers? Cigarettes? Ham sandwich?
"00:29:19,800","00:29:21,926","Sir! No, thank you, sir!"
"00:29:22,386","00:29:25,805","Harold, there's a concept you'd better start warming up to."
"00:29:25,973","00:29:29,809",-Sir? -I'm the only friend you've got.
"00:29:43,449","00:29:46,200",-Dan Kaffee. -Smiling Jack Ross.
"00:29:46,368","00:29:48,536",-Welcome to the big time. -You think so?
"00:29:48,704","00:29:52,457",Let's hope you practice law better than you play softball.
"00:29:52,624","00:29:55,877","Unfortunately, I don't do anything better than I play softball."
"00:29:56,044","00:29:58,880","I'm out of here, Jannelle! See you when I get back from Cuba."
"00:29:59,047","00:30:02,300",-Say hi to Castro for me. -Will do. What're we looking at?
"00:30:02,468","00:30:05,553","They plead guilty, we drop “conspiracy” and “conduct unbecoming”..."
"00:30:05,721","00:30:07,388","...20 years, they're home in half."
"00:30:07,556","00:30:13,561",-Twelve. They called the ambulance. -I don't care. They killed a Marine.
"00:30:13,729","00:30:17,857","The rag was tested for poison. The autopsy says maybe, maybe not."
"00:30:18,025","00:30:22,403",The Chief of Internal Medicine at Guantánamo says he's sure.
"00:30:22,571","00:30:27,617","-What do you know about Code Reds? -Oh, man...."
"00:30:28,410","00:30:32,246",-Are we off the record? -You tell me.
"00:30:32,414","00:30:34,248",I'm gonna give you the 12 years.
"00:30:34,416","00:30:37,251","But before you get into trouble tomorrow, you should know..."
"00:30:37,419","00:30:41,047","...the platoon commander, Kendrick, held a meeting with the men..."
"00:30:41,215","00:30:45,551",...and specifically told them not to touch Santiago.
"00:30:47,721","00:30:50,598",-We still playing hoops tomorrow? -Do we have a deal?
"00:30:51,600","00:30:53,392",I'll talk to you when I get back.
"00:30:56,813","00:30:58,105",Hi there.
"00:30:58,273","00:30:59,982",Any luck getting me replaced?
"00:31:00,150","00:31:03,444",Is there anyone in this command you don't drink or play softball with?
"00:31:03,612","00:31:06,447","Listen, I came to make peace. We got off on the wrong foot."
"00:31:06,615","00:31:09,075","-What do you say, friends? -Look, I don't--"
"00:31:09,243","00:31:12,578",I brought Downey some comic books he was asking for.
"00:31:12,746","00:31:16,624","The kid, I swear, doesn't even know why he's been arrested."
"00:31:16,792","00:31:19,794",-Commander-- -You can call me JoAnne. Or Jo.
"00:31:19,962","00:31:21,254",-Jo? -Yes.
"00:31:21,421","00:31:24,382","Jo, if you speak to a client of mine again without permission..."
"00:31:24,550","00:31:27,134",...I'll have you disbarred. Friends?
"00:31:27,302","00:31:30,179",-I had authorization. -From where?
"00:31:30,347","00:31:35,518","Downey's closest relative, Ginny Miller, his aunt on his mother's side."
"00:31:35,686","00:31:38,145",You got authorization from Aunt Ginny?
"00:31:38,313","00:31:40,064","I gave her a call, like you asked."
"00:31:40,232","00:31:42,275",Very nice woman. We spoke for an hour.
"00:31:42,442","00:31:45,319",You got authorization from Aunt Ginny.
"00:31:45,487","00:31:47,697",Perfectly within my province.
"00:31:47,864","00:31:50,575",Does Aunt Ginny have a barn? We could hold the trial there.
"00:31:50,742","00:31:54,996","I can sew the costumes, Uncle Goober can be the judge."
"00:31:57,207","00:32:00,501",I'm going to Cuba with you tomorrow.
"00:32:01,878","00:32:05,339",And the hits just keep on coming.
"00:32:27,738","00:32:31,198","-How's it going, Luther? -Another day, another dollar."
"00:32:31,366","00:32:34,368",-Gotta play them as they lay. -What goes around comes around.
"00:32:34,536","00:32:37,788","-Can't beat them, join them. -At least I got my health."
"00:32:38,206","00:32:41,626","Well, you got everything. See you tomorrow, Luther."
"00:32:41,793","00:32:44,712",Not if I see you first.
"00:32:46,048","00:32:50,343",You're my witness. The baby spoke. My daughter said a word.
"00:32:50,510","00:32:52,887",She made a sound. I'm not sure it was a word.
"00:32:53,055","00:32:57,433",-Come on! It was definitely a word. -Okay.
"00:32:57,643","00:33:02,730",You heard her. She pointed and said “Pa.” She did.
"00:33:02,898","00:33:05,608",-She was pointing at a mailbox. -That's right.
"00:33:05,776","00:33:09,445","Pointing as if to say, “Pa! Look, a mailbox.”"
"00:33:16,411","00:33:20,831","-Jack Ross offered me the 12 years. -That's what you wanted, right?"
"00:33:20,999","00:33:23,250","I know, and I'll...."
"00:33:23,418","00:33:30,549","-I mean, I guess I'll take it. -So..?"
"00:33:30,717","00:33:33,761",It took about 45 seconds. He barely put up a fight.
"00:33:33,929","00:33:37,765","Danny, take the 12 years, it's a gift."
"00:33:37,933","00:33:39,767","You don't believe their story, do you?"
"00:33:39,935","00:33:42,103",You think they ought to go to jail for life.
"00:33:42,270","00:33:44,146",I believe every word of their story...
"00:33:44,314","00:33:48,192",...and I think they ought to go to jail for life.
"00:33:52,614","00:33:54,782",-See you tomorrow. -Okay.
"00:33:54,950","00:33:57,451",Don't forget to wear the whites. Very hot.
"00:33:57,619","00:33:59,078",I don't like the whites.
"00:33:59,287","00:34:02,832","Nobody does, but we're going to Cuba. You got Dramamine?"
"00:34:02,999","00:34:07,962","-Dramamine keeps you cool? -No, it keeps you from getting airsick."
"00:34:08,130","00:34:13,050",I get airsick because I'm afraid of crashing. Dramamine won't help.
"00:34:14,094","00:34:16,470","I got some oregano, I hear that works pretty good."
"00:34:20,016","00:34:24,186",Ross said the strangest thing to me right before I left.
"00:34:24,354","00:34:26,313",He said Lieutenant Kendrick...
"00:34:26,481","00:34:30,317",...had told the men specifically not to touch Santiago.
"00:34:30,736","00:34:36,407",-So? -I don't even know who Kendrick is.
"00:34:39,453","00:34:43,164",What the hell. I'll see you tomorrow.
"00:35:19,201","00:35:25,915","I'm Corporal Barnes, I'm to escort you to the Windward side of the base."
"00:35:26,082","00:35:29,543","I got some camouflage jackets, I suggest you both put them on."
"00:35:29,711","00:35:31,045",Camouflage jackets?
"00:35:31,213","00:35:34,381","Yes, sir. We'll be riding pretty close to the fenceline."
"00:35:34,549","00:35:40,554","If the Cubans see an officer in white, they might take a shot."
"00:35:40,722","00:35:43,349","Good call, Sam."
"00:35:48,021","00:35:50,564",We'll just hop on the ferry. We'll be there in no time.
"00:35:50,732","00:35:54,860","-Hold it. We gotta take a boat? -Yes, sir, to get across the bay."
"00:35:55,028","00:35:57,988","-No one said anything about a boat. -Is there a problem, sir?"
"00:35:58,156","00:36:01,909","No, no problem, I'm just not that crazy about boats."
"00:36:02,077","00:36:06,205","Jesus Christ, Kaffee, you're in the Navy, for crying out loud!"
"00:36:06,373","00:36:09,583","-Nobody likes her very much. -Yes, sir."
"00:36:22,931","00:36:26,725","-Nathan Jessep. Come on in. -Thank you, sir."
"00:36:26,893","00:36:29,895","Daniel Kaffee, I'm the attorney for Dawson and Downey."
"00:36:30,063","00:36:32,106",This is Lt. Commander JoAnne Galloway.
"00:36:32,274","00:36:33,440",Pleasure meeting you.
"00:36:33,608","00:36:37,987","Observing and evaluating. Lieutenant Weinberg, my assistant."
"00:36:38,154","00:36:41,949","This is XO, Colonel Markinson, and Platoon Leader Lt. Kendrick."
"00:36:42,117","00:36:44,618","I've asked them to join us. Sit down, please."
"00:36:44,786","00:36:47,329",-Lieutenant Kaffee. -Colonel Markinson.
"00:36:47,497","00:36:49,665",I had the pleasure of meeting your father once.
"00:36:49,833","00:36:51,876",I was a teenager. He spoke at my high school.
"00:36:52,794","00:36:55,337","-Lionel Kaffee? -Yes, sir."
"00:36:55,505","00:36:56,881","Well, what do you know?"
"00:36:57,340","00:37:01,552","Jon, this man's dad once made a lot of enemies in your neck of the woods."
"00:37:01,720","00:37:05,431",Jefferson v. Madison County School District.
"00:37:05,599","00:37:09,810",Folks down there said a little black girl couldn't go to an all-white school.
"00:37:09,978","00:37:13,814","Lionel Kaffee said, “We'll just see about that.”"
"00:37:14,316","00:37:18,903","-How the hell is your dad, Danny? -He passed away seven years ago."
"00:37:20,947","00:37:24,909","-Don't I feel like the fucking asshole. -Not at all, sir."
"00:37:26,286","00:37:31,790","-What can we do for you, Danny? -Not much, sir."
"00:37:31,958","00:37:36,503",This is really a formality more than anything else.
"00:37:36,671","00:37:39,465",JAG Corps insist we interview all the relevant witnesses.
"00:37:39,633","00:37:42,676",The JAG Corps can be demanding that way.
"00:37:43,470","00:37:48,182","Jon'll show you what you want to see. After that, we can meet for lunch."
"00:37:48,350","00:37:50,559","-How does that sound? -Fine, sir."
"00:37:59,986","00:38:04,698",You met with the men that afternoon. What did you guys talk about?
"00:38:04,866","00:38:06,951",I told them we had an informer among us...
"00:38:07,118","00:38:10,079","...and that, despite any desire they had for retribution..."
"00:38:10,246","00:38:13,874",...Private Santiago was not to be harmed in any way.
"00:38:14,042","00:38:17,670",-What time was that meeting? -1600.
"00:38:17,837","00:38:19,546",That's 4:00.
"00:39:11,433","00:39:14,101",We should make sure somebody gets this to his parents.
"00:39:14,269","00:39:17,104",-We don't need it anymore. -Right.
"00:39:18,606","00:39:22,776","-Lt. Kendrick, may I call you Jon? -No, you may not."
"00:39:22,944","00:39:27,197","-Have I done something to offend you? -No, I like all you Navy boys."
"00:39:27,365","00:39:31,285","Every time we gotta go fight, you fellas always give us a ride."
"00:39:32,871","00:39:36,081","Lieutenant Kendrick, do you think Santiago was murdered?"
"00:39:36,249","00:39:41,295","I believe in God and Jesus Christ. Because I do, I can say this:"
"00:39:41,463","00:39:44,965","Private Santiago is dead, and that is a tragedy."
"00:39:45,133","00:39:47,176",But he is dead because he had no code...
"00:39:47,343","00:39:51,597",...and no honor. And God was watching.
"00:39:54,267","00:39:58,145",-How do you feel about that theory? -Sounds good. Let's move on.
"00:39:58,313","00:40:03,859","Are you planning on investigating, or you just gonna take the guided tour?"
"00:40:04,069","00:40:06,653",I'm pacing myself.
"00:40:06,946","00:40:12,326",They were running around for hours looking for anything white to wave.
"00:40:12,494","00:40:16,830",Some of these people surrendered to a crew from CNN.
"00:40:16,998","00:40:23,545","Walk softly and carry an armoured tank division, I always say."
"00:40:23,713","00:40:26,632","-That was delicious. Thank you. -My pleasure, sir."
"00:40:26,800","00:40:31,512","Colonel, I do have to ask you a couple questions about September 6th."
"00:40:31,679","00:40:33,180",Shoot.
"00:40:33,348","00:40:39,978",An NIS agent told you that Santiago tipped him off to a fenceline shooting.
"00:40:40,146","00:40:43,190",Santiago was gonna reveal who did it in exchange for a transfer.
"00:40:43,358","00:40:45,526",Yes.
"00:40:47,821","00:40:53,700","If you feel there are any details that I'm missing, feel free to speak up."
"00:40:56,371","00:40:58,038",Thank you.
"00:41:01,543","00:41:03,919",You called Lt. Colonel Markinson...
"00:41:04,087","00:41:07,005",...and Lt. Kendrick into your office. Is that right?
"00:41:07,173","00:41:09,508",-Yes. -And what happened then?
"00:41:09,676","00:41:15,389","We agreed that, for his own safety, Santiago should be transferred."
"00:41:16,057","00:41:19,518",Santiago was set to be transferred?
"00:41:19,686","00:41:24,356",On the first flight to the States. 06:00 the next morning.
"00:41:24,941","00:41:28,527","Five hours too late, as it turned out."
"00:41:29,863","00:41:35,242","Yeah. All right, that's all. Thanks very much for your time."
"00:41:35,410","00:41:38,537",The corporal's waiting outside with a jeep. He'll take you back.
"00:41:38,705","00:41:41,498","-Wait, I've got some questions. -No, you don't."
"00:41:41,666","00:41:43,792","-Yes, I do. -No, you don't."
"00:41:43,960","00:41:49,089","On the morning Santiago died, did you meet with Dr. Stone?"
"00:41:49,257","00:41:55,762",-Of course. One of my men was dead. -You see? The man was dead. Let's go.
"00:41:55,930","00:42:02,561","-Have you heard the term Code Red? -I've heard the term, yes."
"00:42:02,770","00:42:05,480","This past February, you received a memo..."
"00:42:05,648","00:42:08,192",...from the Atlantic Fleet commander...
"00:42:08,359","00:42:11,486",...warning that enlisted men disciplining their own...
"00:42:11,654","00:42:13,238",...wasn't to be condoned.
"00:42:13,406","00:42:16,158",I submit to you that whoever wrote that memo...
"00:42:16,326","00:42:22,122",...has never faced the working end of a Cuban AK-47 assault rifle.
"00:42:22,290","00:42:25,792","However, the directive, having come from the commander..."
"00:42:25,960","00:42:27,753",...I gave it its due attention.
"00:42:27,921","00:42:29,254","What is your point, Jo?"
"00:42:29,422","00:42:34,092","She has no point, it's part of her charm. We're out of here. Thank you."
"00:42:34,260","00:42:39,806",My point is that I think Code Reds still go on. Do they?
"00:42:39,974","00:42:42,309","-He doesn't need to answer that. -Yes, he does."
"00:42:42,518","00:42:46,021","-No, he really doesn't. -Yeah, he really does."
"00:42:47,774","00:42:48,982",Colonel?
"00:42:50,610","00:42:53,737","You know, it just hit me."
"00:42:53,905","00:42:57,699","-She outranks you, Danny. -Yes, sir."
"00:42:57,867","00:43:01,245","I want to tell you something. And listen up, because I mean this."
"00:43:01,412","00:43:04,331",You're the luckiest man in the world.
"00:43:04,499","00:43:08,335","There is nothing on this earth sexier-- Believe me, gentlemen."
"00:43:08,503","00:43:11,505",--than a woman you have to salute in the morning.
"00:43:12,173","00:43:15,467","Promote them all, I say, because this is true."
"00:43:15,635","00:43:20,138","If you haven't gotten a blowjob from a superior officer, well..."
"00:43:20,306","00:43:23,183",...you're just letting the best in life pass you by.
"00:43:24,435","00:43:28,063","The practice of Code Reds is still condoned on this base, isn't it?"
"00:43:28,273","00:43:31,483","My problem is I'm a colonel, so I'll just have to take cold showers..."
"00:43:31,651","00:43:34,194",...until they elect some gal president.
"00:43:34,904","00:43:36,697","I need an answer to my question, sir."
"00:43:36,864","00:43:40,367","Take caution in your tone, commander."
"00:43:40,535","00:43:46,665","I'm a fair guy, but this fucking heat is making me absolutely crazy."
"00:43:47,542","00:43:49,293",You wanna ask me about Code Reds?
"00:43:49,460","00:43:52,045","On the record, I discourage the practice..."
"00:43:52,213","00:43:54,214",...in accordance with the directive.
"00:43:54,382","00:43:59,428","Off the record, I tell you it is an invaluable part of infantry training."
"00:43:59,595","00:44:06,393","If it goes on without my knowledge, so be it. That's how I run my unit."
"00:44:06,561","00:44:11,064","You want to investigate me, roll the dice and take your chances."
"00:44:11,232","00:44:15,610",I eat breakfast 300 yards from 4000 Cubans who are trained to kill me.
"00:44:15,778","00:44:20,741","So don't think for one second that you can come down here, flash a badge..."
"00:44:20,908","00:44:23,285",...and make me nervous.
"00:44:27,915","00:44:29,624",Let's go.
"00:44:32,045","00:44:35,505","Colonel, I'll just need a copy of Santiago's transfer order."
"00:44:35,923","00:44:37,174",What's that?
"00:44:37,342","00:44:40,594",Santiago's transfer order. You guys have paperwork on it.
"00:44:40,762","00:44:42,387",I just need it for the file.
"00:44:42,555","00:44:45,432",-For the file? -Yeah.
"00:44:47,560","00:44:51,938",Of course you can have a copy of the transfer order for the file.
"00:44:52,106","00:44:55,275",-I'm here to help in any way I can. -Thank you.
"00:44:55,443","00:44:57,027","You believe that, don't you, Danny?"
"00:44:57,195","00:44:59,363",That I'm here to help you any way I can?
"00:45:00,365","00:45:01,698",Of course.
"00:45:02,450","00:45:07,120",The corporal will take you by Personnel on your way to the flight line...
"00:45:07,288","00:45:10,207",...and you can have all the transfer orders that you want.
"00:45:12,460","00:45:14,461",But you have to ask me nicely.
"00:45:16,798","00:45:21,468",-I beg your pardon? -You have to ask me nicely.
"00:45:21,636","00:45:24,971","See, I can deal with the bullets, the bombs and the blood."
"00:45:25,139","00:45:27,974",I don't want money and I don't want medals.
"00:45:28,142","00:45:30,685",What I do want is for you to stand there...
"00:45:30,853","00:45:32,604",...in that faggoty white uniform...
"00:45:32,772","00:45:37,275","...and with your Harvard mouth, extend me some fucking courtesy."
"00:45:40,154","00:45:42,489",You got to ask me nicely.
"00:45:46,202","00:45:48,829","Colonel Jessep, if it's not too much trouble..."
"00:45:48,996","00:45:52,666",...I'd like a copy of the transfer order. Sir.
"00:45:55,795","00:45:57,754",No problem.
"00:46:40,339","00:46:42,048",-Who is it? -It's me.
"00:46:42,216","00:46:44,092",Jo.
"00:46:45,052","00:46:46,344",I've really missed you.
"00:46:46,512","00:46:49,055","I was just saying, it's been three hours--"
"00:46:49,223","00:46:51,808",-Markinson's disappeared. -What?
"00:46:51,976","00:46:55,187",Colonel Markinson's gone U.A. Unauthorized Absence.
"00:46:55,354","00:46:59,483","-I know what it means. When? -This afternoon, after we left."
"00:46:59,650","00:47:02,360",-I'll try to find him in the morning. -I've already tried.
"00:47:02,528","00:47:03,904",You tried?
"00:47:05,239","00:47:10,911",You're coming close to interfering with a government investigation.
"00:47:11,078","00:47:17,417",I'm Louden Downey's attorney. Aunt Ginny feels like she knows me.
"00:47:17,585","00:47:22,005",So I suggested that I get more directly involved with the case.
"00:47:22,173","00:47:25,717",She had Louden sign the papers about an hour ago.
"00:47:25,885","00:47:30,055",I suppose it's too much to hope that you're making this up just to bother me.
"00:47:30,223","00:47:35,227","-Don't worry, you're still lead counsel. -Splendid."
"00:47:35,394","00:47:38,104","I think Kendrick ordered the Code Red, and so do you."
"00:47:40,024","00:47:41,900",Let's go.
"00:47:45,780","00:47:47,656","Officer on deck, ten-hut!"
"00:47:47,823","00:47:49,699",-Did Kendrick order the Code Red? -Sir?
"00:47:49,867","00:47:53,411",Don't say “sir” like I just asked you if you cleaned the latrine.
"00:47:53,579","00:47:57,749",Did Lieutenant Kendrick order you to give Santiago a Code Red?
"00:47:59,085","00:48:01,628","Yes, sir."
"00:48:01,796","00:48:04,506","-Did he? -Yes, sir."
"00:48:08,970","00:48:13,473","-Why didn't you mention this before? -You didn't ask us, sir."
"00:48:13,808","00:48:18,478","Corporal, I get paid no matter how much time you spend in jail."
"00:48:18,646","00:48:20,605","Yes, sir. I know you do, sir."
"00:48:20,773","00:48:22,816","-Fuck you, Harold! -All right."
"00:48:23,985","00:48:28,488",-At ease. Let's sort this thing out. -Shit.
"00:48:28,656","00:48:31,950",There was a platoon meeting on September 6th at 4 p.m.
"00:48:32,118","00:48:36,454",Lieutenant Kendrick says he told you nothing was to happen to Santiago.
"00:48:37,081","00:48:42,294","Now, is this true? I want you to speak freely."
"00:48:45,214","00:48:49,509","Ma'am, that's correct. But then he dismissed the platoon."
"00:48:49,677","00:48:53,597",-And what happened then? -Lt. Kendrick came to our room.
"00:48:53,764","00:48:55,473",When?
"00:48:56,350","00:49:00,478",About five minutes after the meeting broke. About 16:20.
"00:49:00,646","00:49:03,148",And what happened then?
"00:49:03,316","00:49:07,527",Lt. Kendrick ordered us to give Santiago a Code Red.
"00:49:09,196","00:49:13,617",Jack! Jack! They were given an order.
"00:49:16,871","00:49:22,042","-Jack, come on. -I'll be right back. Be right back."
"00:49:22,209","00:49:23,877",How long did you know about the order?
"00:49:24,045","00:49:25,712",I didn't. Who's this?
"00:49:25,880","00:49:29,257","It's Jo Galloway, Downey's lawyer. She's very pleased to meet you."
"00:49:29,425","00:49:32,552",-What are you accusing me of? -How long have you known?
"00:49:32,720","00:49:37,390","He didn't know. If he did and didn't tell us, he'd be violating the code of ethics."
"00:49:37,558","00:49:41,019",He's got enough to worry about. God forbid our clients plead not guilty...
"00:49:41,187","00:49:43,355",...and testify for the record they were ordered.
"00:49:43,522","00:49:46,650",Kendrick told those men not to touch Santiago.
"00:49:46,817","00:49:50,904",Then he told Dawson and Downey to give him a Code Red. Kendrick's lying.
"00:49:51,072","00:49:52,864",-You have proof? -I have the defendants.
"00:49:53,032","00:49:57,410",And I have 23 Marines and a lieutenant with four letters of commendation.
"00:49:57,578","00:49:59,871",-Why did Markinson go U.A.? -We'll never know.
"00:50:00,039","00:50:02,749",-I can't subpoena Markinson? -You won't find him.
"00:50:03,084","00:50:08,296",You know what Markinson did for 17 years? Counterintelligence.
"00:50:08,464","00:50:11,257",Markinson's gone. There is no Markinson.
"00:50:12,927","00:50:17,430","Look, Danny, Jessep's star is on the rise."
"00:50:17,598","00:50:21,393",Division will give me room to spare him and the Corps any embarrassment.
"00:50:21,560","00:50:22,769",How much room?
"00:50:24,063","00:50:27,524",I'll knock it down to involuntary manslaughter. Two years.
"00:50:27,692","00:50:28,942","No, we're going to court."
"00:50:29,110","00:50:30,944","-No, you're not. -Why not?"
"00:50:31,112","00:50:34,030","Because you'll lose, and Danny knows it."
"00:50:34,198","00:50:37,117","And he knows if we go to court, I'll have to go all the way."
"00:50:37,284","00:50:39,536",They'll be charged with the whole truckload.
"00:50:39,704","00:50:42,205","Murder, conspiracy, conduct unbecoming."
"00:50:42,373","00:50:47,127","Danny's got me by the balls here, but not in the courtroom."
"00:50:47,294","00:50:49,087",Danny's an awfully talented lawyer.
"00:50:49,255","00:50:54,134",He won't see his clients go jail for life if they could be home in six months.
"00:50:54,802","00:51:00,056",That's the end of this negotiation. I'll see you at the arraignment.
"00:51:03,477","00:51:06,104","All right, here's the story."
"00:51:06,272","00:51:11,151",The government's offering involuntary manslaughter. Two years.
"00:51:11,318","00:51:13,236",You'll be home in six months.
"00:51:15,990","00:51:22,537",“Wow! You're the greatest lawyer in the world! How can we thank you?”
"00:51:22,747","00:51:28,626","Fellas, you hear what I just said? You'll be home in six months."
"00:51:28,794","00:51:30,879","I'm afraid we can't do that, sir."
"00:51:31,255","00:51:32,297",Do what?
"00:51:32,506","00:51:35,842","-Make a deal, sir. -What are you talking about?"
"00:51:36,010","00:51:38,803",We did nothing wrong. We did our job.
"00:51:38,971","00:51:42,223","If that has consequences, I'll accept them."
"00:51:42,391","00:51:44,476","But I won't say that I'm guilty, sir."
"00:51:46,061","00:51:49,355",-Did she put you up to this? -No.
"00:51:49,523","00:51:51,107","We have a code, sir."
"00:51:51,275","00:51:56,362",You and your code plead not guilty. You'll be in jail for life.
"00:51:56,530","00:52:00,492","Do what I say, and you'll be home in six months."
"00:52:01,327","00:52:05,997","Do it, Harold. Six months, it's nothing. It's a hockey season."
"00:52:08,417","00:52:12,212",-Permission to-- -Speak! Jesus!
"00:52:14,799","00:52:17,217","-What do we do then, sir? -When?"
"00:52:17,384","00:52:20,720","After six months we'll be dishonorably discharged, right, sir?"
"00:52:20,888","00:52:25,391","-Probably. -What do we do then, sir?"
"00:52:28,103","00:52:33,900",We joined the Marines because we wanted to live by a certain code.
"00:52:34,068","00:52:39,405","You're asking us to say we have no honor, that we're not Marines!"
"00:52:39,573","00:52:43,868","If a court decides what we did was wrong, I'll accept my punishment."
"00:52:44,036","00:52:49,749","But I believe I was right. I did my job. I will not dishonor myself, my unit..."
"00:52:49,917","00:52:55,046","...or the Corps, so that I can go home in six months!"
"00:52:55,214","00:52:57,048",Sir!
"00:53:03,848","00:53:06,391",I'd like to talk to Lance Corporal Dawson...
"00:53:06,559","00:53:08,434","...alone for a minute, please."
"00:53:10,104","00:53:11,437",Sergeant!
"00:53:14,775","00:53:19,153",-We'd like to go to another room. -Sit down.
"00:53:30,875","00:53:32,876","You don't like me very much, do you?"
"00:53:34,378","00:53:38,590","Forget it, don't answer that. It doesn't matter."
"00:53:43,804","00:53:48,892","You know, Downey worships you."
"00:53:51,145","00:53:53,563",He's gonna do whatever you do.
"00:53:54,648","00:53:59,485","Are you really gonna let this happen to him because of a code, Harold?"
"00:53:59,653","00:54:01,821",-Do you think we were right? -Doesn't matter--
"00:54:01,989","00:54:03,406",Do you think we were right?!
"00:54:04,241","00:54:05,992",I think you'd lose.
"00:54:08,120","00:54:09,704",You're such a coward.
"00:54:09,872","00:54:12,498",I can't believe they let you wear a uniform.
"00:54:15,002","00:54:17,754",I'm not gonna feel responsible for this. I did all I could.
"00:54:17,922","00:54:21,341",You're going to Leavenworth for the better part of your life...
"00:54:21,508","00:54:24,135",...and I don't give a shit.
"00:54:24,303","00:54:28,181",What happened to saluting an officer when he leaves the room?
"00:54:36,231","00:54:37,357",Open it up.
"00:54:40,694","00:54:45,198",I don't believe it! He's gonna go to jail to spite me!
"00:54:45,366","00:54:47,533","If he wants to jump off a cliff, that's his business."
"00:54:47,701","00:54:49,369",I'm not gonna hold his hand.
"00:54:49,536","00:54:53,915",-How do I get him a new lawyer? -Make a motion at the arraignment.
"00:54:54,083","00:54:58,378",Just tell the judge you want new counsel assigned.
"00:55:00,047","00:55:01,381",That's that.
"00:55:02,091","00:55:04,717","One thing, though. When you ask the judge..."
"00:55:04,885","00:55:06,719",...be sure and ask nicely.
"00:55:07,596","00:55:13,559",-What do you want from me? -I want you to make an argument.
"00:55:13,727","00:55:18,523","That didn't help Calley at My Lai, or the Nazis at Nuremburg."
"00:55:18,691","00:55:21,901","For chrissakes, Sam. Do you think that's the same..."
"00:55:22,069","00:55:25,446",...as two teenagers executing an order they didn't think would harm?
"00:55:25,614","00:55:27,490",These guys aren't Nazis.
"00:55:27,658","00:55:30,576","Don't look now, but you're making an argument."
"00:55:32,246","00:55:35,873","Yeah, yeah. Tomorrow morning, I get them a new attorney."
"00:55:36,041","00:55:40,336",Why are you so afraid to be a lawyer? You Daddy's expectations that high?
"00:55:40,504","00:55:43,756","Please, spare me the psychobabble father bullshit!"
"00:55:43,924","00:55:47,427","They'll have their day in court, but with another lawyer."
"00:55:47,594","00:55:52,056",Another lawyer won't be good enough. They need you. You know how to win.
"00:55:52,224","00:55:56,602","You know they have a case. You walk away from this, you seal their fate."
"00:55:56,770","00:56:00,064",Their fate was sealed the moment Santiago died.
"00:56:00,232","00:56:01,899",Do you believe they have a case?
"00:56:02,067","00:56:04,944","You and Dawson, you both live in the same dream world."
"00:56:05,112","00:56:09,157","It doesn't matter what I believe, it only matters what I can prove."
"00:56:09,324","00:56:13,953",So don't tell me what I know and don't know. I know the law!
"00:56:19,126","00:56:23,171",You know nothing about the law. You're a used-car salesman.
"00:56:23,338","00:56:29,552",An ambulance-chaser with a rank. You're nothing. Live with that.
"00:56:35,684","00:56:37,310",So I told Duncan:
"00:56:37,478","00:56:41,481","“If you wanna take this to court, you'll force me to file discovery motions..."
"00:56:41,648","00:56:45,151",...and you're gonna spend a year going blind on paperwork...
"00:56:45,319","00:56:48,488",...because a 90-year-old man misread the Delaware insurance code.”
"00:56:48,655","00:56:53,951","-So, what happened? -Fifteen minutes later, he makes a deal."
"00:57:40,124","00:57:42,333",All rise.
"00:57:49,091","00:57:55,346",-Where are we? -Docket number 411275 VR-5.
"00:57:55,514","00:57:58,099",The United States v. Lance Corporal Harold Dawson...
"00:57:58,267","00:58:00,476",...and Private First Class Louden Downey.
"00:58:00,644","00:58:03,896","The accused are charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder..."
"00:58:04,064","00:58:06,315",...and conduct unbecoming a United States Marine.
"00:58:06,483","00:58:08,526",Does the defense wish to enter a plea?
"00:58:10,279","00:58:11,737",Yeah.
"00:58:15,492","00:58:16,826",They're not guilty.
"00:58:20,080","00:58:22,665",Enter a plea of “not guilty” for the accused.
"00:58:22,833","00:58:29,589","We will adjourn until 10:00, three weeks from today, when we will reconvene."
"00:58:45,772","00:58:49,066",Why does a lieutenant with nine months' experience...
"00:58:49,234","00:58:53,487",...and a record for plea-bargaining get assigned a murder case?
"00:58:55,532","00:58:59,785",Would it be so that it never sees the inside of a courtroom?
"00:59:01,038","00:59:07,543","We'll work out of my apartment. Jo, bring legal pads and pens."
"00:59:07,711","00:59:11,088","Sam, get a couple desk lamps. I need you to start a medical profile."
"00:59:11,256","00:59:15,134","Jo, get Dawson's, Downey's and Santiago's conduct reports."
"00:59:15,302","00:59:19,597","I've only got Yoo-hoo and Cocoa Puffs, so if you want anything else, bring it."
"00:59:19,765","00:59:21,891",-Okay? -Yeah.
"00:59:28,065","00:59:31,234",So this is what a courtroom looks like.
"00:59:40,869","00:59:45,164",-You speak to your friend at the NIS? -Yeah.
"00:59:45,332","00:59:49,669","She said if Markinson doesn't want to be found, we won't find him."
"00:59:49,836","00:59:54,382","She said I could be Markinson, and you wouldn't know it."
"00:59:54,549","00:59:58,594",-Are you Markinson? -No.
"00:59:58,804","01:00:03,849",I'm not Markinson. That's two down.
"01:00:05,769","01:00:07,770",What?
"01:00:08,438","01:00:11,941","I'm just wondering, now that Joanne's on this..."
"01:00:12,442","01:00:14,819",I'm just wondering if you still need me.
"01:00:14,987","01:00:17,530","-They were following orders, Sam. -An illegal order."
"01:00:17,698","01:00:19,991",You think Dawson and Downey knew it was illegal?
"01:00:20,242","01:00:22,827",It doesn't matter. Any decent human would have--
"01:00:22,995","01:00:25,705",They're not permitted to question orders.
"01:00:25,872","01:00:30,501","Then what's the secret? I give orders every day, nobody obeys!"
"01:00:30,669","01:00:32,378",We have softball and marching bands.
"01:00:32,546","01:00:36,799",They work at a place where you have to wear camouflage or you might get shot.
"01:00:44,516","01:00:48,769",I need you. You're better at research than I am.
"01:00:48,937","01:00:51,564",And you know how to prepare a witness.
"01:00:56,987","01:01:01,741",I've got medical reports and Chinese food. I say we eat first.
"01:01:07,706","01:01:09,707",What?
"01:01:10,876","01:01:13,711",Did you get any kung pao chicken?
"01:01:16,340","01:01:19,425",This is our defense. Intent. No one can prove there was poison.
"01:01:19,593","01:01:22,720",Code Red. They're common and accepted in Guantánamo Bay.
"01:01:22,888","01:01:28,351","The order. A, Kendrick gave it, B, they had no choice but to follow."
"01:01:28,518","01:01:30,895",-What about motive? -We're weak. They had one.
"01:01:31,063","01:01:33,105",That doesn't make them guilty.
"01:01:33,273","01:01:36,776","Relax. We'll deal with that later. For now, we start with intent."
"01:01:36,943","01:01:41,906",We must show that Santiago could've died from something other than poison.
"01:01:42,074","01:01:46,452","Jo, find out all about lactic acidosis."
"01:01:46,620","01:01:49,163",This is Lt. Commander Galloway with the JAG Corps.
"01:01:49,331","01:01:53,125",I've been trying to track down a Lt. Colonel Matthew Markinson....
"01:01:53,293","01:01:55,419","Doctor, was there any sign of external damage?"
"01:01:55,587","01:01:58,422",No scrapes? No cuts?
"01:01:58,632","01:02:02,635",Bruises? Broken bones? Was there any sign of violence?
"01:02:02,803","01:02:07,473",-Other than the dead body? -Shit. I walk into that every time.
"01:02:07,641","01:02:12,186",He ordered me and Dawson to give Willy a Code Red.
"01:02:12,354","01:02:13,979",Answers still have to come faster.
"01:02:14,147","01:02:16,148",This farm boy thing will play for a while...
"01:02:16,316","01:02:18,901","...but in the end, it sounds like he's searching for it."
"01:02:19,069","01:02:25,491",Right. And Willy is Private Santiago. Willy is someone with a mother.
"01:02:26,493","01:02:30,121","They drew court members. Seven men, two women."
"01:02:30,288","01:02:32,248",All experienced officers.
"01:02:32,416","01:02:35,334",The women have no children. That's a bad break.
"01:02:35,502","01:02:39,547",My father said a jury trial is about assigning blame.
"01:02:39,714","01:02:44,218",Santiago's dead and he shouldn't be. They want to know who's to blame.
"01:02:44,386","01:02:46,804","Ross hands them our clients, we hand them Kendrick."
"01:02:46,972","01:02:52,560","This won't be won by the law, but by the lawyers. So, poker faces."
"01:02:52,727","01:02:57,940","Don't flinch. If something goes wrong, don't hang your head or scribble."
"01:02:58,108","01:03:01,777","Whatever happens, you have to look like you expected it."
"01:03:01,945","01:03:06,740","-You pass me documents-- -”Swiftly, and don't look overanxious.”"
"01:03:06,908","01:03:09,618","Don't wear that perfume in court, wrecks my concentration."
"01:03:09,786","01:03:13,414",-Really? -I was talking to Sam.
"01:03:15,041","01:03:19,628",-What time is it? -It's time to go home. Try to sleep.
"01:03:19,796","01:03:22,214",-Give me a ride? -Sure.
"01:03:25,427","01:03:31,223","-You're a good man, Charlie Brown. -I'll see you in court, counselor."
"01:03:36,438","01:03:39,899","-Danny, I-- -I know. We've had our differences."
"01:03:40,066","01:03:44,778",We both said things we didn't mean. But you're happy I stuck with the case.
"01:03:44,946","01:03:51,076","If you've gained some respect for me, well, of course I'm happy about that."
"01:03:51,244","01:03:55,581","But it's no big deal. You like me, I won't make you say it."
"01:03:56,374","01:03:59,084",I was just gonna tell you to wear matching socks tomorrow.
"01:04:01,213","01:04:04,340",Okay. Good tip.
"01:04:05,133","01:04:10,554",-We're ready. -You'd better believe it.
"01:04:19,022","01:04:22,024",We're gonna get creamed.
"01:04:50,095","01:04:52,012",Lieutenant Kaffee.
"01:04:52,847","01:04:55,891","You are gonna save our son, aren't you?"
"01:04:56,059","01:04:58,060",I'll do my best.
"01:04:58,228","01:05:02,690","Danny, I'd like you to meet Ginny Miller, Louden's aunt."
"01:05:03,525","01:05:05,776",You're Aunt Ginny?
"01:05:07,821","01:05:12,783",-I was expecting someone older. -So was I.
"01:05:17,497","01:05:20,165",-Last chance. I'll flip you for it. -All rise.
"01:05:20,333","01:05:21,333",Too late.
"01:05:30,010","01:05:35,764","All those having business with this court-martial, stand forward."
"01:05:35,932","01:05:39,268",Colonel Julius Alexander Randolph is presiding.
"01:05:39,436","01:05:43,522",Is the government prepared to make an opening statement?
"01:05:46,610","01:05:48,485",The facts of the case are these:
"01:05:48,653","01:05:54,700","On September 6th, the accused entered PFC Santiago's room."
"01:05:54,868","01:05:57,703","They woke him up, tied his arms and legs..."
"01:05:57,871","01:06:00,205",...and forced a rag into his throat.
"01:06:00,373","01:06:06,045","Minutes later, a reaction called lactic acidosis caused his lungs to bleed."
"01:06:06,212","01:06:11,717","He drowned in his own blood, and was dead at 37 minutes past midnight."
"01:06:11,885","01:06:16,889","These are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed."
"01:06:17,057","01:06:22,353",That's right. What I've just told you is exactly what you will hear...
"01:06:22,520","01:06:27,107",...from Lance Corporal Dawson and Private Downey.
"01:06:27,275","01:06:32,321","Furthermore, we will also show that the accused soaked the rag in poison..."
"01:06:32,489","01:06:37,826",...and entered Santiago's room with motive and intent to kill.
"01:06:37,994","01:06:43,374",Lieutenant Kaffee is gonna try and pull off a little magic act here.
"01:06:43,541","01:06:45,584",He'll try a little misdirection.
"01:06:46,044","01:06:49,296",He'll astonish you with stories of rituals.
"01:06:49,464","01:06:55,678",Dazzle you with official-sounding terms like “Code Red.”
"01:06:55,845","01:06:58,806",He might even try to cut into a few officers for you.
"01:06:58,973","01:07:03,727","He'll have no evidence, none, but it'll be entertaining."
"01:07:03,978","01:07:05,396",But in the end...
"01:07:05,563","01:07:10,150",...all the magic in the world will not divert your attention from the fact...
"01:07:10,318","01:07:17,241","...that Willy Santiago is dead, and Dawson and Downey killed him."
"01:07:17,409","01:07:21,245","These are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed."
"01:07:22,372","01:07:24,081",Lieutenant Kaffee.
"01:07:24,249","01:07:27,251",There was no poison on the rag and there was no intent to kill...
"01:07:27,419","01:07:31,463","...and any attempt to prove otherwise is futile, because it just ain't true."
"01:07:32,048","01:07:35,300",Dawson and Downey didn't go into Santiago's room...
"01:07:35,468","01:07:37,678",...because of vengeance.
"01:07:37,887","01:07:41,849",It wasn't to kill or harm. And they weren't looking for kicks.
"01:07:42,016","01:07:45,310",It's because it was what they were ordered to do.
"01:07:45,895","01:07:50,482",Let me say that again. It's because they were ordered to do it.
"01:07:51,109","01:07:52,985","Out in the real world, that means nothing."
"01:07:53,153","01:07:55,487",And here in the Washington Navy Yard...
"01:07:55,655","01:07:57,281",...doesn't mean a whole lot more.
"01:07:57,449","01:07:58,991",But if you're a Marine...
"01:07:59,159","01:08:03,454","...assigned to Rifle Security Company Windward, Guantánamo Bay, Cuba..."
"01:08:03,621","01:08:06,999","...you follow orders, or you pack your bags."
"01:08:07,208","01:08:12,421",Make no mistake about it. Dawson and Downey are sitting here...
"01:08:12,589","01:08:15,841",...because they did their job.
"01:08:19,429","01:08:22,514",Is the government ready to call its first witness?
"01:08:22,682","01:08:26,351","Please the court, government calls Mr. R.C. Mc.Guire."
"01:08:30,857","01:08:33,025","Raise your right hand, please."
"01:08:33,193","01:08:38,864","Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?"
"01:08:39,032","01:08:41,408","-I do. -Have a seat, please."
"01:08:42,494","01:08:45,704",Would you state your full name and occupation?
"01:08:45,872","01:08:50,209","Robert C. Mc.Guire, special agent, Naval Investigative Service."
"01:08:50,376","01:08:56,715",Did you receive a letter from PFC Santiago on 3 September of this year?
"01:08:56,883","01:08:58,967",-We did. -What did it say?
"01:08:59,135","01:09:03,847",That a member of Santiago's unit had illegally fired across the fenceline.
"01:09:04,015","01:09:06,058",Was that Marine identified in the letter?
"01:09:06,226","01:09:11,730",No. I told Colonel Jessep that I would be coming down to investigate.
"01:09:11,898","01:09:13,565",And what did you find?
"01:09:13,733","01:09:16,819",The shift reported only one sentry returned his weapon...
"01:09:16,986","01:09:18,529",...with ammo missing.
"01:09:18,696","01:09:21,990",-Who was that? -Lance Corporal Harold Dawson.
"01:09:22,158","01:09:23,742",Your Witness.
"01:09:26,329","01:09:29,665","Mr. McGuire, have you questioned Dawson about the shooting?"
"01:09:29,916","01:09:33,544","Yes, he claims to have been engaged in some manner by the enemy."
"01:09:33,711","01:09:35,963",-But you don't believe him? -It's not my place--
"01:09:36,130","01:09:41,009",Why wasn't Dawson charged with firing at the enemy without cause?
"01:09:42,804","01:09:45,681",There wasn't enough evidence to support such a charge.
"01:09:45,849","01:09:47,474",Thank you.
"01:09:48,893","01:09:55,941",Why was there not enough evidence? You had William Santiago's letter.
"01:09:57,110","01:10:02,614",Santiago was the only eyewitness. I had no chance to interview him.
"01:10:02,782","01:10:05,784","And now we'll never know, will we, Mr. McGuire?"
"01:10:06,536","01:10:07,995",No.
"01:10:09,414","01:10:13,584",-No more questions. -The witness is excused.
"01:10:16,504","01:10:18,964","Corporal Carl Hammaker, Marine barracks..."
"01:10:19,132","01:10:22,467","...Rifle Security Company Windward, 2nd Platoon Bravo."
"01:10:22,635","01:10:24,970",Were you present at a meeting...
"01:10:25,138","01:10:29,433",...held by Lieutenant Kendrick on September 6th?
"01:10:29,601","01:10:33,478","-Yes, sir. -What was the substance of it?"
"01:10:33,646","01:10:36,690",Lieutenant Kendrick told us we had an informer in our group.
"01:10:36,858","01:10:42,487",That Santiago had reported to the NIS on a member of our platoon.
"01:10:42,655","01:10:44,865",Did that make you mad?
"01:10:45,033","01:10:48,327","-You can tell the truth. Did it? -Yes, sir."
"01:10:48,494","01:10:49,661",How mad?
"01:10:49,829","01:10:53,582",Santiago betrayed a code we believe in.
"01:10:53,750","01:10:56,376",-Were other men also angry? -Object. Speculation.
"01:10:56,628","01:10:58,211",Were Dawson and Downey?
"01:10:58,463","01:11:00,714",Is the counsel asking this witness to testify...
"01:11:00,882","01:11:03,508",...as to how my clients felt on Sept. 6th?
"01:11:03,927","01:11:05,510",Sustained.
"01:11:07,388","01:11:11,350",Did Lieutenant Kendrick leave a standing order at that meeting?
"01:11:11,517","01:11:13,769","-Yes, sir. -What was it?"
"01:11:15,897","01:11:19,316",It was clear he didn't want us taking matters into our own hands.
"01:11:19,484","01:11:26,198",-What was the order? -Santiago wasn't to be touched.
"01:11:27,617","01:11:30,452",Your witness.
"01:11:30,620","01:11:34,373",Were you in Dawson and Downey's room five minutes later?
"01:11:34,540","01:11:35,874","No, sir."
"01:11:36,250","01:11:40,879",-Thanks. No more questions. -The witness is excused.
"01:11:44,842","01:11:47,260",Government calls Corporal Raymond Thomas.
"01:11:47,428","01:11:52,933",Captain Ross is planning to call all the members of the platoon to testify.
"01:11:53,101","01:11:55,477",In light of the defense Kaffee is planning...
"01:11:55,645","01:11:59,314",...the platoon leader's instructions seems relevant testimony.
"01:11:59,482","01:12:04,069",The defense concedes that all 22 will confirm Hammaker's account...
"01:12:04,237","01:12:06,488",...if the government concedes none of them...
"01:12:06,656","01:12:10,409",...were in Dawson and Downey's room at 1620.
"01:12:10,576","01:12:14,913",-Captain? -The government will stipulate.
"01:12:15,081","01:12:19,001",Then we will adjourn. You can call your next witness tomorrow.
"01:12:19,168","01:12:20,919",All rise.
"01:12:32,598","01:12:35,308",-Let's go over the doctor again. -It's the right approach.
"01:12:35,560","01:12:37,352",We've been over this already.
"01:12:37,520","01:12:41,231","At 3:00, Stone says he doesn't know what killed Santiago."
"01:12:41,399","01:12:46,111","Then he meets with Jessep, and at 5:00 he says it was poison? He's lying."
"01:12:46,279","01:12:47,362",That's a relief.
"01:12:47,530","01:12:50,991","I was afraid I couldn't use the “liar, liar, pants on fire” defense."
"01:12:51,159","01:12:57,414",We can't prove coercion. Let's go over what we have.
"01:13:06,049","01:13:09,634",Private Santiago was admitted to the ER at 00:12...
"01:13:09,802","01:13:13,680",...and he was pronounced dead at 00:37.
"01:13:13,848","01:13:17,142","Dr. Stone, what is lactic acidosis?"
"01:13:17,310","01:13:20,896",If the muscles and other cells burn sugar instead of oxygen...
"01:13:21,064","01:13:22,564",...lactic acid is produced.
"01:13:22,732","01:13:26,151",That lactic acid is what caused Santiago's lungs to bleed.
"01:13:26,319","01:13:31,656",How long does it take before the muscles start burning sugar?
"01:13:32,533","01:13:38,121",-Twenty to 30 minutes. -What made it faster with Santiago?
"01:13:38,289","01:13:43,502",-An ingested poison of some kind. -Object. The witness is speculating.
"01:13:43,669","01:13:45,378",He is an expert medical witness.
"01:13:45,546","01:13:48,173","In this court, his opinion is not speculation."
"01:13:48,341","01:13:53,845",He is not a criminologist. The medical facts are inconclusive.
"01:13:54,013","01:13:57,682",A point I'm confident you'll illustrate on your cross-examination.
"01:13:57,850","01:14:00,852",So I'm sure you won't mind if his opinion is admitted now?
"01:14:01,437","01:14:03,522","Not at all, sir."
"01:14:05,066","01:14:11,154",-Did Willy Santiago die of poisoning? -Absolutely.
"01:14:11,322","01:14:15,325",You're aware that the lab and coroner's reports show no traces of poison?
"01:14:15,493","01:14:17,953","-Yes, I am. -Then how do you justify--?"
"01:14:18,121","01:14:23,583",There are literally dozens of toxins which are virtually undetectable.
"01:14:23,751","01:14:27,462",The nature of the acidosis is the compelling factor here.
"01:14:28,047","01:14:30,173","Thank you, sir."
"01:14:32,260","01:14:36,888","Commander, is it possible for a person to have an affliction, some condition..."
"01:14:37,056","01:14:39,891",...which might also speed up acidosis?
"01:14:42,728","01:14:46,481",-Is it possible? -It's possible.
"01:14:46,649","01:14:50,110",What might some of those conditions be?
"01:14:50,278","01:14:53,405",If a person had a coronary or cerebral disorder...
"01:14:53,573","01:14:55,657",...the process would be more rapid.
"01:14:55,825","01:14:57,909",If I had a coronary condition...
"01:14:58,077","01:15:01,663",...and a perfectly clean rag was placed in my mouth and pushed too far...
"01:15:01,831","01:15:04,749",...is it possible my cells would continue burning sugar...
"01:15:04,917","01:15:06,418",...after the rag was taken out?
"01:15:06,919","01:15:09,379",It would have to be a very serious condition.
"01:15:09,547","01:15:11,673",Is it possible to have a serious condition...
"01:15:11,841","01:15:13,800",...where initial symptoms were so mild...
"01:15:13,968","01:15:18,221",...as to escape a physician during a routine medical exam?
"01:15:18,389","01:15:21,099",Possibly. There would still be symptoms.
"01:15:21,267","01:15:22,601",What kind of symptoms?
"01:15:23,019","01:15:25,228",-There are hundreds of-- -Chest pains?
"01:15:25,396","01:15:28,607",-Yes. Yes. -Shortness of breath? Fatigue?
"01:15:29,066","01:15:30,442",Of course.
"01:15:36,240","01:15:40,744","-Doctor, is this your signature? -Yes, it is."
"01:15:41,287","01:15:45,123",This is an order for Private Santiago to be put on restricted duty.
"01:15:45,291","01:15:49,127",Would you read your handwritten remarks at the bottom of the page?
"01:15:49,295","01:15:55,634","“Patient complains of chest pains, shortness of breath, and fatigue."
"01:15:55,801","01:16:00,138",Restricted from running distances over five miles for one week.”
"01:16:02,308","01:16:05,644",Isn't it possible Santiago had a serious coronary condition...
"01:16:05,811","01:16:08,313","...and it was that condition, not poison..."
"01:16:08,481","01:16:10,815",...that caused the rapid chemical reaction?
"01:16:10,983","01:16:14,152",-No. -It's not possible?
"01:16:14,654","01:16:19,157",No. I personally give each man a thorough physical examination.
"01:16:19,325","01:16:22,327",Private Santiago was given a clean bill of health.
"01:16:22,495","01:16:24,829","That's why it had to be poison, right?"
"01:16:24,997","01:16:27,791",Because if you gave a man with a serious condition...
"01:16:27,959","01:16:31,670",...a clean bill of health and he died from a heart-related incident...
"01:16:31,837","01:16:33,755",...you'd have a lot to answer for.
"01:16:33,923","01:16:36,800",-Object! Move to strike! -Sustained.
"01:16:38,052","01:16:41,179","I have no more questions, Your Honor."
"01:16:41,347","01:16:44,683",You've held a license to practice medicine for 17 years.
"01:16:44,850","01:16:48,478","You're certified in internal medicine, you're chief of internal medicine..."
"01:16:48,646","01:16:52,691",...at a hospital which has served 5426 people.
"01:16:52,858","01:16:57,654","In your professional opinion, was Willy Santiago poisoned?"
"01:16:57,822","01:17:02,575",We ask that the doctor's testimony be stricken from the record.
"01:17:02,743","01:17:08,373",-The court should disregard it. -The objection's overruled.
"01:17:08,541","01:17:13,420","We strenuously object, and requests an 802 conference..."
"01:17:13,587","01:17:16,798",...so His Honor can hear discussion before ruling on this objection.
"01:17:16,966","01:17:21,636",-The objection has been overruled. -Move to reconsider.
"01:17:21,804","01:17:27,058","Noted. The witness is an expert, and the court will hear his opinion!"
"01:17:31,480","01:17:39,029","In your expert professional opinion, was Willy Santiago poisoned?"
"01:17:39,989","01:17:44,868","-Yes. -Thank you, sir. No more questions."
"01:17:45,119","01:17:47,370",You may step down.
"01:17:51,083","01:17:57,380","While we reserve the right to call rebuttal witnesses, government rests."
"01:17:57,548","01:18:00,050",We'll recess until Monday the 19th...
"01:18:00,217","01:18:04,596",...when the defense will call its first witness.
"01:18:05,139","01:18:07,265",All rise.
"01:18:15,816","01:18:21,071",“I strenuously object”? Is that how it works?
"01:18:21,238","01:18:25,283","“Objection.” “Overruled!” “No, I strenuously object!”"
"01:18:25,451","01:18:29,454","-”Oh, then I'll reconsider!” -I got it on the record."
"01:18:29,622","01:18:32,082",You got the court thinking we're afraid of the doctor.
"01:18:32,249","01:18:34,793","You object once, so we can say he's not a criminologist."
"01:18:35,002","01:18:38,296","You keep after it, our cross looks like a bunch of fancy lawyer tricks."
"01:18:38,547","01:18:41,716",It's the difference between paper law and trial law!
"01:18:41,967","01:18:45,387","-The judge called him an expert! -Sam, she made a mistake."
"01:18:45,554","01:18:47,222",Let's not relive it.
"01:18:48,974","01:18:53,436",I'm gonna go call my wife. I'll see you tonight.
"01:18:54,814","01:18:59,401",-Why do you hate them so much? -They beat up on a weakling.
"01:18:59,568","01:19:02,654",The rest is this just smoke-filled-coffeehouse crap.
"01:19:02,822","01:19:05,907",They tortured and tormented a weaker kid!
"01:19:06,075","01:19:08,743","They didn't like him, so they killed him. Why?"
"01:19:08,911","01:19:10,954",Because he couldn't run very fast!
"01:19:11,122","01:19:16,668",-Everybody take the night off. -I'm sorry...
"01:19:16,836","01:19:23,007",We've been working 20 hours a day. Go see your wife and daughter.
"01:19:23,175","01:19:30,181","Jo, go do.... Whatever it is you do when you're not here."
"01:19:30,433","01:19:32,767",-What day is tomorrow? -Saturday.
"01:19:32,935","01:19:34,936",We'll start at 10.
"01:19:38,941","01:19:42,026",Why do you like them so much?
"01:19:45,489","01:19:49,617","Because they stand on a wall and say, “Nothing's gonna hurt you tonight."
"01:19:49,785","01:19:51,661",Not on my watch.”
"01:19:56,750","01:20:01,171",Don't worry about the doctor. This trial starts Monday.
"01:20:28,782","01:20:32,076",I'm sorry to bother you. I should have called first.
"01:20:32,244","01:20:37,624","No, I was just watching the ball game. Come on in."
"01:20:51,347","01:20:56,893",I was wondering how you'd feel if I took you to dinner tonight?
"01:20:57,061","01:20:59,938",-Are you asking me out on a date? -No.
"01:21:00,105","01:21:02,065",-It sounded like you were. -I wasn't.
"01:21:02,233","01:21:05,109","I've been asked out before, and that's what it sounded like."
"01:21:06,237","01:21:09,280",Do you like seafood? I know a good seafood place.
"01:21:09,448","01:21:10,949",Okay.
"01:21:17,456","01:21:20,625",My third case was a “drunk and disorderly”. It lasted nine weeks.
"01:21:20,793","01:21:23,461",I rounded up 31 people from the bar that night.
"01:21:23,629","01:21:26,965",Nine weeks on a D and D? What was the prosecutor offering?
"01:21:27,132","01:21:29,592",Fifteen days.
"01:21:31,428","01:21:33,429",You sure hustled the shit out of him.
"01:21:33,597","01:21:35,723","After that, I got shifted to Internal Affairs."
"01:21:35,891","01:21:36,891",Tough to blame them.
"01:21:37,059","01:21:41,729",Where I have earned two medals and two letters of commendation.
"01:21:42,147","01:21:44,816",Why are you always giving me your résumé?
"01:21:48,821","01:21:52,740",-I want you to think I'm a good lawyer. -I do.
"01:21:52,992","01:21:54,993","No, you don't."
"01:21:58,539","01:22:06,129",I think you're an exceptional lawyer. The court members respond to you.
"01:22:06,297","01:22:11,509",I see you convince them. Dawson and Downey will owe you their lives.
"01:22:15,222","01:22:17,890","Jo, I think...."
"01:22:18,809","01:22:22,478",I think you should prepare yourself for the fact we're gonna lose.
"01:22:22,688","01:22:26,024",Ross's opening statement was all true.
"01:22:26,191","01:22:28,693",Let's pretend it would matter to the court...
"01:22:28,861","01:22:30,945",...that the guys were given an order.
"01:22:31,113","01:22:33,615",I can't prove it ever happened.
"01:22:33,782","01:22:36,284",We'll keep doing what we're doing and put on a show...
"01:22:36,452","01:22:41,664",...but all we have is the testimony of two people accused of murder.
"01:22:42,916","01:22:49,464","-We'll find Markinson. -Jo, we're gonna lose, and lose huge."
"01:22:52,801","01:22:57,889","Corporal Barnes, Windward Barracks, Guantánamo Bay, Cuba."
"01:22:58,057","01:23:02,352",Name some reasons why a Marine would receive a Code Red.
"01:23:02,519","01:23:05,688",Being late for platoon or company meetings...
"01:23:05,856","01:23:09,817","...keeping barracks in disorder, falling back on a run...."
"01:23:09,985","01:23:12,362","-Have you ever received a Code Red? -Yes, sir."
"01:23:12,529","01:23:15,990",I dropped my weapon in a drill.
"01:23:16,158","01:23:23,081",It was over 100 degrees. My palms were sweaty and I hadn't used resin.
"01:23:23,248","01:23:28,002",-What happened? -The guys threw a blanket over me.
"01:23:28,170","01:23:33,466",They punched me on the arms and poured glue on my hands.
"01:23:33,634","01:23:38,596",And it worked. I ain't never dropped my weapon since.
"01:23:38,847","01:23:42,517","-Was Private Santiago ever late? -Yes, sir."
"01:23:42,685","01:23:45,395","-Was his barracks ever in disorder? -Yes, sir."
"01:23:45,562","01:23:47,980",-Did he ever fall back on a run? -All the time.
"01:23:48,148","01:23:53,277","Did he ever, prior to September 6th, receive a Code Red?"
"01:23:53,445","01:23:54,737","No, sir."
"01:23:54,947","01:23:56,864","-Never? -No, sir."
"01:23:58,492","01:24:00,952",You got a Code Red because your palms were sweaty.
"01:24:01,120","01:24:04,789","Why didn't Santiago, this burden to his unit, ever get one?"
"01:24:06,625","01:24:11,713","-Dawson wouldn't allow it, sir. -Dawson wouldn't allow it."
"01:24:11,880","01:24:17,468","The guys talked tough about Santiago, but they were too afraid of Dawson."
"01:24:17,636","01:24:19,971",Object. Witness is speculating.
"01:24:20,139","01:24:23,307",Did you want to give Santiago a Code Red?
"01:24:23,475","01:24:24,559","Yes, sir."
"01:24:24,727","01:24:28,646",-Why didn't you? -Because Dawson would kick my butt.
"01:24:28,814","01:24:34,110",Good enough. Captain Ross is gonna will ask you some questions.
"01:24:34,278","01:24:36,863",Corporal Barnes...
"01:24:37,030","01:24:41,325",...I hold here the Marine Recruit Outline. Are you familiar with it?
"01:24:41,493","01:24:43,494","-Have you read it? Good. -Yes, sir."
"01:24:43,662","01:24:47,832","Turn to the chapter that deals with Code Reds, please."
"01:24:48,625","01:24:53,004",-Sir? -Just flip to the page with Code Reds.
"01:24:55,090","01:25:00,511","Well, “Code Red” is a term that we use down at Gitmo. I don't know if it's--"
"01:25:00,679","01:25:02,930","Oh, we're in luck, then."
"01:25:06,101","01:25:08,770","“Standard Operating Procedure, Rifle Security Company..."
"01:25:08,937","01:25:10,605","...Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.”"
"01:25:10,773","01:25:14,484",I assume we'll find “Code Red” in there?
"01:25:14,651","01:25:16,444","-No, sir. -No?"
"01:25:16,612","01:25:22,617","I'm a Marine. Is there no book, no set of orders or regulations..."
"01:25:22,785","01:25:27,121",...telling me that one of my duties is to perform Code Reds?
"01:25:27,956","01:25:30,625","No, sir. No book, sir."
"01:25:30,793","01:25:33,461",No further questions.
"01:25:34,880","01:25:39,717","Would you turn to the page that says where the mess hall is, please?"
"01:25:39,885","01:25:42,887","Lieutenant Kaffee, that's not in the book, sir."
"01:25:44,556","01:25:50,603","-You mean you've never had a meal? -No, sir. Three squares a day, sir."
"01:25:51,396","01:25:56,150",I don't understand. How did you find the mess hall if it's not in this book?
"01:25:58,779","01:26:05,076",-I guess I just followed the crowd. -No more questions.
"01:26:05,244","01:26:08,830","-Corporal Barnes, you may step down. -Thank you, sir."
"01:26:14,503","01:26:17,129","Seven tonight, we'll do a final Kendrick review."
"01:26:17,297","01:26:19,882",I wanna slam-dunk this guy.
"01:26:31,436","01:26:35,731","-Hey, Luther. -Admiral! How's the big case going?"
"01:26:35,899","01:26:38,484",-Nose to the grindstone. -No flies on you.
"01:26:38,735","01:26:40,570",Rolling stone gathers no moss.
"01:26:40,821","01:26:43,489","Well, it ain't over till the fat lady sings."
"01:26:43,657","01:26:45,616",You can say that again.
"01:26:46,201","01:26:49,954",-It ain't over till the fat lady sings. -Till the fat lady sings.
"01:26:50,122","01:26:52,290",I walked into that one.
"01:27:03,886","01:27:09,307",-Jesus Christ! -You left the door unlocked.
"01:27:09,474","01:27:12,268",-You scared the shit out of me. -Just keep driving.
"01:27:12,519","01:27:14,312",Are you aware you're under subpoena?
"01:27:14,479","01:27:18,190",Yes. I'm also aware the lives of two Marines are in your hands.
"01:27:18,358","01:27:20,484","If I could do something about that, I would."
"01:27:20,652","01:27:22,778","Since I can't, all I can do is help you."
"01:27:22,946","01:27:25,239",-What do you know? -I know everything.
"01:27:25,449","01:27:27,742",-Was it a Code Red? -Yes.
"01:27:27,993","01:27:29,994",-Did Kendrick give the order? -Yes.
"01:27:30,162","01:27:32,079",Did you witness it? Did you witness it?
"01:27:32,247","01:27:33,664",-No. -Then how do you know?
"01:27:33,832","01:27:35,499","-I know. -Yeah, you know shit."
"01:27:35,667","01:27:37,960",He was never gonna be transferred off that base.
"01:27:43,926","01:27:47,178","Jessep was gonna keep him on the base, said he wanted him “trained.”"
"01:27:47,346","01:27:49,847","-You signed the transfer order. -Yeah, I know."
"01:27:50,015","01:27:55,394","I signed them when you got to Cuba, five days after Santiago's death."
"01:27:57,648","01:28:04,570",I'll get you immunity. In about four days you can tell the court what you told me.
"01:28:04,738","01:28:08,950",Right now I'll check you into a motel. We're gonna start from the beginning.
"01:28:09,117","01:28:12,870","I don't want a deal, and I don't want immunity."
"01:28:13,038","01:28:19,293","I'm not proud of what I have done, nor of what I am doing."
"01:28:20,587","01:28:22,463",-Where is he? -The Downtown Lodge.
"01:28:22,631","01:28:24,715",-I want him guarded. -That's a good idea.
"01:28:24,883","01:28:27,385",-My clearance code is 4115273. -Clearance code?
"01:28:28,220","01:28:29,887",I don't have a clearance code. You?
"01:28:30,055","01:28:32,139",It's Galloway. I need to secure a witness.
"01:28:32,307","01:28:35,476",He also said Jessep's lying about transportation off the base.
"01:28:35,644","01:28:38,479",Jessep said that 6 the next morning was the first flight.
"01:28:38,647","01:28:41,899",Markinson says there was one that left seven hours earlier.
"01:28:42,067","01:28:45,027",-That was impressive. You hear that? -Yeah.
"01:28:45,195","01:28:47,738","Sam, isn't there a record of flights?"
"01:28:47,906","01:28:50,574",You need the tower chief's log from Gitmo.
"01:28:50,742","01:28:52,368",-Get it. -We're gonna win.
"01:28:52,536","01:28:55,997","Jo, don't get crazy. We don't know Markinson, or the log book."
"01:28:56,164","01:28:59,333","You concentrate on Downey, I'll talk to Ross."
"01:29:04,381","01:29:09,635","Hey, Danny. Nice work today. The redirect on Barnes."
"01:29:09,803","01:29:14,056",-I have Markinson. -Where is he?
"01:29:14,224","01:29:18,436","Motel room in Northeast, six marshals outside the door. Take a sip."
"01:29:18,603","01:29:20,896",The transfer Markinson signed is phony.
"01:29:21,064","01:29:24,483",And Jessep lied about the first flight. We're getting the log.
"01:29:24,651","01:29:26,110",-Can I get you something? -Beer.
"01:29:26,695","01:29:29,572","In the meantime, I'm gonna put Kendrick on the stand..."
"01:29:29,740","01:29:31,574",...and have some fun.
"01:29:31,742","01:29:36,662",If you accuse Kendrick or Jessep of any crime without evidence...
"01:29:36,830","01:29:39,457",...you'll be court-martialled for misconduct...
"01:29:39,624","01:29:44,045",...and that's gonna be stapled to every job application you ever fill out.
"01:29:45,839","01:29:49,633","Markinson won't hold up, he's a crazy man."
"01:29:49,801","01:29:52,970","I'm not saying this to intimidate you, I'm being your lawyer here."
"01:29:53,138","01:29:56,974",Thanks. And I wanna tell you I think the whole fucking bunch of you are insane.
"01:29:57,142","01:29:59,560",This code of honor makes me wanna beat someone!
"01:29:59,728","01:30:03,481",Don't you dare lump me in with Kendrick and Jessep.
"01:30:03,648","01:30:08,611","I'm your friend. Your clients don't belong in jail, but it's not my decision."
"01:30:08,779","01:30:13,157",I represent the U.S. government without passion or prejudice...
"01:30:13,325","01:30:16,243",-...and my client has a case. -Here you go.
"01:30:20,290","01:30:23,542",I want you to acknowledge that the judge advocate has made you aware...
"01:30:23,710","01:30:28,255",...of the consequences of accusing a Marine officer without evidence.
"01:30:29,091","01:30:30,966",I've been so advised.
"01:30:35,222","01:30:42,103",You got bullied into that courtroom. By everyone. By Dawson. By Galloway.
"01:30:42,270","01:30:44,522","Shit, I practically dared you."
"01:30:45,941","01:30:51,278",You got bullied into that courtroom by the memory of a dead lawyer.
"01:30:55,450","01:31:00,454","You're a lousy fucking softball player, Jack!"
"01:31:01,957","01:31:07,503","Your boys are going down, Danny. I can't stop it anymore."
"01:31:11,466","01:31:16,846",-Was Santiago a good Marine? -I'd say he was average.
"01:31:17,013","01:31:23,936",Your proficiency and conduct reports all indicate he was below average.
"01:31:27,524","01:31:31,277","Yes, he was below average."
"01:31:31,444","01:31:34,238",I did not see the need to trample on his grave.
"01:31:35,407","01:31:37,408","We appreciate it, but you're under oath."
"01:31:37,576","01:31:40,161",I think we'd all like to hear the truth.
"01:31:40,328","01:31:42,079",I'm aware of my oath.
"01:31:42,247","01:31:44,999",These are the last three pro-con reports you signed...
"01:31:45,167","01:31:47,293",...for Lance Corporal Dawson.
"01:31:47,460","01:31:53,549","He rated exceptional twice, but on June 9th he's below average."
"01:31:53,717","01:31:57,595",-I'd like to discuss that. -That would be fine.
"01:31:57,762","01:32:01,348",Dawson's ranking after the School of Infantry was perfect.
"01:32:01,516","01:32:06,729","But unlike most of his class, he hasn't been promoted."
"01:32:06,897","01:32:11,775",-Was this report the reason? -I'm sure it was.
"01:32:11,943","01:32:16,238",-Do you recall why he got this grade? -I'm sure I don't.
"01:32:16,406","01:32:20,117",I have many men in my charge. I write many reports.
"01:32:20,285","01:32:25,956",Do you recall an incident involving a PFC Curtis Bell...
"01:32:26,124","01:32:28,751",...stealing liquor from the officers' club?
"01:32:29,044","01:32:30,753","Yes, I do."
"01:32:30,921","01:32:35,049",Did you report Private Bell to the proper authorities?
"01:32:35,217","01:32:37,259",I have two books at my bedside:
"01:32:37,427","01:32:40,221",the Marine Code and the King James Bible.
"01:32:40,388","01:32:45,851",The only proper authorities I'm aware of are Colonel Jessep and God.
"01:32:47,395","01:32:52,733",Then you don't recognize this court as a proper authority?
"01:32:52,901","01:32:57,780",-Objection. Argumentative. -Sustained. Watch yourself.
"01:32:57,948","01:33:03,744",-Did you report Private Bell? -I thought very highly of him.
"01:33:03,912","01:33:06,664",I didn't want his record tarnished by a charge.
"01:33:07,749","01:33:10,668",You preferred it be handled in the unit?
"01:33:12,462","01:33:14,338","Yes, I most certainly did."
"01:33:15,382","01:33:18,801","-Do you know what a Code Red is? -Yes, I do."
"01:33:18,969","01:33:22,096","-Have you ever ordered one? -No, I have not."
"01:33:22,264","01:33:28,519",Did you order that Private Bell receive no food or drink except water...
"01:33:28,687","01:33:30,771",...for a period of seven days?
"01:33:30,939","01:33:35,526",You're distorting the truth. He was on barracks restriction.
"01:33:35,694","01:33:42,658",He was given water and vitamins. His health was never in danger.
"01:33:42,867","01:33:48,205",I'm sure it was lovely for him. But you did order the restriction.
"01:33:48,373","01:33:52,459","-You denied him food? -Yes, I did."
"01:33:52,627","01:33:59,049",-Wouldn't this be called a Code Red? -No.
"01:33:59,217","01:34:02,845",Would the other 478 Marines at Guantánamo...
"01:34:03,013","01:34:04,555",...consider it a Code Red?
"01:34:04,723","01:34:09,184",The witness can't testify as to what 478 other men would say.
"01:34:09,352","01:34:15,566","These questions are argumentative, and irrelevant badgering of the witness."
"01:34:15,734","01:34:19,403",Sustained. And I would remind you...
"01:34:19,571","01:34:23,574",...that you're questioning an officer with an impeccable service record.
"01:34:23,742","01:34:25,326","Thank you, Your Honor."
"01:34:26,202","01:34:32,916",Was Dawson rated below average for sneaking food to Private Bell?
"01:34:33,084","01:34:36,420",-Object! -Not so fast. Lieutenant?
"01:34:38,089","01:34:45,220",Dawson was given a below average rating for committing a crime.
"01:34:45,388","01:34:49,558",Crime? What crime did he commit?
"01:34:50,352","01:34:56,523","Lieutenant Kendrick, Dawson brought a hungry guy some food."
"01:34:56,691","01:35:01,779",-What crime did he commit? -He disobeyed an order.
"01:35:01,946","01:35:07,493",And because he made a decision about the welfare of a Marine...
"01:35:07,660","01:35:11,121","...that conflicted with your order, he was punished, right?"
"01:35:11,289","01:35:14,750",Lance Corporal Dawson disobeyed an order!
"01:35:14,918","01:35:19,671","It wasn't a real order, was it? After all, it's peacetime."
"01:35:19,839","01:35:22,966",He wasn't asked to advance on a beachhead.
"01:35:23,134","01:35:27,471",Surely a Marine of Dawson's intelligence...
"01:35:27,639","01:35:30,474",...can be trusted to distinguish important orders...
"01:35:30,642","01:35:34,603",...from those that might be morally questionable?
"01:35:35,980","01:35:39,775",Lieutenant Kendrick? Can he?
"01:35:39,943","01:35:43,404",Can Dawson determine on his own which orders to follow?
"01:35:43,571","01:35:45,155","No, he cannot."
"01:35:45,323","01:35:47,950",A lesson he learned after the Bell incident.
"01:35:48,118","01:35:50,452","-I would think so. -You know so, don't you?"
"01:35:50,662","01:35:52,663",-Object! -Sustained.
"01:35:55,166","01:35:57,876","Lieutenant Kendrick, one final question."
"01:35:58,878","01:36:02,256",If you had ordered Dawson to give Santiago a Code Red...
"01:36:02,424","01:36:06,510",-I ordered them not to touch him! -...would he dare disobey you again?
"01:36:06,678","01:36:10,681","-Lieutenant, don't answer that! -You don't have to. I'm through."
"01:36:11,141","01:36:18,856",Did you order Dawson and Downey to give Willy Santiago a Code Red?
"01:36:20,275","01:36:24,611","-Lieutenant Kendrick, did you--? -No, I did not."
"01:36:28,533","01:36:31,410",-What's the word? -Well...
"01:36:31,578","01:36:35,038",...I got the tower chief's log. Jessep's telling the truth.
"01:36:35,206","01:36:38,375",-Six a.m. flight was the first plane. -Let me see this.
"01:36:49,512","01:36:54,141","-Working late tonight, lieutenant? -Oh, yeah."
"01:36:56,978","01:37:00,606",There was no flight at 11:00! What the fuck are you trying to pull?!
"01:37:00,773","01:37:07,779",The first flight left at 23:00. It arrived at Andrews at 2 a.m.
"01:37:07,947","01:37:11,074",Really? Then why isn't it listed in the tower chief's log?
"01:37:13,077","01:37:18,916",-Jessep. -What? He fixed the logbook?
"01:37:19,083","01:37:22,669","Maybe he can make it so it didn't take off, but I can prove it landed."
"01:37:22,837","01:37:25,297",I'll get the logbook from Andrews.
"01:37:25,465","01:37:30,260",-You won't find anything. -He can make a flight disappear?
"01:37:30,887","01:37:32,804",Nathan Jessep is about to be appointed...
"01:37:32,972","01:37:34,932",...to the National Security Council.
"01:37:35,099","01:37:38,894",You don't get there without knowing how to sidestep a few landmines.
"01:37:39,062","01:37:41,480",He won't be able to sidestep you.
"01:37:42,023","01:37:44,274",You still intend to put me on the stand?
"01:37:44,442","01:37:47,277",Thursday morning. Ten o'clock.
"01:37:51,866","01:37:55,619",There's gotta be someone who can testify to the flight.
"01:37:55,787","01:38:01,917",This isn't TWA. You know how many planes take off and land every day?
"01:38:02,085","01:38:04,920",The ground crew isn't gonna remember it.
"01:38:05,088","01:38:06,255","Well, how do you know--"
"01:38:06,506","01:38:08,674",Forget the flight. Forget the flight.
"01:38:08,925","01:38:13,679",Markinson will testify that the transfer was forged.
"01:38:13,846","01:38:17,599",That and Downey's testimony really ought to be enough.
"01:38:23,356","01:38:27,317",Why did you go into Santiago's room on the night of the 6th?
"01:38:27,485","01:38:32,656",-To give him a Code Red. -And why did you do that?
"01:38:33,241","01:38:37,828",I was ordered to by the platoon commander...
"01:38:37,996","01:38:40,455",...Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick.
"01:38:41,624","01:38:43,667",You're gonna do fine.
"01:38:45,837","01:38:51,508",-Think we can rejoin the platoon soon? -Absolutely.
"01:38:54,804","01:39:00,225",Remember the order of the questions? Are you sure? And use small words.
"01:39:00,393","01:39:02,185",-Just go slow. -I'm gonna go slow.
"01:39:02,437","01:39:06,148",Okay. And get him off as fast as you can.
"01:39:06,399","01:39:08,775",What? It's gonna be fine.
"01:39:11,571","01:39:17,367","Dear Mr. and Mrs. Santiago, l was William's executive officer."
"01:39:17,535","01:39:20,871","I knew your son vaguely, which is to say I knew his name."
"01:39:21,873","01:39:26,793","Soon, the trial of the two men charged with his death will be concluded..."
"01:39:26,961","01:39:33,342",...and the jury will try to offer you an explanation as to why he's dead.
"01:39:33,509","01:39:37,346","For my part, I've done as much as I can to bring the truth to light."
"01:39:37,513","01:39:39,222",And the truth is this:
"01:39:39,390","01:39:41,892",Your son is dead for only one reason...
"01:39:42,268","01:39:44,895",...I wasn't strong enough to stop it.
"01:39:45,063","01:39:49,024","Always, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Andrew Markinson..."
"01:39:49,192","01:39:50,901",...United States Marine Corps.
"01:39:56,199","01:39:59,826","Private, I want you to tell us one last time:"
"01:39:59,994","01:40:05,916",Why did you go to Santiago's room on the night of September 6th?
"01:40:06,084","01:40:10,379",A Code Red was ordered by Platoon Commander Kendrick.
"01:40:10,546","01:40:14,424",Thank you. Your witness.
"01:40:18,930","01:40:22,015","The week of 2 September, the switch log..."
"01:40:22,183","01:40:25,936",...has you down at Post 39 until 16:00. Right?
"01:40:26,104","01:40:32,609",-They keep that log pretty good. -How far is Post 39 from barracks?
"01:40:32,777","01:40:38,990","-It's a ways, sir. It's a hike. -About how far by jeep?"
"01:40:40,576","01:40:42,536","About 10, 15 minutes, sir."
"01:40:42,704","01:40:46,623","-You ever had to walk it? -Yes, sir, that day. Friday."
"01:40:46,791","01:40:51,712",The pickup private-- That's what we call the guy that drops us off.
"01:40:51,879","01:40:55,841",Also because he can get the girls in New York City.
"01:40:56,008","01:41:03,056","--he got a flat tire at Post 39, so we had to jog back to barracks."
"01:41:03,224","01:41:09,938","And if it's 10 or 15 minutes by jeep, it must be an hour by foot, right?"
"01:41:10,106","01:41:16,027","-We did it in 45 flat, sir. -Not bad."
"01:41:16,195","01:41:22,617",You've said your assault on Santiago was ordered by Lieutenant Kendrick...
"01:41:22,785","01:41:27,622","...in your barracks room at 16:20, am I right?"
"01:41:27,790","01:41:28,957","Yes, sir."
"01:41:29,125","01:41:34,171",You said you weren't back before 16:45.
"01:41:34,338","01:41:35,589",Sir?
"01:41:35,757","01:41:39,509",If you weren't back till 16:45...
"01:41:39,677","01:41:42,012",...how could you be in your room at 16:20?
"01:41:42,764","01:41:45,849","Well, you see, sir, there was a blow-out...."
"01:41:46,017","01:41:47,851",Did you ever actually hear...
"01:41:48,019","01:41:49,853",...Lieutenant Kendrick order a Code Red?
"01:41:50,021","01:41:52,189","Well, Hal said that--"
"01:41:52,356","01:41:54,274",Did you ever actually hear...
"01:41:54,442","01:41:57,027",...Lieutenant Kendrick order a Code Red?
"01:41:58,070","01:42:02,157","-No, sir. -I'd like to request a recess."
"01:42:02,325","01:42:06,369",-The witness has rights! -He has been read his rights.
"01:42:06,537","01:42:07,954",The question will be repeated.
"01:42:08,206","01:42:13,460",Why did you go to Santiago's room? Did Dawson tell you to?
"01:42:13,628","01:42:17,214",-Don't look at him! -Answer the captain's question.
"01:42:20,551","01:42:25,722",Yes. I was given an order by Lance Corporal Dawson...
"01:42:25,890","01:42:27,641",...and I followed it.
"01:42:49,247","01:42:52,123",Where do you think he is?
"01:42:52,917","01:42:56,127","As far as Downey was concerned, it was an order from Kendrick."
"01:42:56,295","01:42:59,631",It doesn't matter that he didn't hear firsthand.
"01:43:05,137","01:43:09,891","-Danny, I'm sorry. -Don't worry about it."
"01:43:10,059","01:43:13,228",All we need to do is call some witnesses...
"01:43:13,396","01:43:15,188",...to talk about implied orders...
"01:43:15,356","01:43:18,108",...or call Downey back before we get to Dawson.
"01:43:18,776","01:43:23,613",Maybe we could get Dawson charged with the Kennedy assassination?
"01:43:26,784","01:43:33,290",-Are you drunk? -Pretty much. Yeah.
"01:43:34,166","01:43:37,627",I'll put on a pot of coffee. We've got a long night's work ahead.
"01:43:38,796","01:43:44,259",She's gonna make coffee? That's nice.
"01:43:48,180","01:43:54,394",Downey wasn't in his room. He wasn't even there.
"01:43:54,562","01:43:59,357","That was important information, don't you think?"
"01:44:00,109","01:44:04,696","Danny, it was a setback. And I'm sorry."
"01:44:04,864","01:44:08,950",But we fix it and move on to Markinson.
"01:44:09,118","01:44:10,619",Markinson's dead.
"01:44:16,542","01:44:20,879","You really got to hand it to those federal marshals, boy."
"01:44:21,047","01:44:23,423",He didn't hang himself by his shoelaces...
"01:44:23,591","01:44:27,177",...or slash his wrists with a butter knife.
"01:44:29,388","01:44:36,144","This guy got into full dress uniform, drew a nickel-plated pistol..."
"01:44:36,312","01:44:38,813",...and fired a bullet into his mouth.
"01:44:42,693","01:44:47,322","Anyway, since we're out of witnesses, I thought I'd drink a little."
"01:44:47,490","01:44:52,535",-I still think we can win. -Maybe you should drink a little.
"01:44:52,787","01:44:57,624","In the morning, we'll ask Randolph for a continuance, 24 hours."
"01:44:57,792","01:45:00,961",-Why would we do that? -To subpoena Colonel Jessep.
"01:45:02,046","01:45:03,755",-What? -Listen for a second.
"01:45:03,923","01:45:06,675",No! I won't listen.
"01:45:06,842","01:45:09,427","Your passion is compelling, but useless."
"01:45:09,595","01:45:13,515",Louden Downey needed a trial lawyer today.
"01:45:15,810","01:45:20,105",You chickenshit. You just want an excuse to give up.
"01:45:21,273","01:45:23,149",It's over.
"01:45:23,317","01:45:25,652",Why did you ask Jessep for the transfer order?
"01:45:25,820","01:45:28,446","-In Cuba, why did you ask him? -What does it matter?"
"01:45:28,614","01:45:31,199",-I wanted the damn transfer order! -Bullshit!
"01:45:31,367","01:45:34,744",You could have gotten it by calling any one of a dozen departments.
"01:45:34,912","01:45:39,582",You didn't want the order. You wanted to see Jessep's reaction.
"01:45:39,750","01:45:42,711",You had an instinct and it was confirmed by Markinson.
"01:45:42,878","01:45:45,714",Now let's put Jessep on the stand and end this thing.
"01:45:45,881","01:45:52,178",-What possible good would that do? -He ordered the Code Red.
"01:45:52,346","01:45:58,643","He did? That's great! And of course, you have proof?"
"01:45:58,811","01:46:02,939","I'm sorry, I forgot. You were sick that day at law school."
"01:46:03,107","01:46:05,442",You put him on the stand and get it from him.
"01:46:05,609","01:46:09,821","We get it from him! Yes, no problem. We get it from him."
"01:46:09,989","01:46:14,200","Colonel Jessep, isn't it true you ordered the Code Red on Santiago?"
"01:46:14,368","01:46:18,455","I'm sorry, time's run out! What do we have for the losers, judge?"
"01:46:18,622","01:46:22,834","“Well, for the defendants, it's life at exotic Fort Leavenworth!"
"01:46:23,002","01:46:28,757","And for Defense Counsel Kaffee, that's right, it's a court-martial!"
"01:46:28,924","01:46:34,345",After falsely accusing a decorated officer of conspiracy and perjury...
"01:46:34,513","01:46:38,016",...Lieutenant Kaffee will have a long and prosperous career...
"01:46:38,184","01:46:43,271",...teaching typewriter maintenance at a women's school!
"01:46:43,439","01:46:49,652",Thank you for playing Follow the Advice of the Galactically Stupid!”
"01:47:11,467","01:47:14,636",I'm sorry I lost you your set of steak knives.
"01:47:31,612","01:47:35,281",Stop cleaning up.
"01:47:37,201","01:47:41,412","Sam, stop cleaning up."
"01:47:49,004","01:47:54,008",-You want a drink? -Yeah.
"01:48:10,067","01:48:13,111",-Is your father proud of you? -Don't do this to yourself.
"01:48:13,279","01:48:15,029",I'll bet he is.
"01:48:15,906","01:48:19,117",I'll bet he bores the shit out of the neighbors and relatives.
"01:48:19,285","01:48:21,703",“Sam's made law review.
"01:48:21,871","01:48:27,959",He's got a big case he's making. He's making an argument.”
"01:48:32,381","01:48:38,261",I think my father would have enjoyed seeing me graduate from law school.
"01:48:40,222","01:48:44,309",I think he would have liked that a lot.
"01:48:45,394","01:48:48,396",I ever tell you I wrote a paper about your father in college?
"01:48:49,398","01:48:50,899",Yeah?
"01:48:51,567","01:48:56,946","-One of the best trial lawyers ever. -Yes, he was."
"01:48:57,198","01:49:02,243","But if I were Dawson and Downey, and had to choose you or him..."
"01:49:02,411","01:49:05,455","...I'd choose you any day of the week, and twice on Sunday."
"01:49:06,123","01:49:09,626",You should have seen yourself thunder away at Kendrick.
"01:49:12,087","01:49:16,799",-Would you put Jessep on the stand? -No.
"01:49:17,426","01:49:22,347",Do you think my father would have? -With the evidence we got?
"01:49:22,514","01:49:25,308",Not in a million years.
"01:49:25,476","01:49:29,020","But here's the thing, and we can't get around this:"
"01:49:29,188","01:49:31,105",Neither Lionel Kaffee nor Sam Weinberg...
"01:49:31,273","01:49:36,361",...are lead counsel for the defense in U.S. v. Dawson and Downey.
"01:49:36,528","01:49:40,990",So there's really only one question: What would you do?
"01:49:49,375","01:49:53,753","Jo. Joanne! Jo, get in the car."
"01:49:53,921","01:49:57,298","Joanne, please get in the car! Look...."
"01:49:58,759","01:50:02,929",JoAnne! I apologize. I was angry.
"01:50:03,097","01:50:05,682",I'm sorry about what I said.
"01:50:05,849","01:50:09,936",I'm gonna put Jessep on the stand!
"01:50:28,998","01:50:30,206",What do you suggest we do?
"01:50:30,374","01:50:32,917",Hit Jessep with the phony transfer order.
"01:50:33,085","01:50:35,378",-Without a witness? -We have a witness.
"01:50:35,546","01:50:36,546",A dead witness.
"01:50:36,714","01:50:39,340","To a lesser attorney, that'd be a problem."
"01:50:39,508","01:50:44,387","Look. Last night he's swimming in Jack Daniel's, today he's Superman!"
"01:50:44,555","01:50:49,600","I'm getting my second wind. Sit down, both of you. Good."
"01:50:49,768","01:50:51,728",Jessep told Kendrick to order the Code Red...
"01:50:51,895","01:50:53,938","...Kendrick did, our clients followed orders."
"01:50:54,106","01:50:59,360","The cover-up isn't our case. To win, Jessep has to say he gave the order."
"01:50:59,945","01:51:03,156",-And you can get him to say it? -I think he wants to say it!
"01:51:03,324","01:51:06,451",I think he's pissed off he's gotta hide. I think he wants to say...
"01:51:06,618","01:51:09,746","...he made a decision, and that's the end of it!"
"01:51:09,913","01:51:15,501",He eats breakfast 300 yards from 4000 Cubans that are trained to kill him.
"01:51:15,669","01:51:17,754",And no one tells him how to run his unit...
"01:51:17,921","01:51:20,840",...least of all the Harvard mouth in his faggoty white uniform.
"01:51:21,008","01:51:25,428",I need to shake him. I'll lead him right where he's dying to go.
"01:51:25,596","01:51:28,264",-That's it? That's the plan? -That's the plan.
"01:51:28,432","01:51:30,099",How are you going to do it?
"01:51:30,267","01:51:33,770",-I have no idea. I need my bat. -Your what?
"01:51:33,937","01:51:36,272",I need my bat. I think better with it. Where is it?
"01:51:36,440","01:51:39,609",-I put it in the closet. -You put it in the closet?
"01:51:39,860","01:51:41,527",I was tripping on it.
"01:51:41,695","01:51:43,780",Don't ever put that bat in the closet.
"01:51:59,171","01:52:01,839",Stay here. I'm going to the office for a while.
"01:52:04,635","01:52:07,220",He does think better with that bat.
"01:52:28,659","01:52:32,995","-Hello? -Sam, I need you to do something."
"01:52:36,458","01:52:39,752",-What's going on? -Gotta go out to Andrews.
"01:53:03,485","01:53:07,780",-Did Sam get the guys? -Yes.
"01:53:07,948","01:53:12,243","-Can I talk to you for a second? -Yeah, sure."
"01:53:23,297","01:53:24,714",How are you feeling?
"01:53:26,133","01:53:30,511","Well, I think Jessep's gonna have his hands full today."
"01:53:32,931","01:53:37,310","Listen, Danny, when you're out there today..."
"01:53:37,478","01:53:44,358","...if you feel like it's not gonna happen, like he's not going to say it..."
"01:53:44,526","01:53:49,572",...don't go for it. You could get into trouble.
"01:53:50,324","01:53:54,660",I'm special counsel for Internal Affairs. I'm telling you you could get in trouble.
"01:53:54,828","01:54:00,958",You're not suggesting that I back off a material witness?
"01:54:01,418","01:54:04,253","If you think you can't get him, yeah."
"01:54:06,632","01:54:08,216",All rise!
"01:54:13,305","01:54:15,723",-Where's Sam? -He's on his way.
"01:54:21,647","01:54:22,897",Call your first witness.
"01:54:23,065","01:54:25,525",-Where is he? -He'll be here. Don't worry.
"01:54:25,692","01:54:28,444",Lieutenant! Call your witness.
"01:54:35,327","01:54:37,745",Defense calls Colonel Nathan Jessep.
"01:54:54,346","01:54:57,306","Colonel Jessep, raise your right hand, please, sir."
"01:54:57,474","01:55:04,355","Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?"
"01:55:04,648","01:55:09,068","-Yes, I do. -Have a seat please, sir."
"01:55:09,236","01:55:12,488","State your name, rank and current billet for the record."
"01:55:13,323","01:55:16,867","Colonel Jessep, Commanding Officer, Marine Ground Forces..."
"01:55:17,035","01:55:19,078","...Guantánamo Bay, Cuba."
"01:55:19,246","01:55:22,665","-Thank you, sir. -He's not here."
"01:55:27,504","01:55:31,048",When you learned of Santiago's letter to the NIS...
"01:55:31,216","01:55:34,844","...you had a meeting with your two senior officers, is that right?"
"01:55:35,012","01:55:36,846",Yes.
"01:55:37,014","01:55:39,682",Platoon Commander Kendrick...
"01:55:39,850","01:55:43,561","...and the executive officer, Lieutenant Colonel Markinson."
"01:55:44,104","01:55:45,187",Yes.
"01:55:45,355","01:55:49,775","And, at present, Markinson is dead, is that right?"
"01:55:49,943","01:55:57,366",-What is the counselor implying? -Simply that Markinson is not alive.
"01:55:57,534","01:56:01,203",Surely Colonel Jessep doesn't need to confirm that.
"01:56:01,371","01:56:06,459",He may not be aware that Markinson took his own life two days ago.
"01:56:06,627","01:56:11,422","The witness, the court and now the court members are aware."
"01:56:11,590","01:56:16,552","We thank you for bringing it up. Move on, lieutenant."
"01:56:16,720","01:56:18,387","Yes, sir."
"01:56:18,555","01:56:22,099","At this meeting, you gave Kendrick an order, right?"
"01:56:22,267","01:56:26,479",I told him to tell his men not to touch Santiago.
"01:56:26,813","01:56:29,523",And did you give an order to Markinson as well?
"01:56:29,691","01:56:35,446",I ordered him to have Santiago transferred off the base immediately.
"01:56:35,614","01:56:40,826",-Why? -I felt his life might be in danger.
"01:56:41,244","01:56:45,581",-Grave danger? -Is there another kind?
"01:56:48,502","01:56:52,588",This is the transfer order that you and Markinson co-signed...
"01:56:52,756","01:56:56,884",...ordering that Santiago fly out at 6 the next morning.
"01:56:57,052","01:57:02,014",-Was that the first flight off the base? -The 06:00 was the first flight.
"01:57:06,228","01:57:09,271","-You flew here today, is that right? -Yes."
"01:57:09,439","01:57:14,276","-You're wearing your dress uniform. -As are you, lieutenant."
"01:57:14,444","01:57:18,989",-Did you wear it on the plane? -Is this dialogue relevant to anything?
"01:57:19,157","01:57:23,285",We didn't have a chance to depose. I'd ask the court for a little latitude.
"01:57:23,453","01:57:27,581",-A very little latitude. -Colonel?
"01:57:27,749","01:57:29,667",I wore utilities on the plane.
"01:57:29,835","01:57:32,795",-You brought your dress uniform? -Yes.
"01:57:32,963","01:57:35,965","-Toothbrush, shaving kit, underwear? -Your Honor!"
"01:57:36,133","01:57:38,551",Is his underwear a matter of national security?
"01:57:38,719","01:57:42,138","Gentlemen. You'd better get somewhere fast with this, lieutenant."
"01:57:42,305","01:57:44,306","Yes, sir. Colonel?"
"01:57:45,183","01:57:49,145",I brought a change of clothes and some personal items.
"01:57:49,771","01:57:51,230",Thank you.
"01:57:51,398","01:57:54,817",After Dawson and Downey's arrest on the night of the 6th...
"01:57:54,985","01:57:59,280","...Santiago's barracks room was sealed off, and its contents inventoried."
"01:57:59,448","01:58:04,034","Four pairs of camouflage pants, three khaki shirts, three pairs of boots."
"01:58:04,202","01:58:09,498",-Four pairs green socks-- -Is there a question in our future?
"01:58:09,833","01:58:12,501","Lieutenant, state your question."
"01:58:13,003","01:58:15,796",I'm wondering why Santiago wasn't packed.
"01:58:18,383","01:58:21,469","Tell you what, we'll get back to that one in a minute."
"01:58:21,636","01:58:25,473",This is a record of all phone calls from your base in the past 24 hours.
"01:58:25,640","01:58:28,893","After being subpoenaed, you made three calls."
"01:58:29,060","01:58:31,520",Do you recognize those numbers?
"01:58:31,688","01:58:37,443",I called Colonel Fitzhughes to let him know I'd be in town.
"01:58:37,611","01:58:43,282",The second was to arrange a meeting with Congressman Richman.
"01:58:43,450","01:58:48,537",-And the third call was to my sister. -Why did you make that call?
"01:58:48,997","01:58:52,041",-I thought she might like to have dinner. -Your Honor.
"01:58:52,209","01:58:53,542",I'll put a stop to this.
"01:58:53,710","01:58:57,463",These are the phone records from Gitmo for September 6th.
"01:58:57,631","01:59:02,927",And these are 14 letters that Santiago wrote in nine months...
"01:59:03,094","01:59:06,347","...requesting, begging for a transfer."
"01:59:06,515","01:59:09,308",Upon hearing the news he was getting it...
"01:59:09,476","01:59:11,268",...Santiago was so excited...
"01:59:11,436","01:59:15,689",...you know how many people he called? Zero! Nobody.
"01:59:16,107","01:59:19,568","Not one call to his parents, saying he was coming home."
"01:59:19,736","01:59:23,197","Not one call to a friend, saying, “Can you pick me up?”"
"01:59:23,365","01:59:29,411","He was asleep at midnight, and you say he had a flight in six hours."
"01:59:29,579","01:59:35,918",Yet everything he owned was in his closet or his footlocker.
"01:59:36,086","01:59:39,588","You were leaving for one day, you packed and made three calls."
"01:59:39,756","01:59:45,970",Santiago was leaving for the rest of his life...
"01:59:46,137","01:59:50,975","...and he hadn't called a soul, and he hadn't packed a thing."
"01:59:54,688","01:59:56,272",Can you explain that?
"01:59:59,150","02:00:03,863","Fact is, there was no transfer order. Santiago wasn't going anywhere, right?"
"02:00:04,030","02:00:09,785",Objection! Lieutenant Kaffee is trying to smear a high-ranking Marine officer...
"02:00:09,953","02:00:12,288",...desperately hoping to suggest impropriety...
"02:00:12,455","02:00:14,331",...and win points with the court.
"02:00:14,499","02:00:17,585",I recommend that he be reprimanded...
"02:00:17,752","02:00:21,589",...and the witness be excused with apologies.
"02:00:22,173","02:00:28,596",-Overruled. The objection is noted. -Colonel?
"02:00:32,684","02:00:37,146","-Is this funny, sir? -No, it's not. It's tragic."
"02:00:37,314","02:00:44,153",-Do you have an answer? -Absolutely. I don't have a damn clue.
"02:00:44,321","02:00:50,659",Maybe he was an early riser. Maybe he didn't have any friends.
"02:00:50,827","02:00:54,246","I'm an educated man, but I can't speak intelligently..."
"02:00:54,414","02:00:58,000",...about the travel habits of William Santiago.
"02:00:58,168","02:01:02,963",What I do know is that he was set to leave the base at 06:00.
"02:01:03,798","02:01:08,719","Now, are these really the questions that I was called here to answer?"
"02:01:08,887","02:01:11,347",Phone calls and foot lockers?
"02:01:11,806","02:01:15,142","Please tell me you have something more, lieutenant."
"02:01:15,352","02:01:18,938",These two Marines are on trial for their lives.
"02:01:19,105","02:01:25,861",Please tell me their lawyer hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone bill.
"02:01:26,279","02:01:29,365","Do you have any other questions for me, counselor?"
"02:01:38,249","02:01:40,876",Lieutenant Kaffee?
"02:01:48,218","02:01:52,554","Lieutenant, do you have anything further for this witness?"
"02:01:59,354","02:02:04,149","-Thanks, Danny. I love Washington. -Excuse me. I didn't dismiss you."
"02:02:05,151","02:02:09,780",I beg your pardon? -I'm not through with my examination.
"02:02:09,948","02:02:11,573",Sit down.
"02:02:13,410","02:02:15,911",-“Colonel.” -What's that?
"02:02:16,079","02:02:20,416",I'd appreciate if he would address me as “colonel” or “sir.” I've earned it.
"02:02:21,001","02:02:24,545",Defense counsel will address him “colonel” or “sir”.
"02:02:24,713","02:02:27,756",I don't know what the hell kind of unit you're running here.
"02:02:27,924","02:02:31,510",And the witness will address me as “judge” or “Your Honor.”
"02:02:31,678","02:02:33,512",I'm quite certain I've earned it.
"02:02:34,264","02:02:38,225","Take your seat, colonel."
"02:02:41,396","02:02:45,566",What shall we discuss now? My favorite color?
"02:02:46,568","02:02:49,194","Colonel, the 6 a.m. flight was the first off the base?"
"02:02:49,362","02:02:50,946",Yes.
"02:02:51,114","02:02:55,200",There wasn't one seven hours earlier and landed at Andrews at 2 a.m.?
"02:02:55,368","02:02:58,245","I think we've covered this, haven't we?"
"02:02:59,080","02:03:04,293",These are the tower chief's logs for Guantánamo Bay and Andrews.
"02:03:04,794","02:03:10,299","There's no flight at 11 p.m., and no arrival at 2 a.m."
"02:03:10,467","02:03:13,802",I'd like to admit them as Defense Exhibits Alpha and Bravo.
"02:03:13,970","02:03:17,389",You're admitting evidence of a flight that never existed.
"02:03:17,557","02:03:19,975","We believe it did, sir."
"02:03:20,143","02:03:26,148",We call Airmen O'Malley and Rodriguez of Andrews Air Base.
"02:03:26,316","02:03:33,739",-They weren't on the list. -They are rebuttal witnesses.
"02:03:33,907","02:03:36,742",-I'll allow the witnesses. -This is ridiculous!
"02:03:37,077","02:03:38,410","Colonel, a moment ago--"
"02:03:38,578","02:03:44,333","-Check the logs, for chrissake! -We'll get to that in a minute."
"02:03:45,418","02:03:51,465",You said you ordered Kendrick to say that Santiago wasn't to be touched.
"02:03:51,633","02:03:53,092",That's right.
"02:03:53,259","02:03:57,763",-He was clear on what you wanted? -Crystal.
"02:03:58,681","02:04:03,018",-Could he have ignored the order? -Ignored the order?
"02:04:03,186","02:04:06,188",-Or forgot about it? -No.
"02:04:06,356","02:04:10,359","Any chance he could have thought, “The old man is wrong”?"
"02:04:10,985","02:04:12,361",No.
"02:04:12,529","02:04:18,033","When Lt. Kendrick talked to the men, any chance they ignored him?"
"02:04:19,494","02:04:23,413","-You ever served in the infantry, son? -No, sir."
"02:04:23,581","02:04:27,126","-Ever served in a forward area? -No, sir."
"02:04:27,544","02:04:32,881","Ever put your life in another man's hands, and his in yours?"
"02:04:33,049","02:04:34,383","No, sir."
"02:04:34,551","02:04:39,096","We follow orders, son. We follow orders or people die."
"02:04:39,264","02:04:42,391",It's that simple. Are we clear?
"02:04:43,101","02:04:44,351","Yes, sir."
"02:04:44,519","02:04:48,897",-Are we clear? -Crystal.
"02:04:50,608","02:04:54,820","Just one more question, before I call Airmen O'Malley and Rodriguez."
"02:04:56,114","02:05:00,409",If you ordered that Santiago wasn't to be touched...
"02:05:00,910","02:05:04,705",...and your orders are always followed...
"02:05:04,873","02:05:09,084",...then why would Santiago be in danger?
"02:05:10,044","02:05:13,755",Why would it be necessary to transfer him off the base?
"02:05:19,554","02:05:23,849",Santiago was a substandard Marine. He was being transferred--
"02:05:24,017","02:05:27,978",You said he was being transferred because he was in grave danger.
"02:05:28,146","02:05:30,272",-That's correct. -You said he was in danger.
"02:05:30,440","02:05:32,608","-I said, “grave danger?” You said-- -I recall--"
"02:05:32,775","02:05:34,276",I can have the reporter read--
"02:05:34,444","02:05:37,362",I know what I said! I don't have to have it read back--
"02:05:37,530","02:05:41,033",Then why the two orders? Colonel?
"02:05:43,161","02:05:45,621",Sometimes men take matters into their own hands.
"02:05:45,788","02:05:48,707","No, sir. You made it clear your men never do."
"02:05:48,875","02:05:53,587","Your men follow orders or people die. So Santiago wasn't in danger, right?"
"02:05:53,755","02:05:55,881",You snotty little bastard.
"02:05:56,049","02:05:59,259","-Your Honor, I ask for a recess. -I'd like an answer."
"02:05:59,427","02:06:01,220",The court will wait for an answer.
"02:06:02,055","02:06:07,851",If Lt. Kendrick gave an order that Santiago wasn't to be touched...
"02:06:08,019","02:06:12,272",...why did he have to be transferred? Colonel?
"02:06:12,440","02:06:16,193",Kendrick ordered a Code Red because that's what you told him to do!
"02:06:16,361","02:06:17,486",Object!
"02:06:17,654","02:06:23,867","And when it went bad, you signed a phony transfer and doctored the logs!"
"02:06:24,035","02:06:25,702",You coerced the doctor!
"02:06:25,870","02:06:28,997","Colonel Jessep, did you order the Code Red?"
"02:06:29,165","02:06:32,417",-You don't have to answer that. -I'll answer the question.
"02:06:32,585","02:06:34,836",-You want answers? -I think I'm entitled!
"02:06:35,004","02:06:37,256",-You want answers? -I want the truth!
"02:06:37,423","02:06:40,550",You can't handle the truth!
"02:06:40,718","02:06:45,013","Son, we live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded."
"02:06:45,181","02:06:49,685","Who's gonna do it? You? You, Lieutenant Weinberg?"
"02:06:49,852","02:06:53,689",I have a greater responsibility than you can possible fathom.
"02:06:53,856","02:06:57,192",You weep for Santiago and you curse the Marines.
"02:06:57,360","02:07:01,196",You have that luxury. The luxury of not knowing what I know:
"02:07:01,364","02:07:05,325","That Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives."
"02:07:05,493","02:07:11,290","And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives!"
"02:07:11,457","02:07:13,417",You don't want the truth because deep down...
"02:07:13,584","02:07:15,711",...in places you don't talk about at parties...
"02:07:15,878","02:07:20,590",...you want me on that wall. You need me on that wall.
"02:07:20,758","02:07:25,262","We use words like honor, code, loyalty."
"02:07:25,430","02:07:28,849",We use them as the backbone of a life spent defending something.
"02:07:29,017","02:07:31,059",You use them as a punchline!
"02:07:31,227","02:07:34,980",I have neither the time nor inclination to explain myself...
"02:07:35,148","02:07:39,609",...to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the freedom I provide...
"02:07:39,777","02:07:42,154",...then questions the manner in which I provide it!
"02:07:42,322","02:07:45,365",I would rather you just said “thank you” and went on your way.
"02:07:45,533","02:07:49,286","Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post."
"02:07:49,454","02:07:54,249","Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you are entitled to!"
"02:07:54,417","02:07:56,918",-Did you order the Code Red? -I did the job--
"02:07:57,086","02:08:00,422",-Did you order the Code Red? -You're goddamn right I did!
"02:08:11,476","02:08:14,311",I suggest the members be dismissed...
"02:08:14,479","02:08:17,898",...so we can move to an article 39A session.
"02:08:18,066","02:08:22,694",-The witness has rights. -Captain Ross?
"02:08:27,241","02:08:28,867",Jack?
"02:08:33,873","02:08:37,250",The members of the court will retire until further instructed.
"02:08:37,960","02:08:39,920",All rise.
"02:08:40,463","02:08:42,756",What the hell is this?
"02:08:42,924","02:08:46,510","Colonel, what's going on? I did my job, I'd do it again."
"02:08:46,677","02:08:51,473",-I'm going back to my base. -You're not going anywhere.
"02:08:51,641","02:08:55,936","-MP's, guard the colonel! -Yes, sir."
"02:08:57,188","02:08:59,856",-Captain Ross. -What the hell is this?
"02:09:00,108","02:09:02,484","Colonel Jessep, you have the right to remain silent."
"02:09:02,652","02:09:07,072",I'm being charged with a crime? Is that what this is?
"02:09:07,240","02:09:10,492",I'm being charged with a crime?
"02:09:10,660","02:09:14,704","This is funny, that's what this is! This is--"
"02:09:14,872","02:09:18,166",I'm gonna rip the eyes out of your head and piss in your dead skull!
"02:09:18,334","02:09:20,252",You fucked with the wrong Marine!
"02:09:20,420","02:09:24,881","Colonel Jessep, do you understand your rights?"
"02:09:29,846","02:09:32,472",You fucking people.
"02:09:32,640","02:09:35,517",You have no idea how to defend a nation.
"02:09:36,185","02:09:41,148","All you did was weaken a country today, Kaffee! That's all you did."
"02:09:41,315","02:09:46,319","You put peoples' lives in danger. Sweet dreams, son."
"02:09:46,487","02:09:48,530",Don't call me son.
"02:09:48,698","02:09:52,868","I'm a lawyer, and an officer in the United States Navy."
"02:09:53,035","02:09:55,871","And you're under arrest, you son of a bitch."
"02:10:00,042","02:10:02,169",The witness is excused.
"02:10:24,275","02:10:27,736",All rise!
"02:10:36,871","02:10:41,583","-Have you reached a verdict? -We have, sir."
"02:10:52,303","02:10:57,849","Lance Corporal Dawson, Private First Class Downey."
"02:10:59,018","02:11:03,271","On the charge of murder, the members find the accused..."
"02:11:03,439","02:11:05,690",...not guilty.
"02:11:06,442","02:11:10,320",On the charge of conspiracy to commit murder...
"02:11:10,488","02:11:15,742",...the members find the accused not guilty.
"02:11:16,619","02:11:20,747",On the charge of conduct unbecoming a United States Marine...
"02:11:20,915","02:11:26,836",...the members find the accused guilty as charged.
"02:11:28,214","02:11:31,466",The accused are sentenced to time already served...
"02:11:31,634","02:11:36,429",...and are ordered to be dishonorably discharged from the Marine Corps.
"02:11:37,682","02:11:40,058",This court-martial is adjourned.
"02:11:40,226","02:11:41,893",All rise.
"02:11:57,493","02:11:59,995",What did that mean?
"02:12:01,789","02:12:04,624",Hal?
"02:12:04,792","02:12:07,836",What did that mean?
"02:12:09,964","02:12:15,010",I don't understand. Colonel Jessep said he ordered the Code Red.
"02:12:15,177","02:12:19,431",-He ordered it. What did we do wrong? -It's not that simple.
"02:12:19,599","02:12:23,351","-We did nothing wrong! -Yeah, we did."
"02:12:26,439","02:12:31,359",We were supposed to fight for people who couldn't fight for themselves.
"02:12:31,527","02:12:34,154",We were supposed to fight for Willy.
"02:12:40,536","02:12:46,458","Lieutenant Kaffee, I have to take these men for some paperwork."
"02:12:55,426","02:12:58,386",Harold?
"02:13:00,514","02:13:03,350",Sir?
"02:13:03,517","02:13:06,061",You don't need a patch on your arm to have honor.
"02:13:09,774","02:13:14,736",Ten-hut! There's an officer on deck.
"02:13:39,553","02:13:44,891","O'Malley and Rodriguez, what exactly could they testify to?"
"02:13:45,059","02:13:50,188",Probably that they had absolutely no recollection of anything.
"02:13:50,356","02:13:55,193","-Strong witnesses. -And handsome too, didn't you think?"
"02:13:55,361","02:13:57,904",I'll see you around. I gotta go arrest Kendrick.
"02:13:58,072","02:14:00,532",Tell him I say hi.
"02:14:00,700","02:14:04,786",Will do.
