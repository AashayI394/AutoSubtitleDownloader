Pulp.Fiction,"00:00:28,340","00:00:32,428",Forget it. It's too risky. I'm through doing that shit.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:00:32,508","00:00:35,966",You always say that. The same thing every time.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:00:36,038","00:00:37,977","""l'm through, never again, too dangerous."""
Pulp.Fiction,"00:00:38,048","00:00:40,537",I know that's what I always say. I'm always right too.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:00:40,617","00:00:44,015",- You forget about it in a day or two. - The days of me forgetting are over.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:00:44,087","00:00:46,176",The days of me remembering have just begun.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:00:46,248","00:00:48,417","You know, when you go on like this, what you sound like ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:00:48,488","00:00:51,516",- I sound like a sensible fuckin' man. - You sound like a duck.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:00:51,588","00:00:55,046","- Quack, quack, quack. - Take heart, 'cause you're never gonna have to hear it again."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:00:55,127","00:00:58,615","Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna have to hear me quack."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:00:58,696","00:01:03,425",- After tonight ? - Correct. I got all tonight to quack.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:01:03,506","00:01:06,335","- Can I get anyone more coffee ? - Oh, yes !"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:01:08,136","00:01:10,695",- Thank you. - You're welcome.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:01:10,776","00:01:13,864","I mean, the way it is now,"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:01:13,946","00:01:16,745",you're takin' the same risk as when you rob a bank.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:01:16,815","00:01:18,874",Takin' more of a risk. Banks are easier.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:01:18,945","00:01:21,973",Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you in any way during a robbery.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:01:22,056","00:01:26,284",They're insured. Why should they give a fuck ? I don't even need a gun in a Federal bank.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:01:26,356","00:01:29,814","Heard about this one bloke, he walks into a bank with a portable phone."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:01:29,895","00:01:32,864","He gives the phone to a teller. The bloke on the other end says,"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:01:32,925","00:01:36,493","""We got this guy's little girl. If you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill her."""
Pulp.Fiction,"00:01:36,565","00:01:39,364",- Did it work ? - Fuckin' right it worked. That's what I'm talkin' about.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:01:39,434","00:01:45,273","Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone. Not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:01:45,345","00:01:49,974",- Cleans the place out. They don't lift a fuckin' finger. - Did they hurt the little girl ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:01:50,044","00:01:53,742",There probably never was a little girl. The point of the story isn't a little girl.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:01:53,814","00:01:56,802",The point of the story is they robbed a bank with a telephone.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:01:56,883","00:01:59,852",- You want to rob banks ? - I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:01:59,924","00:02:02,353","I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be easier than what we've been doing."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:02:02,424","00:02:06,582","-No more liquor stores ? -What've we been talkin' about ? Yeah, no more liquor stores."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:02:06,663","00:02:09,632","Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be. There's too many foreigners own liquor stores."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:02:09,692","00:02:11,631","Vietnamese, Koreans, don't even speak fuckin' English."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:02:11,703","00:02:14,062","You tell 'em empty out the register, they don't know what you're talkin' about."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:02:14,132","00:02:16,071",They make it too personal.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:02:16,133","00:02:20,371","- We keep on, one of these gook fuckers gonna make us kill him. - I'm not gonna kill anybody."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:02:20,443","00:02:24,741",I don't want to either. But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us or them.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:02:24,812","00:02:26,741","And if it's not the gooks,"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:02:26,812","00:02:29,441",it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned the store for 15 fucking generations.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:02:29,512","00:02:33,950",You got Grandpa lrving sitting behind the counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:02:34,022","00:02:35,951",Try walkin' into one of those places with nothing but a phone.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:02:36,022","00:02:37,961",See how far that gets you. Forget it.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:02:38,022","00:02:40,961","- We're out of it. - Well, what then, day jobs ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:02:41,031","00:02:43,050",- Not in this life. - What then ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:02:45,230","00:02:47,429","GarÃ§on, coffee !"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:02:47,501","00:02:49,800",This place.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:02:51,271","00:02:54,359",GarÃ§on means boy.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:02:57,610","00:03:00,269",This place ? A coffee shop ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:03:00,350","00:03:03,309",What's wrong with that ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:03:03,379","00:03:07,037",Nobody ever robs restaurants. Why not ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:03:08,019","00:03:10,448","Bars, liquor stores,"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:03:10,520","00:03:14,248",gas stations; you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:03:14,330","00:03:17,988","Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:03:18,059","00:03:21,757",They're not expectin' to get robbed. Not as expectin' anyway.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:03:21,828","00:03:26,327",- I bet you could cut down on the hero factor in a place like this. - Correct.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:03:26,398","00:03:29,666","Same as banks, these places are insured."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:03:29,738","00:03:32,107",Manager. He don't give a fuck.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:03:32,179","00:03:35,008",They're just trying to get you out before you start pluggin' the diners.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:03:35,078","00:03:39,036",Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it. No way they're takin' a bullet for the register.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:03:39,117","00:03:42,046",Busboys. Some wetback gettin' paid $1.50 an hour...
Pulp.Fiction,"00:03:42,117","00:03:44,646",really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:03:44,718","00:03:47,816","Customers sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:03:47,887","00:03:52,556","One minute, they're havin' a Denver omelet, the next, someone is stickin' a gun in their face."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:03:52,627","00:03:57,686","See, I got the idea the last liquor store we stuck up, remember ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:03:57,766","00:04:00,465",- All the customers kept comin' in. - Yeah.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:04:00,536","00:04:04,364","You got the idea of takin' their wallets. Now, that was a good idea."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:04:04,437","00:04:07,835",- Thank you. - Made more from the wallets than we did from the register.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:04:07,907","00:04:10,206","- Yes, we did. - A lot of people come to restaurants."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:04:10,276","00:04:13,934","- A lot of wallets. - Pretty smart, huh ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:04:14,016","00:04:16,035",Pretty smart.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:04:17,585","00:04:20,613","I'm ready. Let's do it. Right now, right here."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:04:20,686","00:04:25,185","- Come on. - All right. Same as last time, remember ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:04:25,256","00:04:28,025",You're crowd control. I'll handle the employees.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:04:33,604","00:04:36,373","- I love you, Pumpkin. - I love you, Honey Bunny."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:04:37,574","00:04:40,073",Everybody be cool ! This is a robbery !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:04:40,145","00:04:43,014","Any of you fucking pricks move,"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:04:43,085","00:04:46,983",and I'll execute every motherfuckin' last one of you.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:04:46,984","00:04:47,313",and I'll execute every motherfuckin' last one of you.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:06:38,497","00:06:40,726",-  Jungle boogie -  Get down with the boogie

Pulp.Fiction,"00:07:04,366","00:07:08,464","- Okay, so tell me again about the hash bars. - Okay, what you want to know ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:07:08,536","00:07:11,375","- Hash is legal there, right ? - It's legal, but it ain't 100% legal."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:07:11,446","00:07:16,075","You just can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint and start puffin' away."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:07:16,145","00:07:19,473","I mean, they want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:07:19,546","00:07:22,215",- Those are hash bars ? - Yeah. It breaks down like this.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:07:22,285","00:07:24,614",It's legal to buy it. It's legal to own it.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:07:24,685","00:07:27,883","And if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:07:27,955","00:07:32,353","It's illegal to carry it, but-but that doesn't matter, 'cause get a load of this."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:07:32,425","00:07:36,883","If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam, it's illegal for them to search you."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:07:36,965","00:07:40,903","- I mean, that's a right the cops in Amsterdam don't have. - Oh, man ! I'm goin'."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:07:40,964","00:07:43,493",That's all there is to it. I'm fuckin' goin'.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:07:43,574","00:07:46,503","I know, baby. You'd dig it the most."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:07:46,574","00:07:49,303",- But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is ? - What ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:07:49,373","00:07:53,311","It's the little differences. I mean, they got the same shit over there that they got here,"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:07:53,383","00:07:56,941","- but it's just there, it's a little different. - Example."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:07:57,014","00:08:00,142",You can walk into a movie theater in Amsterdam and buy a beer.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:08:00,224","00:08:03,852",And I don't mean just like no paper cup. I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:08:03,923","00:08:07,751","And in Paris, you can buy a beer in McDonald's. You know what they call..."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:08:07,823","00:08:11,321",a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in Paris ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:08:11,402","00:08:13,591",They don't call it a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:08:13,663","00:08:16,462",They got the metric system. They wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter-Pounder is.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:08:16,532","00:08:20,440",- What do they call it ? - They call it a Royale with Cheese.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:08:20,502","00:08:21,971",- Royale with Cheese. - That's right.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:08:22,042","00:08:23,971",What do they call a Big Mac ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:08:24,042","00:08:27,340","Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:08:27,411","00:08:30,539",Le Big Mac.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:08:30,612","00:08:34,780",- What do they call a Whopper ? - I don't know. I didn't go into Burger King.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:08:34,852","00:08:38,290",- You know what they put on French fries in Holland instead of ketchup ? - What ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:08:38,361","00:08:41,349",- Mayonnaise. - Goddamn !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:08:41,431","00:08:45,729","- I seen 'em do it, man. They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit. - Yuck."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:08:48,401","00:08:51,699",We should have shotguns for this kind of deal.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:08:54,670","00:08:57,439",- How many up there ? - Three or four.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:08:57,510","00:09:01,098",- That's countin' our guy ? - Not sure.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:09:01,179","00:09:04,577",- So that means that it could be up to five guys up there ? - It's possible.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:09:04,649","00:09:07,008",We should have fuckin' shotguns.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:09:07,080","00:09:09,749",- What's her name ? - Mia.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:09:09,819","00:09:14,017",- Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet ? - I don't know.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:09:14,089","00:09:17,687",However people meet people. She used to be a actress.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:09:17,758","00:09:20,247","Oh, really ? She do anything I'd have seen ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:09:20,329","00:09:24,767",- I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot. - Pilot ? What's a pilot ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:09:24,839","00:09:28,357","- Well, you know the shows on TV ? - I don't watch TV."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:09:28,439","00:09:32,067","Yeah, but you are aware that there is an invention called television,"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:09:32,138","00:09:35,236","- and on this invention they show shows, right ? - Yeah."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:09:35,308","00:09:39,716",The way they pick TV shows is they make one show. That show's called a pilot.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:09:39,777","00:09:42,716",Then they show that one show to the people who pick shows...
Pulp.Fiction,"00:09:42,788","00:09:45,717","and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they wanna make more shows."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:09:45,787","00:09:50,316","Some get chosen and become television programs. Some don't, become nothin'."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:09:50,387","00:09:53,585",She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:09:53,656","00:09:56,425",You remember Antwan Rockamora ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:09:56,496","00:10:00,324","Half-black, half-Samoan. Used to call him ""Tony Rocky Horror."""
Pulp.Fiction,"00:10:00,397","00:10:03,795","- Yeah, maybe. Fat, right ? - I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:10:03,867","00:10:06,706","I mean, he got a weight problem. What's a nigger gonna do ? He's Samoan."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:10:06,776","00:10:11,204",- I think I know who you mean. What about him ? - Marsellus fucked him up good.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:10:11,275","00:10:15,503",Word 'round the campfire is it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:10:23,655","00:10:27,683","- So what he'd do ? Fuck her ? - No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:10:27,755","00:10:31,453","- Well, then what then ? - He gave her a foot massage."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:10:33,694","00:10:35,963",A foot massage ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:10:36,035","00:10:38,094",- That's it ? - Mm-hmm.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:10:38,174","00:10:40,103",Then what'd Marsellus do ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:10:40,175","00:10:43,333",Sent a couple cats over to his place. They took him out on his patio.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:10:43,404","00:10:47,342",Threw his ass over the balcony. Nigger fell four stories.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:10:47,413","00:10:51,471","He had a little garden down at the bottom enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:10:51,553","00:10:53,812",Nigger fell through that.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:10:53,884","00:10:56,823","Since then, he kind of developed a speech impediment."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:10:58,294","00:11:01,023",- That's a damn shame. - Hmm.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:11:05,732","00:11:09,530","- But still, you play with matches, you get burned. - What do you mean ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:11:09,602","00:11:13,760",You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:11:13,832","00:11:16,301",You don't think he overreacted ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:11:16,373","00:11:21,242","Antwan didn't expect Marsellus to react the way he did, but he had to expect a reaction."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:11:21,312","00:11:25,470",It was a foot massage. A foot massage is nothin'. I give my mother a foot massage.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:11:25,551","00:11:29,069",It's laying your hands in a familiar way on Marsellus's new wife.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:11:29,152","00:11:34,051","I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy out ? No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:11:34,122","00:11:36,211","Whoa, stop right there. Eatin' the bitch out..."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:11:36,291","00:11:38,880",and givin' the bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fucking thing.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:11:38,961","00:11:42,899",- It's not. It's the same ballpark. - Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:11:42,961","00:11:45,900","Now, look, maybe your method of massage differs from mine."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:11:45,970","00:11:49,728",But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking your tongue in the holiest of holies...
Pulp.Fiction,"00:11:49,800","00:11:54,068",ain't the same fuckin' ballpark; it ain't the same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:11:54,140","00:11:58,008",- Foot massages don't mean shit ! - Have you ever given a foot massage ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:11:58,080","00:12:01,168",Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:12:01,249","00:12:03,908",- I'm the foot fuckin' master. - You given a lot of them ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:12:03,979","00:12:08,217","Shit, yeah ! Got my technique down and everything. I don't be ticklin' or nothin'."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:12:08,289","00:12:10,948",Would you give a guy a foot massage ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:12:12,359","00:12:15,058",- Fuck you.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:12:15,129","00:12:18,217",- You give 'em a lot ? - Fuck you.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:12:18,299","00:12:21,557","- You know, I'm kind of tired. I could use a foot massage. - Yo, yo, yo, man."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:12:21,638","00:12:24,826",You best back off. I'm gettin' a little pissed here.

Pulp.Fiction,"00:12:57,196","00:13:01,434","Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I kill the motherfucker."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:13:01,506","00:13:06,465","I ain't sayin' it's right, but you sayin' a massage don't mean nothin'. I'm sayin' it does."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:13:06,546","00:13:11,175","Now, look, I've given a million ladies a million foot massages, and they all meant somethin'."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:13:11,246","00:13:14,974","We act like they don't, but they do. That's what's so fuckin' cool about them."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:13:15,055","00:13:17,144",There's a sensuous thing goin' on...
Pulp.Fiction,"00:13:17,216","00:13:20,444","where you don't talk about it, but you know it and she knows it."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:13:20,526","00:13:25,585",Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan should've fuckin' better known better.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:13:25,665","00:13:30,063","That's his fuckin' wife, man. This ain't a man with a sense of humor about this shit."

Pulp.Fiction,"00:13:45,943","00:13:48,971",- Mia. - Why you so interested in big man's wife ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:13:49,053","00:13:54,282","He's goin' out of town, Florida. And he asked me if I'd take care of her while he's gone."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:13:54,353","00:13:58,311","- Take care of her ? - No, man. Just take her out."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:13:58,393","00:14:01,761",Show her a good time. Make sure she don't get lonely.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:14:01,833","00:14:04,352",You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:14:04,432","00:14:07,061",It is not a date.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:14:07,132","00:14:11,230",It's just like if you were gonna take your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:14:11,303","00:14:14,831","- It's just good company, that's all."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:14:18,842","00:14:23,611",- It's not a date. It's definitely not a date.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:14:29,951","00:14:33,809","Hey, kids. How you boys doin' ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:14:33,881","00:14:36,550","Hey, keep chillin'."

Pulp.Fiction,"00:15:26,099","00:15:28,398",What kind of hamburgers ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:15:28,468","00:15:30,197","- Uh, ch-cheeseburgers. - No, no, no."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:15:30,268","00:15:33,366","Where'd you get 'em ? McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:15:33,437","00:15:36,236","- Where ? - Uh, Big Kahuna Burger."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:15:36,307","00:15:39,435",Big Kahuna Burger ! That's that Hawaiian burger joint.

Pulp.Fiction,"00:16:10,946","00:16:14,374","- I ain't hungry. - Well, if you like burgers, give 'em a try sometime."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:16:14,446","00:16:18,274","Me, I can't usually get 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian,"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:16:18,345","00:16:21,473",which pretty much makes me a vegetarian.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:16:21,555","00:16:24,713",But I do love the taste of a good burger. Mmmm.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:16:24,785","00:16:29,314",You know what they call a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in France ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:16:29,394","00:16:31,453","- No. - Tell 'em, Vincent."

Pulp.Fiction,"00:16:43,304","00:16:46,602",Check out the big brain on Brett !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:16:46,673","00:16:50,011",You're a smart motherfucker. That's right. The metric system.

Pulp.Fiction,"00:17:00,493","00:17:03,352",Go right ahead.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:17:14,802","00:17:17,631",That hit the spot.

Pulp.Fiction,"00:38:58,869","00:39:01,638","And five, as in there's one-two-three-four-five of us."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:39:01,709","00:39:05,397","There was a blond one, Sommerset O'Neal. She was the leader."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:39:05,478","00:39:08,606",The Japanese fox was a kung fu master.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:39:08,679","00:39:12,737",The black girl was a demolition expert.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:39:12,819","00:39:15,688",French fox's speciality was sex.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:39:15,758","00:39:20,116",- What was your speciality ? - Knives.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:39:20,257","00:39:22,226","The character I played, Raven McCoy,"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:39:22,288","00:39:26,156",her background was she grew up raised by circus performers.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:39:26,228","00:39:30,496","According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:39:30,568","00:39:33,327",And she knew a zillion old jokes.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:39:33,397","00:39:37,525","Her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:39:37,606","00:39:40,904","And if we would have got picked up, they would've worked in a gimmick..."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:39:40,976","00:39:44,844",where every show I would've told another joke.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:39:46,047","00:39:48,806",You know any of them old jokes ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:39:48,887","00:39:52,615","Well, I only got the chance to say one 'cause we only did one show."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:39:52,686","00:39:55,245",- Tell me. - It's corny.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:39:56,155","00:39:58,244",Don't be that way. Tell me.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:39:58,325","00:40:02,023","- No, you wouldn't like it, and I'd be embarrassed. - You'd be embarr--"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:40:02,096","00:40:06,034","You told 50 million people, and you can't tell me ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:40:06,096","00:40:09,964","- I promise I won't laugh. - That's what I'm afraid of, Vince."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:40:10,035","00:40:12,364",That's not what I meant. You know it.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:40:12,435","00:40:15,873",Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you 'cause it's been built up too much.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:40:15,945","00:40:18,534",What a gyp.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:40:19,715","00:40:22,074",Martin and Lewis.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:40:25,154","00:40:27,553",Vanilla Coke.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:40:31,893","00:40:35,221",Mmm. Yummy.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:40:35,293","00:40:38,262",You think I could have a sip of that ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:40:39,794","00:40:41,963",Be my guest.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:40:42,034","00:40:46,062",I gotta know what a five-dollar shake tastes like.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:40:46,133","00:40:49,591","- You can use my straw. I don't have cooties. - Yeah, but maybe I do."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:40:49,672","00:40:52,541",Cooties I can handle.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:40:52,612","00:40:54,581",All right.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:41:01,652","00:41:04,451","Goddamn, that's a pretty fuckin' good milkshake !"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:41:04,522","00:41:08,580","-Told ya. -I don't know if it was worth $5, but it's pretty fuckin' good."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:41:43,519","00:41:47,047",- Don't you hate that ? - Hate what ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:41:47,129","00:41:49,458",Uncomfortable silences.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:41:51,469","00:41:55,988",Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:41:56,069","00:42:00,007",I don't know. That's a good question.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:42:00,069","00:42:04,808",That's when you know you found somebody really special.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:42:04,878","00:42:09,577",When you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably share silence.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:42:09,648","00:42:13,746","Well, I don't think we're quite there yet, but don't feel bad. We just met each other."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:42:15,258","00:42:18,376",I'll tell you what.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:42:18,457","00:42:21,715",I'm gonna go to the bathroom and powder my nose.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:42:21,797","00:42:24,985",You sit here... and think of something to say.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:42:26,228","00:42:28,167",I'll do that.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:42:30,497","00:42:32,436",Okay.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:42:57,695","00:42:59,884",I said goddamn !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:42:59,966","00:43:03,124",Goddamn ! Goddamn.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:43:05,735","00:43:08,324",I need some hair spray.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:43:14,175","00:43:16,164",Mmmm.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:43:16,244","00:43:20,572",Don't you just love it when you come back from the bathroom to find your food waiting for you ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:43:20,644","00:43:23,043",We're lucky we got anything at all.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:43:23,115","00:43:26,243",I don't think Buddy Holly's much of a waiter.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:43:26,324","00:43:29,452",Maybe we should've sat in Marilyn Monroe's section.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:43:29,523","00:43:32,581","- Which one ? There's two Monroes. - No, there's not."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:43:32,663","00:43:34,992",That is Marilyn Monroe.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:43:35,063","00:43:37,792",That is Mamie Van Doren.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:43:37,864","00:43:42,803","I don't see Jayne Mansfield, so she must have the night off."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:43:42,873","00:43:46,301",- Pretty smart. - Yeah. I got my moments.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:43:46,373","00:43:50,741","- So did you think of somethin' to say ? - Actually, I did."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:43:52,382","00:43:54,341",However...
Pulp.Fiction,"00:43:56,053","00:43:59,071","you seem like a really nice person, and l--"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:43:59,152","00:44:01,981",- I don't want to offend you. - Oooh.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:44:02,052","00:44:07,251","This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless, boring, gettin'-to-know-you chitchat."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:44:07,322","00:44:10,320",This sounds like you actually have somethin' to say.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:44:10,391","00:44:13,230","Well, well, I do. I do."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:44:13,302","00:44:17,360","-  But you have to promise not to be offended. - No, no."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:44:17,441","00:44:21,669",You can't promise somethin' like that. I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:44:21,741","00:44:26,610","You can ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to get offended."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:44:26,680","00:44:29,039","Then, through no fault of my own, I would have broken my promise."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:44:29,111","00:44:31,810",- Let's just forget it. - That's an impossibility.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:44:31,880","00:44:35,938",Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:44:36,020","00:44:38,219","- Is that a fact ? - And besides,"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:44:38,290","00:44:43,319","- isn't it more, uh, exciting when you don't have permission ? - All right, all right."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:44:43,390","00:44:46,189","Well, here goes."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:44:46,259","00:44:49,287",What did you think about what happened to Antwan ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:44:49,370","00:44:52,798",- Who's Antwan ? - Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:44:52,869","00:44:56,097",- He fell out of a window. - Hmm. Hmm.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:44:56,169","00:45:00,868","Well, that is one way to say it. Another way to say it would be that he was thrown out."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:45:00,949","00:45:04,107",Another way would be he was thrown out by Marsellus.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:45:04,178","00:45:09,307",Yet even another way is to say he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:45:09,389","00:45:11,818",- Is that a fact ? - No.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:45:11,888","00:45:15,016","No, it's not a fact. It's just what I heard. That's just what I heard."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:45:15,088","00:45:17,987",- Who told you ? - They.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:45:18,058","00:45:20,527","""They"" talk a lot, don't they ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:45:22,698","00:45:25,357",They certainly do. They certainly do.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:45:25,437","00:45:29,835","- Don't be shy, Vincent. What else did ""they"" say ? - I'm-- I'm not shy."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:45:29,907","00:45:32,426","- Um-- - Did it involve the ""F"" word ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:45:32,507","00:45:36,495","No, no, no, no, no. They just said that Antwan had given you a foot massage."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:45:38,046","00:45:40,675",- And ? - And-- And nothin'.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:45:40,747","00:45:43,616",That's it.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:45:43,686","00:45:45,745",You heard Marsellus...
Pulp.Fiction,"00:45:45,817","00:45:50,185",threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a fourth-story window for giving me a foot massage ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:45:50,256","00:45:52,195",- Mm-hmm. - And you believe that ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:45:52,255","00:45:56,784","Well, at the time I was told it sounded reasonable."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:45:56,865","00:45:59,953",Marsellus throwing Tony out of a fourth-story window...
Pulp.Fiction,"00:46:00,036","00:46:03,094",for massaging my feet seemed reasonable ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:46:03,166","00:46:06,624","No, it seemed excessive, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:46:06,705","00:46:09,364",I understand that Marsellus is very protective of you.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:46:09,445","00:46:14,074",A husband being protective of his wife is one thing.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:46:14,144","00:46:17,872",A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:46:17,955","00:46:20,544",But did it happen ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:46:20,615","00:46:26,454",Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand when he shook it... at my wedding.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:46:26,524","00:46:28,923",Really ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:46:28,993","00:46:32,321","Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus threw Tony out that window..."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:46:32,393","00:46:34,332",except Marsellus and Tony.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:46:34,404","00:46:38,392","When you little scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:46:38,534","00:46:42,402",Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment you've all been waiting for.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:46:42,473","00:46:47,502",The world-famous Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.

Pulp.Fiction,"00:46:58,852","00:47:02,410","Now, who will be our first contestants ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:47:02,492","00:47:04,751",- Right here ! -  All right !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:47:04,831","00:47:07,849","- I wanna dance. - No, no, no, no, no."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:47:07,931","00:47:12,660","No, no, no, no, no. I do believe Marsellus, my husband, your boss,"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:47:12,731","00:47:16,169",told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:47:16,241","00:47:19,929",Now I wanna dance; I wanna win; I want that trophy.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:47:20,011","00:47:21,220",- So dance good. - All right. You asked for it.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:47:21,221","00:47:22,550",- So dance good. - All right. You asked for it.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:47:22,620","00:47:25,589",Let's hear it for our first contestants.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:47:30,191","00:47:35,460","Now let's meet our first contestants here this evening. Young lady, what is your name ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:47:35,530","00:47:37,519",Mrs. Mia Wallace.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:47:37,600","00:47:40,229",And how 'bout your fella here ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:47:40,299","00:47:42,128",Vincent Vega.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:47:42,199","00:47:45,637","All right, let's see what you can do. Take it away !"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:47:45,710","00:47:48,639",-  Go for it. -  Come on !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:48:06,928","00:48:10,886",It was a teenage wedding and the old folks wished them well
Pulp.Fiction,"00:48:12,898","00:48:16,856",You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle
Pulp.Fiction,"00:48:18,937","00:48:23,035",And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell
Pulp.Fiction,"00:48:25,007","00:48:29,305",C'est la vie say the old folks It goes to show you never can tell
Pulp.Fiction,"00:48:31,187","00:48:35,345",They furnished off an apartment with a two-room Roebucks sale
Pulp.Fiction,"00:48:37,256","00:48:41,524",The 'coolerador was crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale
Pulp.Fiction,"00:48:43,397","00:48:47,295",But when Pierre found work the little money comin' worked out well
Pulp.Fiction,"00:48:49,396","00:48:53,664",C'est la vie say the old folks It goes to show you never can tell
Pulp.Fiction,"00:48:55,375","00:48:59,743",They had a hi-fi phono and boy did they let it blast
Pulp.Fiction,"00:49:01,776","00:49:06,044","Seven hundred little records all rock, rhythm and jazz"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:49:07,785","00:49:11,883",But when the sun went down the rapid tempo of the music fell
Pulp.Fiction,"00:49:13,824","00:49:18,853",C'est la vie say the old folks It goes to show you never can tell
Pulp.Fiction,"00:49:44,352","00:49:48,580",They had a teenage wedding and the old folks wished them well

Pulp.Fiction,"00:50:29,800","00:50:32,988",Is that what you call an uncomfortable silence ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:50:33,070","00:50:36,428",I don't know what you call that.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:50:36,500","00:50:39,129",- Drinks ! Music !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:50:40,140","00:50:42,369",I'm gonna take a piss.

Pulp.Fiction,"00:52:29,303","00:52:32,571",Whether or not you can maintain loyalty.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:52:32,644","00:52:35,942",Because... being loyal is very important.

Pulp.Fiction,"00:55:53,052","00:55:54,981","Yeah, I told them."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:55:55,052","00:55:58,310",And that is exactly what I'm going to tell this fucking asshole right now.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:55:59,891","00:56:02,720",-Don't you dare strike me ! - Hello.

Pulp.Fiction,"00:56:12,301","00:56:15,559","- I got this chick, she's fuckin' O.D.in' on me ! - Well, don't bring her here !"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:56:15,641","00:56:19,969",I'm not even joking with you ! Do not be bringing some fucked-up pooh-bah to my house !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:56:20,040","00:56:22,099",- No choice. - Wh-- She's O.D.in' ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:56:22,180","00:56:25,368","- She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man ! -  Just dandy."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:56:25,451","00:56:29,639","Okay, then you bite the fuckin' bullet, take her to a hospital and call a lawyer."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:56:29,720","00:56:32,149","- Negative ! - This is not my fuckin' problem, man !"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:56:32,220","00:56:35,948","You fucked her up, you fuckin' deal with this !"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:56:36,020","00:56:38,859","Uh, are you talkin' to me on a cellular phone ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:56:38,929","00:56:41,358",I don't know you. Who is this ? Don't come here !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:56:41,430","00:56:44,758",I'm hanging up the phone ! Prank caller ! Prank caller !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:56:52,838","00:56:55,777",- What the hell was that ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:56:57,738","00:57:00,177",Have you lost your fucking mind ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:57:00,249","00:57:03,178","- You were talking about drug shit on a cellular phone ! - Lance, help me."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:57:03,249","00:57:06,188",- You crashed your car into my fucking house ! - Grab her feet.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:57:06,248","00:57:09,686",Are you deaf ? You are not bringing this fucked-up bitch into my house !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:57:09,758","00:57:12,687","This ""fucked-up bitch"" is Marsellus Wallace's wife."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:57:12,758","00:57:15,187",- Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is ? - Yeah.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:57:15,257","00:57:18,196","If she croaks on me, I am a fucking grease spot !"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:57:18,268","00:57:22,857",I will be forced to tell him that you did not help and let her die on your lawn.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:57:22,937","00:57:25,866","Now, come on. Help me, help me. Pick her up."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:57:26,937","00:57:28,866",- Shit.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:57:30,937","00:57:33,306",Lance !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:57:33,376","00:57:35,305",Shit.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:57:35,377","00:57:37,816",It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:57:37,886","00:57:41,214",What the fuck's going on out here ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:57:41,286","00:57:43,215",Who's she ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:57:43,286","00:57:46,225",Go to the fridge and get the thing with the adrenalin shot.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:57:46,285","00:57:48,344",- What's wrong with her ? - She's O.D.ing !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:57:48,426","00:57:50,485",- Get her outta here ! -  Get the shot !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:57:50,555","00:57:54,083",- Fuck you ! Fuck you too ! - What a fuckin' bitch.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:57:54,166","00:57:56,095","Just keep talking to her, all right ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:57:56,165","00:57:59,094",She's gettin' the shot. I'm going to go get my little black medical book.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:57:59,165","00:58:01,154",What the fuck you need a medical book for ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:58:01,235","00:58:03,174",I've never had to give an adrenalin shot before !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:58:03,235","00:58:06,673",I don't go joy-poppin' with bubble-gummers ! My friends can handle their highs !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:58:06,744","00:58:09,173","- Get the shot ! - I am, if you'll let me !"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:58:09,244","00:58:12,173",- I ain't stopping you ! - Stop talking to me. Start talking to her !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:58:12,245","00:58:14,184",- Get the shot ! - All right !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:58:17,354","00:58:20,782",-Hurry up. We're losing her ! - I'm looking as fast as I can !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:58:20,854","00:58:22,793",What's he looking for ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:58:22,853","00:58:25,792",- I don't know. Some book. - What are you looking for ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:58:25,863","00:58:28,792",- A little black medical book. - What are you looking for ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:58:28,864","00:58:32,962",My little black medical book ! It's like a textbook they give to nurses.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:58:33,034","00:58:35,973",- I never saw no medical book. - Trust me. I have one.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:58:36,033","00:58:38,972","- If it's so important, why don't you keep it with the shot ? - I don't know !"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:58:39,043","00:58:42,971","- Stop bothering me ! - While you're looking, that girl's gonna die on our carpet."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:58:43,042","00:58:44,971",You're never gonna find anything in this mess !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:58:45,042","00:58:48,940","- I'm gonna fucking kill you if you don't shut up ! - Lance, get in here !"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:58:49,012","00:58:53,240",- Right ? Pig. - Get the fuck outta my way.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:58:53,322","00:58:56,750","- Quit fuckin' around and give her the shot. - While I'm doing this,"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:58:56,822","00:59:00,150",you take off her shirt and find her heart.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:59:00,221","00:59:03,779","- Does it gotta be exact ? - We're giving her a shot in the heart, so it's gotta be exact."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:59:03,862","00:59:06,801",I don't know exactly where her heart is. I think it's right here.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:59:06,861","00:59:10,529","- That's it. - All right, what I need is a big, fat magic marker."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:59:10,601","00:59:12,530",- You got it ? - What ?
Pulp.Fiction,"00:59:12,601","00:59:15,300",A magic marker. A felt pen !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:59:15,370","00:59:17,999",A fuckin' black magic marker ! Christ.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:59:18,080","00:59:23,139","- Come on, man. Hurry up ! - Fuck ! Okay, okay. Okay. I think it's ready."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:59:26,321","00:59:28,810","- Hurry up, man. - I'll tell you what to do."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:59:28,890","00:59:31,819","- You're gonna give her the shot. - No, you're gonna give her the shot."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:59:31,890","00:59:34,819",- I ain't giving her the shot. I never done this before. - I never done this either !
Pulp.Fiction,"00:59:34,890","00:59:37,878",I ain't starting now ! You brought her here. You give her the shot.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:59:37,959","00:59:41,357","The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch to your house, then I give her the shot."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:59:41,430","00:59:43,369",Give it to me. Give me that.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:59:43,430","00:59:46,369","All right, tell me what to do."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:59:46,439","00:59:49,427","Okay, you're giving her an injection of adrenalin straight to her heart."
Pulp.Fiction,"00:59:49,509","00:59:52,438",- But she's got a breastplate-- You gotta pierce through that.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:59:52,509","00:59:55,438",You gotta bring the needle down in a stabbing motion.
Pulp.Fiction,"00:59:55,508","00:59:58,946","- I gotta-- I gotta stab her three times ? - No, just stab her once !"
Pulp.Fiction,"00:59:59,019","01:00:02,447",But it's gotta be hard enough to get through her breastplate into her heart.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:00:02,519","01:00:05,448","Once you do that, you p-press down on the p-plunger."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:00:05,518","01:00:08,007",- Okay. Then what happens ? - Kinda curious about that myself.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:00:08,088","01:00:11,027",This ain't no fuckin' joke ! Am I gonna kill her ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:00:11,088","01:00:14,526","- She's supposed to come out of it like that. It's-- - All right, count to three."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:00:14,598","01:00:16,787",- All right. Ready ? - One.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:00:22,067","01:00:23,596",Two.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:00:31,576","01:00:33,545",Three !
Pulp.Fiction,"01:00:48,125","01:00:51,393","If you're all right, then say something."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:00:51,466","01:00:54,484",Something.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:00:54,565","01:00:56,504",That was fuckin' trippy.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:00:59,075","01:01:02,403","- Ohh. - Oh, man."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:01:27,094","01:01:29,033",Mia. Mia.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:01:31,204","01:01:33,633",What's--
Pulp.Fiction,"01:01:33,703","01:01:36,502",What's your thoughts on-- on--
Pulp.Fiction,"01:01:36,573","01:01:38,602",on how to handle this ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:01:38,672","01:01:40,611",What's yours ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:01:43,682","01:01:47,580","Well, I'm of the opinion that if Marsellus lived his whole life,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:01:47,652","01:01:51,650",he doesn't need to know nothing about this incident.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:01:51,782","01:01:54,581","If Marsellus knew about this incident,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:01:54,652","01:01:56,711",I'd be in as much trouble as you.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:01:56,781","01:01:59,280",I seriously doubt that.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:01:59,351","01:02:02,290",I can keep a secret if you can.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:02:04,332","01:02:06,261",Shake on it ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:02:11,471","01:02:13,760",Mum's the word ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:02:13,830","01:02:15,769",Cool.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:02:15,841","01:02:20,169","Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go home and have a heart attack."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:02:22,910","01:02:24,839",Vincent.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:02:26,710","01:02:29,738",Do you wanna hear my Fox Force Five joke ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:02:30,820","01:02:32,749",Sure.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:02:32,820","01:02:35,848",Except I think I'm still a little too petrified to laugh.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:02:35,919","01:02:38,858","No, you won't laugh 'cause it's not funny."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:02:38,930","01:02:42,258","But if you still wanna hear it, I'll tell it."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:02:42,330","01:02:44,519",- I can't wait. - Okay.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:02:44,599","01:02:47,468",Three tomatoes are walkin' down the street.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:02:47,529","01:02:49,968","Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato and Baby Tomato."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:02:50,038","01:02:54,196","Baby Tomato starts lagging behind, and Papa Tomato gets really angry."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:02:54,268","01:02:57,207","Goes back and squishes him and says,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:02:57,279","01:02:59,368","""Ketchup."""
Pulp.Fiction,"01:03:02,218","01:03:04,147",Ketchup.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:03:08,287","01:03:10,416",See you around.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:03:31,477","01:03:35,175","Oh, that Paddlefoot. He funny, silly dog."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:03:35,247","01:03:38,176",He think totem pole alive !
Pulp.Fiction,"01:03:38,246","01:03:40,975",He arctic tenderfoot !
Pulp.Fiction,"01:03:41,046","01:03:44,714",That totem pole been here forever !
Pulp.Fiction,"01:03:44,786","01:03:46,725",- Butch ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:03:46,785","01:03:49,654","One more thing, and we'll start for--"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:03:49,726","01:03:52,665","- Butch, stop watching TV for a second. - Yeah ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:03:52,725","01:03:56,353",- You've got a special visitor. - Stand up. Stand up.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:03:59,135","01:04:04,074","Now, do you remember when I told you your daddy died in a P.O.W. camp ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:04:04,134","01:04:07,872","Well, this here is Captain Koons."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:04:07,945","01:04:10,874",He was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:04:16,214","01:04:18,153","Hello, little man."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:04:18,224","01:04:22,312","Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:04:22,393","01:04:25,621","See, I was a good friend of your dad's."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:04:25,694","01:04:28,722",We were in that Hanoi pit of hell together...
Pulp.Fiction,"01:04:28,794","01:04:31,263",over five years.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:04:31,333","01:04:33,262",Hopefully...
Pulp.Fiction,"01:04:33,333","01:04:36,272","you'll never have to experience this yourself,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:04:36,332","01:04:39,770",but when two men are in a situation like me and your dad were...
Pulp.Fiction,"01:04:39,842","01:04:42,641","for as long as we were,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:04:42,713","01:04:47,011",you take on certain responsibilities of the other.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:04:47,083","01:04:49,012",If it'd been me who'd--
Pulp.Fiction,"01:04:50,352","01:04:52,281","not made it,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:04:52,352","01:04:56,620",Major Coolidge'd be talking right now to my son Jim.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:04:56,692","01:05:00,350","But the way it turned out, I'm talking to you."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:05:01,762","01:05:03,691",Butch...
Pulp.Fiction,"01:05:05,232","01:05:07,161",I got something for ya.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:05:13,671","01:05:15,730",This watch I got here...
Pulp.Fiction,"01:05:15,810","01:05:20,609",was first purchased by your great-grandfather during the first World War.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:05:20,681","01:05:25,340","It was bought in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:05:25,420","01:05:28,978",Made by the first company to ever make wristwatches.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:05:29,050","01:05:31,989","Up 'til then, people just carried pocket watches."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:05:32,060","01:05:35,218",It was bought by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...
Pulp.Fiction,"01:05:35,289","01:05:38,228",on the day he set sail for Paris.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:05:38,300","01:05:40,729","This was your great-grandfather's war watch,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:05:40,800","01:05:44,158","and he wore it every day he was in that war, and..."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:05:44,229","01:05:47,797","when he'd done his duty, he went home to your great-grandmother,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:05:47,868","01:05:52,306","took the watch off, put it in an old coffee can, and in that can it stayed..."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:05:52,378","01:05:56,806","until your granddad, Dane Coolidge, was called upon by his country..."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:05:56,878","01:06:00,606",to go overseas and fight the Germans once again.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:06:00,678","01:06:04,136",This time they called it World War ll.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:06:04,218","01:06:09,217",Your great-grandfather gave this watch to your granddad for good luck.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:06:09,287","01:06:12,285","Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:06:12,358","01:06:15,297","Dane was a Marine, and he was killed..."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:06:15,367","01:06:19,385",along with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake lsland.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:06:19,467","01:06:22,396",Your granddad was facing death.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:06:22,467","01:06:24,406",He knew it.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:06:24,466","01:06:28,404","None of those boys ever had any illusions about leaving that island alive,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:06:28,476","01:06:31,674","so three days before the Japanese took the island,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:06:31,747","01:06:36,976","your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport, name of Winocki--"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:06:37,046","01:06:39,985",a man he'd never met before in his life--
Pulp.Fiction,"01:06:40,056","01:06:43,025","to deliver to his infant son,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:06:43,086","01:06:47,685","who he'd never seen in the flesh, his gold watch."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:06:47,756","01:06:52,094","Three days later, your granddad was dead, but Winocki kept his word."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:06:52,166","01:06:56,434","After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:06:56,505","01:07:00,733",delivering to your infant father his dad's gold watch.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:07:00,805","01:07:02,744",This watch.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:07:08,614","01:07:14,053",This watch was on your daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:07:14,114","01:07:17,552","He was captured, put in a Vietnamese prison camp."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:07:17,623","01:07:21,681","He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:07:21,763","01:07:25,281","it'd be confiscated, taken away."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:07:25,364","01:07:29,062","The way your dad looked at it, this watch was your birthright."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:07:29,133","01:07:33,071","He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:07:33,133","01:07:37,071",so he hid it in one place he knew he could hide something-- his ass.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:07:37,143","01:07:40,571",Five long years he wore this watch up his ass.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:07:40,643","01:07:44,841",Then he died of dysentery-- He give me the watch.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:07:44,912","01:07:48,780",I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass two years.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:07:48,852","01:07:50,781",Then...
Pulp.Fiction,"01:07:50,852","01:07:54,910","after seven years, I was sent home to my family and..."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:07:54,992","01:07:56,921",now...
Pulp.Fiction,"01:07:59,362","01:08:02,291","Iittle man, I give the watch to you."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:08:25,150","01:08:27,089","It's time, Butch."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:08:34,830","01:08:37,759","ln the heavyweight division,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:08:37,829","01:08:40,987","- in the right corner wearing the blue trunks,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:08:41,069","01:08:44,327","weighing 210 pounds,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:08:44,399","01:08:47,527",Floyd Ray Wilson !
Pulp.Fiction,"01:08:50,608","01:08:52,537",It's official. It's official.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:08:52,609","01:08:55,548","- Wilson is dead ! - Well, Dan, that had to be the bloodiest,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:08:55,618","01:08:58,047","hands down, the most brutal fight this city's ever seen."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:08:58,118","01:09:01,706",Coolidge was out of there faster than I've ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:09:01,788","01:09:04,717",- Do you think he knew Wilson was dead ? - My guess would be yes.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:09:04,787","01:09:08,225",I could see the frenzy in his eyes give way to the realization of what he was doing.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:09:08,297","01:09:11,725",- I think any man would've left the ring that fast. - Do you feel this tragedy...
Pulp.Fiction,"01:09:11,798","01:09:13,727",is gonna affect the world of boxing ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:09:13,797","01:09:17,735",A tragedy like this can't help but shake the world of boxing to its very foundations.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:09:17,797","01:09:21,735","It's of paramount importance, during the sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the W.B.A. remain--"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:09:56,575","01:09:58,904","Man, you know I didn't--"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:09:58,975","01:10:01,904","- Marsellus. - No, it wasn't. I didn't do it."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:10:01,974","01:10:03,913",I didn't do it.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:10:03,975","01:10:06,474",- How you doing ? - Great.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:10:06,544","01:10:08,983",I never thanked you for dinner.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:10:10,884","01:10:12,823",- What you got ? - He booked.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:10:12,884","01:10:15,982",- His trainer ? - Says he don't know nothin'. I believe him.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:10:16,053","01:10:19,491","- I think Butch surprised his ass same as us. - No, we don't wanna ""think."""
Pulp.Fiction,"01:10:19,563","01:10:23,151","We wanna know. Take him to the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:10:23,234","01:10:26,662",We'll find out for goddamn sure what he knows and what he don't.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:10:26,734","01:10:28,663",Butch's search-- How do you want it done ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:10:28,733","01:10:31,672",I'm prepared to scour the Earth for that motherfucker.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:10:31,743","01:10:35,171","If Butch goes to lndochina, I want a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice..."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:10:35,243","01:10:37,372",ready to pop a cap in his ass.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:10:37,442","01:10:39,581",I will take care of it.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:10:49,322","01:10:51,691",Mister.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:10:54,591","01:10:57,080","- Hey, mister. - What ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:10:57,162","01:11:01,961","You were in that fight, the fight on the radio."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:11:02,032","01:11:05,470",- You're the fighter ? - Whatever gave you that idea ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:11:05,541","01:11:08,300","No, come on."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:11:08,371","01:11:10,310",You're him.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:11:10,381","01:11:12,810",I know you're him.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:11:14,550","01:11:16,449",Tell me you're him.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:11:16,511","01:11:18,450",I'm him.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:11:19,551","01:11:21,980",You killed the other boxing man.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:11:25,620","01:11:27,719",He's dead ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:11:27,789","01:11:30,228",The radio said he was dead.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:11:33,000","01:11:35,229","Sorry about that, Floyd."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:11:36,529","01:11:39,028",What does it feel like ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:11:39,099","01:11:41,038",What does what feel like ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:11:41,109","01:11:43,038",Killing a man.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:11:44,808","01:11:48,866",Beating another man to death with your bare hands.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:11:48,948","01:11:50,877","What are you, a weirdo ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:11:50,949","01:11:52,878",No.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:11:52,949","01:11:56,387",It is a subject I have much interest in.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:11:57,958","01:12:01,886",You are the first person I have ever met who has killed somebody.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:12:04,398","01:12:06,827",So ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:12:06,897","01:12:10,155",- What does it feel like to kill a man ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:12:11,267","01:12:13,196",I'll tell you what.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:12:13,268","01:12:17,206","Give me one of them cigarettes you got up there, and I'll tell you all about it."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:12:34,926","01:12:38,154","So, Esmarelda..."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:12:39,456","01:12:42,864",Villa Lobos-- Is that Mexican ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:12:42,925","01:12:46,163","The name is Spanish, but I am Colombian."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:12:46,236","01:12:49,534","- That's some handle you got there, honey. - Thank you."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:12:49,606","01:12:51,535",And what is your name ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:12:51,605","01:12:53,294",Butch.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:12:53,375","01:12:55,844",Butch.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:12:55,904","01:13:00,673","- What does it mean ? - I'm an American, honey. Our names don't mean shit."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:13:00,744","01:13:03,403","So, moving right along,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:13:03,485","01:13:05,414","Esmarelda,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:13:05,484","01:13:07,743",what is it you want to know ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:13:07,824","01:13:12,683",- I want to know what it feels like to kill a man. - I couldn't tell ya.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:13:18,593","01:13:23,031",Didn't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:13:23,103","01:13:27,692","Now that I know he's dead, you wanna know how I feel about it ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:13:31,442","01:13:34,880",I don't feel the least bit bad about it.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:13:45,852","01:13:48,291",What the fuck'd I tell ya ? Huh ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:13:48,362","01:13:52,290","As soon as the word got out the fix was in, man, the odds went through the roof."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:13:52,361","01:13:54,560",I know. I know. Unbelievable.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:13:54,631","01:13:58,069","Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was a better boxer, he'd still be alive."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:13:58,132","01:14:00,071","If he never laced up his gloves,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:14:00,132","01:14:02,571","which he never shoulda done in the first fuckin' place, he'd still be alive."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:14:04,641","01:14:08,229","Yeah, well, who gives a fuck ? It's over now."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:14:08,310","01:14:11,239","Yeah, well, enough about the poor, unfortunate Mr. Floyd."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:14:11,310","01:14:15,008",Let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr. Butch.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:14:15,081","01:14:18,020",How many bookies did you lay it around on ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:14:18,091","01:14:20,520",All eight ? How long to collect ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:14:22,160","01:14:25,089","So you'll have it all by tomorrow night ? No, I understand."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:14:25,159","01:14:28,317","A few stragglers aside. Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:14:28,399","01:14:30,628","That is great news, man."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:14:30,699","01:14:34,897","Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and Fabienne are gonna leave in the morning."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:14:34,969","01:14:38,227",It'll probably take us a couple days to get down to Knoxville.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:14:38,309","01:14:40,238","Okay, my brother."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:14:40,309","01:14:42,278",You're right.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:14:42,339","01:14:44,678",You're goddamn right.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:14:44,749","01:14:48,237","All right, Scotty, next time I see you, it'll be on Tennessee time."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:14:48,318","01:14:50,647","Cool, brother."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:15:05,797","01:15:08,226",$45.60.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:15:11,808","01:15:13,737","And, uh,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:15:13,807","01:15:17,105",here's a little something for the effort.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:15:17,177","01:15:21,105","Now, if anybody asks you who your fare was tonight, what are you gonna say ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:15:21,177","01:15:23,116",The truth.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:15:23,176","01:15:26,674","Three well-dressed, slightly toasted Mexicans."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:15:28,586","01:15:30,985","Bonsoir, Esmarelda Villa Lobos."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:15:31,056","01:15:33,575","Buenas Noches, Butch."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:15:44,706","01:15:46,635",Whew.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:15:48,006","01:15:49,995",Keep the light off.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:15:50,075","01:15:53,004","- Is that better, Sugar Pop ? - Oui."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:15:57,484","01:15:59,413",Hard day at the office ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:15:59,484","01:16:01,413",Pretty hard.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:16:01,485","01:16:03,714",Got in a fight.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:16:03,784","01:16:05,943",Poor baby.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:16:06,025","01:16:08,584",Can you make spoons ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:16:08,654","01:16:11,593",You know what ? I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:16:11,664","01:16:15,592",- I'm stinkin' like a dog over here. - I like the way you stink.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:16:15,663","01:16:18,092",Let me take this jacket off.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:16:20,264","01:16:23,792",- I was looking at myself in the mirror. - Uh-huh.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:16:23,874","01:16:25,803",I wish I had a pot.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:16:27,573","01:16:31,511","You were looking at yourself in the mirror, and you wish you had some pot ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:16:31,583","01:16:34,512",A pot. A pot belly.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:16:34,582","01:16:36,741",Pot bellies are sexy.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:16:36,813","01:16:39,112","Well, you should be happy,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:16:39,182","01:16:41,121",'cause you have one.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:16:41,193","01:16:44,641","Shut up, fatso. I don't have a pot."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:16:44,722","01:16:48,590","I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did ""Lucky Star."""
Pulp.Fiction,"01:16:48,661","01:16:50,590",It's not the same thing.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:16:50,661","01:16:54,599",I didn't know there was such a difference between a pot belly and a tummy.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:16:54,672","01:16:56,601",The difference is huge.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:16:56,671","01:17:00,099",Would you like it if I had a pot belly ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:17:00,171","01:17:02,110",No.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:17:02,171","01:17:06,609",Pot bellies make a man look either oafish or like a gorilla.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:17:06,680","01:17:09,768",But on a woman a pot belly's very sexy.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:17:09,850","01:17:15,289","The rest of you is normal-- normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass--"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:17:15,350","01:17:19,408","but with a big, perfectly round pot belly."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:17:19,490","01:17:22,429","If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt two sizes too small..."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:17:22,490","01:17:24,429",to accentuate it.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:17:24,499","01:17:26,928",You think men would find that attractive ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:17:26,999","01:17:30,157",I don't give a damn what men find attractive.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:17:30,230","01:17:33,688",It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye...
Pulp.Fiction,"01:17:33,770","01:17:35,709",is seldom the same.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:17:39,109","01:17:42,707","If you had a pot belly, I would punch you in it."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:17:42,779","01:17:45,718",- You'd punch me in the belly ? - Right in the belly.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:17:45,778","01:17:47,717",Ohh ! I'd smother you !
Pulp.Fiction,"01:17:47,789","01:17:51,717",- I'd drop it right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe !
Pulp.Fiction,"01:17:51,789","01:17:53,718",- You'd do that ? - Yeah.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:17:53,788","01:17:55,757",- Promise ? - Yeah.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:17:59,257","01:18:01,196",- Mmm. - Mmm.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:18:03,427","01:18:05,866",Oh.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:18:09,307","01:18:11,236",Did you get everything ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:18:11,307","01:18:14,295","- Yes, I did. - Good job, Sugar Pop."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:18:14,377","01:18:16,306",Did everything go as planned ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:18:16,377","01:18:19,106",- You didn't listen to the-- Ow !
Pulp.Fiction,"01:18:19,177","01:18:21,116",You didn't listen to the radio ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:18:21,186","01:18:24,474",I never listen to your fights. Were you the winner ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:18:24,557","01:18:26,846","I won, all right."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:18:26,916","01:18:29,885",- Are you still retiring ? - Sure am.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:18:29,956","01:18:32,325",So it all worked out in the finish.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:18:33,756","01:18:37,194","We're not at the finish yet, baby."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:18:45,136","01:18:48,005","We're in a lot of danger, aren't we ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:18:49,575","01:18:52,514","If they find us, they'll kill us, won't they ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:18:54,585","01:18:57,514","But they won't find us, will they ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:19:00,415","01:19:03,354",Do you still want me to go with you ?

Pulp.Fiction,"01:56:11,630","01:56:13,559",I didn't mean it. It was an accident.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:56:13,630","01:56:16,569","- Man, I seen some crazy-ass shit in my time, but this-- - Chill out, man !"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:56:16,629","01:56:19,568",It was an accident. We probably went over a bump or somethin'.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:56:19,639","01:56:21,568",The car ain't hit no motherfuckin' bump.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:56:21,638","01:56:24,966",I didn't mean to shoot the son of a bitch. The gun went off.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:56:25,038","01:56:28,476",Look at this fuckin' mess ! We're on a city street in broad daylight here !
Pulp.Fiction,"01:56:28,549","01:56:31,478","- I don't believe it ! - Well, believe it now, motherfucker !"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:56:31,549","01:56:35,007",We gotta get this car off the road. Cops notice shit like a car drenched in blood.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:56:34,588","01:56:37,517","- Just take it to a friendly place, that's all ! - This is the Valley, Vincent."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:56:37,588","01:56:40,017",Marsellus ain't got no friendly places in the Valley.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:56:40,088","01:56:43,027","- Well, Jules, this ain't my fuckin' town, man ! - Shit !"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:56:43,097","01:56:46,026",- What you doing ? - I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:56:46,098","01:56:49,626","-Where's Toluca Lake ? -Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:56:49,698","01:56:52,637","If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't know what the fuck we gonna do,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:56:52,697","01:56:55,636",'cause I ain't got no other partners in 818.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:56:55,707","01:56:58,636","Jimmie, how you doin', man ? It's Jules. Just listen up, man."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:56:58,707","01:57:02,645","Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we gotta get it off the road, pronto."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:57:02,707","01:57:04,906",I need to use your garage for a couple hours.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:57:06,917","01:57:09,846",We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie situation.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:57:09,916","01:57:13,544",He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:57:13,626","01:57:16,555","- If he does, what do we do ? - We ain't leavin' 'til we make a couple calls,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:57:16,626","01:57:19,555",but I don't want it to reach that pitch-- Jimmie's a friend.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:57:19,625","01:57:22,564",You don't come into your friend's house and start tellin' him what's what.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:57:22,626","01:57:24,565",Just tell him not to be abusive.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:57:24,636","01:57:26,565",He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:57:26,635","01:57:29,793","Put yourself in his position-- It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:57:29,865","01:57:31,804",He wasn't expectin' this shit.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:57:31,875","01:57:34,804",We gotta remember here who's doin' who a favor.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:57:34,875","01:57:38,813","If that favor means I gotta take shit, he can stick that favor straight up his ass."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:57:39,175","01:57:43,113","- Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd you just do to his towel, man ? - I was dryin' my hands !"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:57:43,185","01:57:46,114",- You're supposed to wash 'em first ! - You watched me wash 'em.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:57:46,184","01:57:49,742",- I watched you get 'em wet. - I was washin' 'em. This shit's hard to get off.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:57:49,823","01:57:51,752",Maybe if he'd had Lava I coulda done a better job.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:57:51,824","01:57:53,753","I used the same fuckin' soap you did,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:57:53,823","01:57:56,762","and when I finished, the towel didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad !"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:57:56,824","01:57:59,763",What if he was to come in here and see his towel like this ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:57:59,833","01:58:03,921","It's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a head, man !"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:58:04,003","01:58:07,431","Look, I ain't threatenin' you or nothin', all right ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:58:07,503","01:58:11,961","You know I respect you and all. But just don't put me in this position, all right ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:58:12,042","01:58:14,741",All right. Fine. Fine.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:58:14,813","01:58:17,742","Ask me nice like that, no problem."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:58:17,812","01:58:20,751",Just go handle your friend. Go ahead. I don't care.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:58:22,482","01:58:25,351","Mmm ! Goddamn, Jimmie !"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:58:25,422","01:58:27,511",This some serious gourmet shit.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:58:27,592","01:58:29,521",Me and Vincent would've been satisfied...
Pulp.Fiction,"01:58:29,591","01:58:31,560",with some freeze-dried Taster's Choice.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:58:31,632","01:58:33,561",Right ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:58:33,632","01:58:36,561",And he springs this serious gourmet shit on us.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:58:36,632","01:58:38,691","- What flavor is this ? - Knock it off, Julie."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:58:38,771","01:58:42,789",- What ? - I don't need you to tell me how fuckin' good my coffee is.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:58:42,871","01:58:45,360",I'm the one who buys it. I know how good it is.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:58:45,441","01:58:47,370","When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:58:47,440","01:58:51,068","I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:58:51,151","01:58:55,079",But you know what's on my mind right now ? It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:58:55,151","01:58:57,310",It's the dead nigger in my garage.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:58:57,390","01:59:00,818","- Jimmie, don't even worry-- - Don't tell me about anything. I wanna ask you a question."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:59:00,890","01:59:02,819","When you came pulling in here,"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:59:02,890","01:59:06,088","did you notice the sign on the front of my house that said, ""Dead Nigger Storage"" ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:59:06,159","01:59:09,597",- You know I ain't seen no-- - Did you notice the sign on the front of my house...
Pulp.Fiction,"01:59:09,660","01:59:11,599","that said, ""Dead Nigger Storage"" ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:59:11,670","01:59:14,399",No. I didn't.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:59:14,469","01:59:17,398",- You know why you didn't see that sign ? - Why ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:59:17,469","01:59:21,998","'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why !"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:59:22,078","01:59:25,007",- We're not gonna store the motherfucker-- - Don't you fuckin' realize...
Pulp.Fiction,"01:59:25,079","01:59:29,517","that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"01:59:29,579","01:59:32,817",No marriage counselor. No trial separation. I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.
Pulp.Fiction,"01:59:32,888","01:59:36,246",Okay ? And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced !
Pulp.Fiction,"01:59:36,318","01:59:41,317","Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you, but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:59:41,397","01:59:43,486","Jimmie, Jimmie, she ain't gonna leave you."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:59:43,558","01:59:47,496","Don't fuckin' ""Jimmie"" me, Jules ! Okay ? Don't fuckin' ""Jimmie"" me."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:59:47,568","01:59:51,526",There's nothin' you're gonna say that's gonna make me forget I love my wife. Is there ?
Pulp.Fiction,"01:59:54,677","01:59:59,336","Now, look, you know, she comes home from work in about an hour and a half."
Pulp.Fiction,"01:59:59,406","02:00:02,464",The graveyard shift at the hospital.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:00:02,547","02:00:05,605",You gotta make some phone calls ? You gotta call some people ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:00:05,687","02:00:09,615","Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck out of my house before she gets here."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:00:09,686","02:00:12,625",That's Kool and the Gang. We don't wanna fuck your shit up.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:00:12,685","02:00:15,654",All I wanna do is call my people and get 'em to bring us in.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:00:15,725","02:00:18,664",You're fucking my shit up right now !
Pulp.Fiction,"02:00:18,726","02:00:21,824",You're gonna fuck my shit up big time if Bonnie comes home.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:00:21,895","02:00:25,393","Do me that favor, all right ? The phone is in my bedroom. I suggest you get going."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:00:25,465","02:00:28,404","Well, say she comes home."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:00:28,475","02:00:30,904",What do you think she'll do ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:00:32,405","02:00:34,844","Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:00:34,914","02:00:37,103",That ain't no kinda answer.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:00:37,175","02:00:40,233","I mean, you know, I don't. How much ? A lot or a little ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:00:40,314","02:00:43,183",You got to appreciate what an explosive element...
Pulp.Fiction,"02:00:43,254","02:00:45,183",this Bonnie situation is.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:00:45,254","02:00:49,192","She comes home from a hard day's work, finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen..."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:00:49,253","02:00:51,192","doing a bunch of gangster shit,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:00:51,263","02:00:54,321",there ain't no tellin' what she's liable to do.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:00:56,494","02:00:58,433","Yeah, I grasp that, Jules."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:00:58,503","02:01:01,092",All I'm doing is contemplating the ifs.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:01:01,173","02:01:04,102",I don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin' ifs !
Pulp.Fiction,"02:01:04,173","02:01:08,101","All I want to hear from your ass is, ""You ain't got no problem, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:01:08,173","02:01:12,341","Chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which should be coming directly."""
Pulp.Fiction,"02:01:12,413","02:01:15,571","You ain't got no problem, Jules."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:01:15,652","02:01:17,771",I'm on the motherfucker.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:01:17,853","02:01:22,912","Chill them niggers out and wait for the Wolf, who should be coming directly."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:01:22,992","02:01:25,421",You sendin' the Wolf ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:01:25,492","02:01:27,681","Oh, you feel better, motherfucker ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:01:27,761","02:01:30,020","Shit, yeah, negro !"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:01:30,092","02:01:33,220",That's all you had to say !
Pulp.Fiction,"02:01:33,301","02:01:36,489",- She the hysterical type ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:01:36,571","02:01:39,500",- When is she due ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:01:39,571","02:01:41,660",Mm-hmm.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:01:41,740","02:01:43,669",Give me the principals' names again.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:01:43,741","02:01:45,680",Place your bets.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:01:46,740","02:01:50,408","- Jules. Mm-hmm. - Cards, please."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:01:50,481","02:01:52,420",Vincent.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:01:57,150","02:01:59,089",Jimmie.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:02:00,319","02:02:02,448",Bonnie. Mm-hmm.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:02:07,870","02:02:10,958",It's thirty minutes away. I'll be there in ten.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:02:27,778","02:02:30,707","You're... Jimmie, right ? This is your house ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:02:30,778","02:02:34,406",- It sure is. - I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:02:34,488","02:02:37,417",- Good. We got one. - So I heard. May I come in ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:02:37,488","02:02:39,417","Uh, yeah. Please do."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:02:39,487","02:02:43,145",You must be Jules. Which would make you... Vincent.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:02:43,228","02:02:45,657","Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:02:45,728","02:02:48,667","If I was informed correctly, the clock is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:02:48,727","02:02:50,666","Uh, one hundred percent."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:02:50,737","02:02:54,665","- Your wife Bonnie comes home at 9:30 in the a.m., correct ? - Uh-huh."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:02:54,737","02:02:59,226","I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it much."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:02:59,307","02:03:03,605","- She wouldn't at that. - That gives us 40 minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:03:03,677","02:03:07,115","which, if you do what I say, when I say it, should be plenty."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:03:07,186","02:03:11,514","Now, you got a corpse in a car, minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:03:19,256","02:03:21,195",- Jimmie. - Uh-huh.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:03:21,265","02:03:24,693","Do me a favor, will ya ? Thought I smelled some coffee back there."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:03:24,765","02:03:28,203","- Would you make me a cup ? - Uh, yeah, sure."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:03:29,664","02:03:32,603","Oh, uh, um, how do you take it ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:03:32,674","02:03:35,233","Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:03:37,315","02:03:40,743","About the car, is there anything I need to know ? Does it stall ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:03:40,814","02:03:44,252",Does it smoke ? Does it make a lot of noise ? ls there gas in it ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:03:44,314","02:03:47,752","- Aside from how it looks, the car's cool. - Positive ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:03:47,823","02:03:51,251",Don't get me on the road and I find out the brake lights don't work.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:03:51,323","02:03:55,381","- As far as I know, the motherfucker's tip-top. - Good enough."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:03:55,464","02:03:57,483",Let's go back to the kitchen.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:04:03,133","02:04:06,072","- Here you go, Mr. Wolf. - Thank you, Jimmie."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:04:10,913","02:04:12,842",Mmm.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:04:13,912","02:04:16,041","Okay, first thing. You two."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:04:16,113","02:04:19,052","Take the body, stick it in the trunk."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:04:19,112","02:04:21,841",This looks to be a pretty domesticated house.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:04:21,922","02:04:25,850",- That would lead me to believe you got cleansers and shit. - Yeah. Under the sink.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:04:25,921","02:04:29,359",Good. What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products...
Pulp.Fiction,"02:04:29,422","02:04:33,450","and clean the inside of the car-- I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:04:33,532","02:04:37,460","Go in the back seat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:04:37,531","02:04:40,470",Get it out of there. Wipe down the upholstery.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:04:40,540","02:04:43,469",It don't need to be spick-and-span. You don't need to eat off it.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:04:43,540","02:04:47,908",Just give it a good once-over. What you need to take care of are the really messy parts.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:04:47,981","02:04:52,069","The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:04:52,150","02:04:54,579",We need to raid your linen closet.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:04:54,650","02:04:57,579","I need blankets, I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:04:57,650","02:05:01,278","The thicker the better, the darker the better. No whites. Can't use 'em."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:05:01,359","02:05:06,658",We'll need to camouflage the front seat and back seat and floorboards...
Pulp.Fiction,"02:05:06,730","02:05:08,659","with quilts and blankets,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:05:08,730","02:05:12,668","so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:05:12,729","02:05:15,598",but at a glance the car will appear to be normal.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:05:15,669","02:05:17,728","Jimmie, lead the way. Boys, get to work."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:05:17,809","02:05:19,568","""Please"" would be nice."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:05:21,038","02:05:23,977","- Come again ? - I said, a ""please"" would be nice."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:05:25,878","02:05:29,706","Get it straight, buster. I'm not here to say please. I'm here to tell you what to do."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:05:31,518","02:05:34,447","And if self-preservation is an instinct you possess,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:05:34,517","02:05:36,956",you'd better fuckin' do it and do it quick.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:05:37,027","02:05:40,925","I'm here to help. If my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:05:40,998","02:05:44,326","No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that; your help is definitely appreciated."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:05:44,398","02:05:47,327","Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't mean disrespect, okay ? I respect you."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:05:47,397","02:05:50,196",I just don't like people barkin' orders at me.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:05:50,267","02:05:53,325","If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:05:53,407","02:05:58,036","I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if you wanna get out of this."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:05:58,107","02:06:01,545","So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:06:06,046","02:06:09,714","Don't be lookin' at me like that, all right ? I can feel your look."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:06:12,425","02:06:15,114",It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:06:17,196","02:06:19,125",Green.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:06:20,736","02:06:23,665",Nothin' except for the mess inside.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:06:25,865","02:06:28,304","Mmm, about 20 minutes."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:06:29,805","02:06:31,744",Nobody who'll be missed.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:06:33,815","02:06:36,744","You're a good man, Joe. Thanks a bunch."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:06:37,845","02:06:39,784","- How we comin', Jimmie ? - Pretty good."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:06:39,844","02:06:43,012","- I got it all here, but, uh,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:06:43,084","02:06:46,522","- Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something. - Winston, Jimmie, Winston."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:06:46,584","02:06:50,112","Okay. You gotta understand something, uh, Winston."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:06:50,193","02:06:52,122","Uh-- Uh, no, thank you."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:06:52,194","02:06:55,322","Uh, this is our best linen here,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:06:55,393","02:06:58,332","and it's, uh-- it was a wedding present..."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:06:58,403","02:07:00,832",from my Uncle Conrad and my Aunt Ginny.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:07:00,903","02:07:05,341",- They're not with us anymore. I wanna help-- - Let me ask you a question.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:07:05,403","02:07:08,342","- If you don't mind. - No, no, please. Go ahead."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:07:09,913","02:07:14,812","Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, were they millionaires ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:07:15,952","02:07:17,881",No.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:07:17,952","02:07:20,381","Well, your Uncle Marsellus is."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:07:20,452","02:07:23,910",And I'm positive that if Uncle Conrad and Aunt...
Pulp.Fiction,"02:07:23,991","02:07:26,420","- Ginny. - Ginny were here,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:07:26,491","02:07:30,759","they would furnish you with a whole bedroom set,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:07:30,831","02:07:33,959",which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:07:37,941","02:07:41,869",I like oak myself. That's what I have in my bedroom.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:07:43,010","02:07:44,939","How about you, Jimmie ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:07:46,181","02:07:48,110",You an oak man ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:07:49,211","02:07:51,150",Oak's nice.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:07:56,989","02:08:00,857","Oh, man, I will never forgive your ass for this shit."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:08:00,929","02:08:03,358","This is some fucked-up, repugnant shit."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:08:03,430","02:08:06,858","Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he is wrong..."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:08:06,930","02:08:09,869",that he is immediately forgiven for all wrongdoings ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:08:09,929","02:08:12,868",Get the fuck out my face with that shit !
Pulp.Fiction,"02:08:12,939","02:08:15,798",The motherfucker that said that shit never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull...
Pulp.Fiction,"02:08:15,869","02:08:19,637","- on account of your dumb ass. - I got a threshold, Jules, for the abuse that I will take."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:08:19,708","02:08:23,306","Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car, and you got me in the red."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:08:23,378","02:08:26,816",I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous to have a race car in the fuckin' red.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:08:26,878","02:08:28,817",That's all. I could blow.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:08:28,888","02:08:30,817","- Oh, you ready to blow ? - Yeah."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:08:30,888","02:08:33,817","Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker, motherfucker."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:08:33,888","02:08:36,827","Every time my fingers touch brain, I'm Superfly T.N.T."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:08:36,887","02:08:38,826",I'm the Guns of the Navarone.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:08:38,898","02:08:41,827","In fact, what the fuck am I doin' in the back ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:08:41,897","02:08:45,125",You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail ! We're fuckin' switchin'.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:08:45,197","02:08:47,636","I'm washin' windows, and you're pickin' up this nigger's skull !"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:08:57,417","02:08:59,346","Fine job, gentlemen."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:09:00,687","02:09:03,116",You may get out of this yet.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:09:03,186","02:09:05,615",I can't believe this is the same car.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:09:05,686","02:09:09,124","Well, let's not start suckin' each other's dicks quite yet."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:09:09,185","02:09:12,623",Phase one is complete-- Clean the car-- which moves us right along to Phase two:
Pulp.Fiction,"02:09:12,695","02:09:14,624",Clean you two.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:09:16,196","02:09:18,065",Strip.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:09:18,135","02:09:21,893",- All the way ? -  To your bare ass.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:09:21,965","02:09:25,063","Quickly, gentlemen. We got about 15 minutes..."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:09:25,135","02:09:28,074",before Jimmie's better half comes pulling into the driveway.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:09:28,145","02:09:30,634","Goddamn, this morning air is some chilly shit."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:09:30,714","02:09:32,663",Are you sure this is absolutely necessary ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:09:32,795","02:09:35,094",- You know what you two look like ? - What ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:09:35,164","02:09:38,602",Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:09:38,664","02:09:42,032",Strippin' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:09:46,344","02:09:48,813",Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:09:48,873","02:09:53,311","Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this shit out front for the garbageman to pick up."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:09:53,383","02:09:57,611","Don't worry, we're taking it with us. Jim, the soap."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:09:59,053","02:10:00,992","- Vincent. - Okay, gentlemen."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:10:01,053","02:10:04,551","You both been to County before, I'm sure. Here it comes."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:10:04,622","02:10:07,561",- Goddamn ! The water's fuckin' cold ! - Yo ! Yo ! Yo !
Pulp.Fiction,"02:10:07,633","02:10:10,861","Better you than me, gentlemen."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:10:10,932","02:10:13,871",- Don't be afraid of the soap. Spread it around.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:10:13,932","02:10:16,801","- Get 'em there a little bit. Vincent's hair. - Hey, get out of my hair !"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:10:16,872","02:10:19,771","- Come on. Do it, goddamn it ! Do it ! - Uh, um--"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:10:20,842","02:10:22,771",Towel.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:10:33,291","02:10:36,449",You're dry enough. Toss 'em their clothes.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:10:36,521","02:10:39,789",Perfect.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:10:39,861","02:10:43,319",Perfect. We couldn't have planned this better.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:10:43,401","02:10:45,330",You guys look like--
Pulp.Fiction,"02:10:45,401","02:10:47,830","What do they look like, Jimmie ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:10:47,901","02:10:51,499",- Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:10:51,570","02:10:55,058","- Ha-ha-ha. They're your clothes, motherfucker."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:10:55,139","02:10:57,868","Come on, gentlemen. We're laughing our way right into prison."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:10:57,939","02:10:59,878",Don't make me beg.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:11:02,950","02:11:06,378","Okay, gentlemen, let's get our rules of the road straight."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:11:06,450","02:11:10,008",We're going to a place called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:11:10,089","02:11:13,018",Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to our dilemma.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:11:13,088","02:11:14,987","The place is North Hollywood,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:11:15,059","02:11:19,047","so a few twists and turns aside, we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:11:19,129","02:11:22,457","Now, I'll drive the tainted car. Jules, you ride with me."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:11:23,869","02:11:25,798","Vincent, you follow in my Acura."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:11:25,868","02:11:29,806","Now, if we come across the path of any John Q. Laws,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:11:29,878","02:11:32,966",- nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something. - Right.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:11:33,048","02:11:35,977",- What did I say ? - Don't do shit unless.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:11:36,047","02:11:38,306",- Unless what ? - Unless you do it first.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:11:38,378","02:11:40,817",Spoken like a true prodigy.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:11:40,887","02:11:44,315","How about you, Lash LaRue ? Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:11:44,387","02:11:48,485",The gun went off. I don't know why. I'm cool. I promise you.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:11:48,556","02:11:51,495","Fair enough. Now, I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep up."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:11:51,556","02:11:54,055","If get my car back any different than I gave it,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:11:54,126","02:11:57,065",Monster Joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:12:00,906","02:12:02,595","Outta my way, Rex."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:12:04,176","02:12:06,605",- We cool ? - Like it never happened.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:12:06,675","02:12:10,443","-  All right. - Boys, this is Raquel."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:12:10,515","02:12:13,134",Someday all this will be hers.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:12:13,216","02:12:16,085","Hi. So, what's with the outfits ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:12:16,155","02:12:19,583",- You guys going to a volleyball game or something ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:12:19,655","02:12:22,084",I'm takin' milady out for breakfast.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:12:22,155","02:12:24,924",Maybe I could drop you two off. Where do you live ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:12:24,994","02:12:26,353",- Redondo. - Inglewood.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:12:26,425","02:12:29,863",It's-- It's your future. I--
Pulp.Fiction,"02:12:29,934","02:12:32,693",I see a-- a cab ride.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:12:32,765","02:12:35,734","Move outta the sticks, fellas. Say good night, Raquel."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:12:35,805","02:12:38,734","- Good night, Raquel. - I'll see you guys around."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:12:38,804","02:12:41,243","Stay outta trouble, you crazy kids."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:12:41,304","02:12:45,242","Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was a real pleasure watching you work."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:12:45,313","02:12:48,242","Yeah, really. And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:12:48,314","02:12:50,243",Call me Winston.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:12:51,813","02:12:54,752","- You see that, young lady ? Respect."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:12:54,823","02:12:59,021",- Respect for one's elders shows character. - I have character.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:12:59,093","02:13:03,121",- Because you are a character doesn't mean that you have character.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:13:09,702","02:13:12,631",- Wanna share a cab ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:13:12,702","02:13:16,970",- I'd go for some breakfast. Feel like havin' breakfast with me ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:13:17,042","02:13:19,841",Cool.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:13:23,882","02:13:26,970","I don't know why, I just thought he'd be European or something."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:13:27,051","02:13:30,489","- Yeah, he's about as European as fuckin' English Bob. - I know that now."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:13:30,551","02:13:32,990",- But was he cool or what ? - Thank you.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:13:33,061","02:13:35,490","Totally fuckin' cool, in control."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:13:35,560","02:13:39,618",Didn't even really get pissed when you were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:13:39,700","02:13:42,289",- Want some bacon ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:13:42,361","02:13:44,300","No, man, I don't eat pork."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:13:44,370","02:13:47,798","- Are you Jewish ? - I ain't Jewish; I just don't dig on swine, that's all."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:13:47,870","02:13:50,809",- Why not ? - Pigs are filthy animals.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:13:50,870","02:13:52,809",I don't eat filthy animals.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:13:52,880","02:13:56,308","Yeah, but bacon tastes good. Pork chops taste good."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:13:56,379","02:13:59,308","Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie, but I'd never know..."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:13:59,380","02:14:02,319",'cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:14:02,379","02:14:05,318",Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's a filthy animal.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:14:05,389","02:14:09,317",I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got sense enough to disregard its own feces.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:14:09,389","02:14:13,727",- What about a dog ? Dog eats its own feces. - I don't eat dog either.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:14:13,799","02:14:17,127","Yeah, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:14:17,199","02:14:20,128","I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:14:20,198","02:14:22,137",but they're definitely dirty.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:14:22,199","02:14:26,327","- But a dog's got personality. Personality goes a long way. - Ah, so, by that rationale,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:14:26,408","02:14:29,966","if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:14:30,047","02:14:33,975",- Is that true ? - We'd have to be talkin' about one charming motherfuckin' pig.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:14:34,047","02:14:38,075","I mean, he'd have to be ten times more charming than that Arnold on Green Acres."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:14:43,687","02:14:45,816","Oh, man, that's good."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:14:45,887","02:14:49,485","That's good, man. You're startin' to lighten up."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:14:49,567","02:14:52,555","You've been sittin' there, all serious and shit."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:14:52,636","02:14:55,065","- I just been sittin' here, thinkin'. - About what ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:14:55,137","02:14:58,066",- About the miracle we witnessed. - Miracle you witnessed.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:14:58,137","02:15:01,405","- I witnessed a freak occurrence. - What is a miracle, Vincent ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:15:03,306","02:15:06,504",- Act of God. - And what's an act of God ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:15:09,985","02:15:13,813","When, um, God makes the impossible possible."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:15:14,855","02:15:16,784",But this morning...
Pulp.Fiction,"02:15:16,855","02:15:19,584","- I don't think qualifies. - Hey, Vincent."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:15:19,655","02:15:23,353","See, that shit don't matter. You're judging this shit the wrong way."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:15:23,424","02:15:28,363","It could be God stopped the bullets, changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:15:28,435","02:15:31,423",You don't judge shit like this based on merit.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:15:31,504","02:15:33,933","Now, whether or not what we experienced..."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:15:34,005","02:15:37,163",was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:15:37,244","02:15:41,002","But what is significant is, I felt the touch of God."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:15:41,073","02:15:43,012",God got involved.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:15:43,084","02:15:44,803",But why ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:15:44,883","02:15:47,901","Well, that's what's fuckin' with me: I don't know why."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:15:47,984","02:15:50,953",- But I can't go back to sleep. - You're serious.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:15:51,024","02:15:52,953",You're really thinkin' about quittin'.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:15:53,023","02:15:55,682",- For life ? Most definitely. - Yeah.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:15:55,753","02:15:59,121",Fuck. What you gonna do then ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:16:00,433","02:16:04,661","Well, that's what I been sitting here contemplating."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:16:04,733","02:16:08,331",First I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:16:08,402","02:16:11,490","Then, basically, I'm just gonna walk the Earth."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:16:11,572","02:16:15,010","- What you mean, ""walk the Earth"" ? - Like Caine in Kung Fu."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:16:15,072","02:16:18,041","Walk from place to place, meet people, get in adventures."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:16:18,112","02:16:20,371",And how long do you intend to walk the Earth ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:16:20,451","02:16:23,749",- 'Til God puts me where He wants me to be. - What if He don't do that ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:16:23,822","02:16:28,751","- If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever. - So you decided to be a bum."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:16:28,821","02:16:32,479","I'll just be Jules, Vincent. No more, no less."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:16:32,561","02:16:34,530","No, Jules, you decided to be a bum,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:16:34,590","02:16:37,888","just like all those pieces of shit out there who beg for change,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:16:37,960","02:16:40,899","who sleep in garbage bins, eat what I throw away."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:16:40,971","02:16:43,940","They got a name for that, Jules. It's called a bum."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:16:44,000","02:16:47,668","And without a job, a residence or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be, man."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:16:47,740","02:16:49,669",You're gonna be a fuckin' bum.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:16:49,740","02:16:52,679","Look, my friend, this is just where you and I differ."

Pulp.Fiction,"02:16:55,649","02:17:00,138","Jules, look, what happened this morning, man, I agree it was peculiar."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:17:00,220","02:17:03,348","- But water into wine, l-- - All shapes and sizes, Vincent."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:17:03,420","02:17:06,518","- Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man. - If my answers frighten you,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:17:06,589","02:17:09,188",then you should cease asking scary questions.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:17:12,059","02:17:13,998",I'm gonna take a shit.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:17:16,869","02:17:20,617",Let me ask you something.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:17:20,749","02:17:22,878",When did you make this decision ? When you were sittin' there eatin' that muffin ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:17:22,948","02:17:26,886","Yeah. I was sittin' here eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:17:26,958","02:17:28,887","replayin' the incident in my head,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:17:28,958","02:17:32,756",when I had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:17:32,827","02:17:35,955",Fuck. To be continued.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:17:47,977","02:17:50,906","- I love you, Pumpkin. - I love you, Honey Bunny."

Pulp.Fiction,"02:18:38,793","02:18:42,811",Thought you said you were gonna give me a fucking problem !
Pulp.Fiction,"02:18:42,893","02:18:47,592","- I think we got a hero here, Honey Bunny. - Well, just execute him !"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:18:47,663","02:18:49,602",- I am not a hero.

Pulp.Fiction,"02:23:09,109","02:23:12,048","I want you to let go of your gun,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:23:12,118","02:23:15,566",put your palms flat on the table and sit your ass down.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:23:16,648","02:23:18,707","And when you do it,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:23:18,788","02:23:20,847",you do it cool.

Pulp.Fiction,"02:23:36,667","02:23:39,795","-  Okay, now you let him go ! - Yolanda !"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:23:39,877","02:23:43,465","I thought you were gonna be cool. Now, when you yell at me, it makes me nervous."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:23:43,547","02:23:45,636","When I get nervous, I get scared."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:23:45,716","02:23:49,544","When motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers accidentally get shot."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:23:51,186","02:23:54,814","Just know, you hurt him, you die."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:23:54,886","02:23:58,284","Well, that seems to be the situation."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:23:58,356","02:24:00,295",But I don't want that.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:24:00,355","02:24:02,294",And you don't want that.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:24:02,366","02:24:05,095",And Ringo here definitely doesn't want that.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:24:05,165","02:24:07,254",So let's see what we can do.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:24:09,665","02:24:12,903",Now... here's the situation.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:24:12,975","02:24:16,843","Normally both your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:24:16,905","02:24:20,343","but you happened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:24:20,415","02:24:23,344",and I don't wanna kill you; I wanna help you.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:24:23,414","02:24:27,352","But I can't give you this case, 'cause it don't belong to me."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:24:27,424","02:24:30,353","Besides, I been through too much shit over this case this morning..."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:24:30,424","02:24:33,353",to just hand it over to your dumb ass.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:24:33,424","02:24:35,293",- Vincent !
Pulp.Fiction,"02:24:35,364","02:24:38,293","- Be cool ! Yolanda, it's cool, baby. - Get back !"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:24:38,364","02:24:41,063",It's cool ! We still just talkin'.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:24:41,133","02:24:45,291",- Come on. Point the gun at me. Point the gun at me. There you go.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:24:45,373","02:24:47,432","Now, Vincent, you just hang back..."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:24:47,503","02:24:49,442",and don't do a goddamn thing.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:24:49,503","02:24:51,442",Tell her it's still cool.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:24:51,513","02:24:54,442","- It's still cool, Honey Bunny. - How we doin', baby ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:24:55,843","02:24:58,512",I-- I gotta go pee.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:24:58,582","02:25:00,511",I wanna go home.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:25:00,583","02:25:04,181","Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you. And Ringo's proud of you."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:25:04,253","02:25:07,192",It's almost over. Tell her you're proud of her.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:25:07,252","02:25:10,620","- I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny. - I love you."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:25:10,692","02:25:13,850","- I love you too, Honey Bunny. - Now,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:25:13,932","02:25:17,860",I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:25:20,401","02:25:24,339","- Which one is it ? - It's the one that says ""Bad Motherfucker."""
Pulp.Fiction,"02:25:38,600","02:25:41,159",That's it. That's my bad motherfucker.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:25:41,230","02:25:44,328",Open it up. Take out the money.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:25:49,380","02:25:51,539",Count it.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:25:57,850","02:26:00,379",How much is there ?
Pulp.Fiction,"02:26:02,289","02:26:04,218","About 1,500 dollars."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:26:04,289","02:26:07,487","Okay, put it in your pocket. It's yours."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:26:07,559","02:26:10,757","Now, with the rest of those wallets and the register,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:26:10,829","02:26:12,918","that makes this a pretty successful little score, huh ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:26:12,999","02:26:16,897","Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod 1,500 dollars, and I'll shoot him on general principle."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:26:16,968","02:26:20,406","No, Yolanda ! Yolanda ! He ain't gonna do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing !"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:26:20,468","02:26:22,567","Vince, shut the fuck up !"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:26:22,637","02:26:26,505","- Shut up ! - Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:26:26,577","02:26:29,506","Now, I ain't givin' it to him, Vincent."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:26:29,578","02:26:31,517",I'm buyin' something for my money.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:26:32,747","02:26:35,945","- Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo ? - What ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:26:36,017","02:26:40,756",Your life. I'm givin' you that money so I don't have to kill your ass.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:26:40,826","02:26:43,515","You read the Bible, Ringo ?"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:26:44,596","02:26:46,525","Not regularly, no."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:26:46,597","02:26:49,026","Well, there's this passage I got memorized."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:26:49,097","02:26:52,625",Ezekiel 25:17.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:26:52,706","02:26:55,535","""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides..."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:26:55,606","02:26:57,535",by the inequities of the selfish...
Pulp.Fiction,"02:26:57,606","02:26:59,535",and the tyranny of evil men.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:26:59,605","02:27:02,973","Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:27:03,045","02:27:05,474","shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:27:05,546","02:27:09,644",for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:27:09,716","02:27:14,014",And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...
Pulp.Fiction,"02:27:14,085","02:27:17,143",those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:27:17,224","02:27:20,252",And you will know I am the Lord...
Pulp.Fiction,"02:27:20,324","02:27:23,882","when I lay My vengeance upon you."""
Pulp.Fiction,"02:27:24,965","02:27:27,404","I been sayin' that shit for years,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:27:27,465","02:27:30,633","and if you heard it, that meant your ass."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:27:30,704","02:27:33,643",I never gave much thought to what it meant.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:27:33,704","02:27:36,643",I just thought it was some coldblooded shit to say to a motherfucker...
Pulp.Fiction,"02:27:36,714","02:27:39,143",before I popped a cap in his ass.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:27:39,213","02:27:42,641",But I saw some shit this morning made me think twice.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:27:42,714","02:27:45,653","See, now I'm thinkin' maybe it means..."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:27:45,724","02:27:50,583","you're the evil man, and I'm the righteous man,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:27:50,653","02:27:53,592","and Mr. 9-millimeter here, he's the shepherd..."
Pulp.Fiction,"02:27:53,663","02:27:57,221",protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:27:57,292","02:27:59,231",Or it could mean...
Pulp.Fiction,"02:27:59,303","02:28:02,731","you're the righteous man, and I'm the shepherd,"
Pulp.Fiction,"02:28:02,803","02:28:06,741",and it's the world that's evil and selfish.
Pulp.Fiction,"02:28:06,802","02:28:09,071","Now, I'd like that."
