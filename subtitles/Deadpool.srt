Little help...

18
00:02:40,748 --> 00:02:45,115
Just... I have to keep
my hands on the wheel.

19
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:46,980
Excuse me!

20
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:52,109
- Dopinder.
- Pool. Dead.

21
00:02:54,612 --> 00:02:57,490
- Nice!
- Smells good, no?

22
00:02:57,568 --> 00:02:59,368
Not the daffodil
daydream. The girl.

23
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:03,073
Yes. Gita.
She is quite lovely.

24
00:03:03,173 --> 00:03:05,915
She would have made me
a very agreeable wife.

25
00:03:06,024 --> 00:03:06,984
But...

26
00:03:07,077 --> 00:03:10,880
Gita's heart has been
stolen by my cousin, Bandu.

27
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:15,484
He is as dishonorable
as he is attractive.

28
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:17,367
Dopinder,

29
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,398
I'm starting to think there's a
reason I'm in this cab today.

30
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:22,370
Yes, sir, you called
for it, remember?

31
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:24,402
No, my slender, brown friend.
Love...

32
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:26,423
is a beautiful thing.

33
00:03:26,432 --> 00:03:30,608
When you find it, the whole world
tastes like daffodil daydream.

34
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:34,403
So you gotta hold
on to love. Tight!

35
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:38,609
And never let go. Don't make the
same mistakes I did, got it?

36
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:42,713
Or else the whole world tastes
like Mama June after hot yoga.

37
00:03:43,113 --> 00:03:45,515
Sir, what does Miss
Mama June taste like?

38
00:03:45,716 --> 00:03:48,668
Like two hobos fucking in
a shoe filled with piss.

39
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:51,629
I can go all day, Dopinder.
The point is it's bad.

40
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:55,926
Why the fancy
red suit, Mr. Pool?

41
00:03:56,126 --> 00:03:58,497
Oh, that's because it's
Christmas day, Dopinder,

42
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:00,539
and I'm after someone
on my naughty list.

43
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:04,280
I've been waiting, 1 year,
3 weeks, 6 days and...

44
00:04:04,288 --> 00:04:07,645
14 minutes to make him
fix what he did to me.

45
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,506
And what did he do
to you, Mr. Pool?

46
00:04:10,514 --> 00:04:11,723
This shit.

47
00:04:13,716 --> 00:04:14,717
Boo!

48
00:04:34,737 --> 00:04:38,741
- They won't disappoint.
- They'd better not!

49
00:04:38,842 --> 00:04:42,145
- What about next month's shipment?
- There won't be one.

50
00:04:42,906 --> 00:04:45,218
You're not the only
one with a war to win.

51
00:04:45,748 --> 00:04:47,950
That won't do.

52
00:04:49,752 --> 00:04:54,456
See, we've had this small
disruption to our supply trade.

53
00:04:57,815 --> 00:05:01,819
We'd appreciate your patience.

54
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,422
Okay...

55
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:06,350
We'll deliver in full
the following month.

56
00:05:10,253 --> 00:05:12,255
Pleasure doing
business with you.

57
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:17,260
Fucking mutant!

58
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,273
Shit! I forgot my ammo bag!

59
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:34,778
- Shall we turn back?
- No time. Fuck it. I got this.

60
00:05:34,977 --> 00:05:39,282
9, 10, 11, 12 bullets.
Or bust. Right here!

61
00:05:41,284 --> 00:05:43,686
That's $27.50.

62
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:47,791
I never carry a wallet while I'm
working. Ruins the lines of my suit.

63
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,967
- But how 'bout a crisp high-five?
- Okay.

64
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:52,384
Merry Christmas!

65
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:56,024

and April to you too, Pool!

00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:20,857
I know, right?

74
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:25,069
Whose balls did I have to fondle
to get my very own movie?

75
00:06:25,162 --> 00:06:26,237
I can't tell you,

76
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:29,975
but it does rhyme with "Pulverine".
And lemme tell you...

77
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:34,270
He's got a nice pair of
smooth criminals down under!

78
00:06:34,571 --> 00:06:38,324
Anyway. I got places to be.
A face to fix. And, oh!

79
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:40,577
Bad guys to kill.

80
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:48,284
Maximum effort.

81
00:06:57,293 --> 00:06:58,895
Cock shot!

82
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:09,305
Rich, Corinthian leather!

83
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:12,909
I'm looking for Francis!

84
00:07:13,109 --> 00:07:15,012
Have you seen this man?

85
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,823
Yanking, yanking!

86
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:01,058
I've never said this,
but don't swallow.

87
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:25,982
Shit. Did I leave the stove on?

88
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:45,202
Now, breaking news.

89
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:49,405
A multi-car collision turned shots fired
on the crosstown expressway this morning.

90
00:08:49,506 --> 00:08:51,628
Gridlock has kept
police from the scene.

91
00:08:51,637 --> 00:08:54,118
Residents are advised to
remain in their homes.

92
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,413
The assailant appears to be
armed, dangerous, and wearing a...

93
00:08:57,514 --> 00:09:00,416
Red suit. Deadpool.

94
00:09:00,517 --> 00:09:03,621
Negasonic! Come.
We have mission.

95
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,322
Colossus, wait up.

96
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:09,926
I've given Deadpool
every chance to join us.

97
00:09:10,127 --> 00:09:14,931
But he'd rather act like
a child. A heavily armed child.

98
00:09:15,132 --> 00:09:18,835
When will he grow up and see
benefits of becoming X-Man?

99
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:21,037
Which benefits,
the matching unitards?

100
00:09:21,046 --> 00:09:23,147
The house that blows
up every few years?

101
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:26,442
Please. House blowing
up builds character.

102
00:09:26,543 --> 00:09:31,848
You ate breakfast, yes? Breakfast
is most important meal of day.

103
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:36,153
Here. Protein bar.
Good for bones.

104
00:09:36,352 --> 00:09:38,955
Deadpool may try
to break yours.

105
00:10:06,483 --> 00:10:08,084
Hey!

106
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:22,599
Wait! You may be wondering
why the red suit.

107
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,401
Well that's so bad guys
can't see me bleed.

108
00:10:25,502 --> 00:10:28,404
This guy's got the right idea.
He wore the brown pants.

109
00:10:30,507 --> 00:10:34,211
Fine! I only have 12 bullets, so
you're gonna have to share!

110
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,012
Let's count 'em down!

111
00:10:56,132 --> 00:11:01,437
Shit, motherfucker!

112
00:11:01,538 --> 00:11:03,340
Ten! Shit.

113
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:08,144
Nine! Fuck.
Eight. Shit-fuck!

114
00:11:11,348 --> 00:11:13,149
Bad Deadpool.

115
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,553
Seven. Good Deadpool!

116
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,377
Someone's not counting.

117
00:11:40,477 --> 00:11:41,578
Six!

118
00:12:07,604 --> 00:12:09,606
Four...

119
00:12:11,308 --> 00:12:12,609
Gotcha!

120
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,112
Right up main street!

121
00:12:19,616 --> 00:12:23,320
Three, two! Stupid!
Worth it.

122
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:51,648
I'm touching myself tonight.

123
00:12:51,748 --> 00:12:54,651
Francis! Francis!

124
00:12:56,653 --> 00:13:01,257
What the shitbiscuit!
Where you at, Francis?

125
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,668
You're not Francis!

126
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:21,678
Really? Rolling up the sleeves?

127
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:34,671
You're probably thinking, "my boyfriend
said this was a superhero movie

128
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:38,695
but that guy in the red suit just turned
that other guy into a fucking kebab.

129
00:13:38,696 --> 00:13:42,900
Well, I may be super.
But I'm no hero.

130
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,611
Anyhow, technically,
this is a murder.

131
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,313
But some of the best love
stories start with a murder.

132
00:13:48,506 --> 00:13:52,559
And that's exactly what this is:
a love story. And to tell it right,

133
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:57,515
I gotta take you back to long before
I squeeze this ass into red spandex.

134
00:13:57,714 --> 00:14:03,319
Look, would it help if I slow it down
for you? I didn't order the pizza.

135
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:06,623
Is this 7348 Redledge Drive?

136
00:14:06,723 --> 00:14:07,816
Are you Mr. Merchant?

137
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:11,336
The Mr. Merchant who didn't
order the fucking pie!

138
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:14,330
- Who placed the call?
- I did!

139
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:21,337
Pineapple and olive?
Sweet and salty!

140
00:14:21,438 --> 00:14:24,340
The fuck are you? The fuck
are you doing in my crib?

141
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:27,945
- Is that bread crust? Don't move!
- God, I hope not.

142
00:14:28,045 --> 00:14:31,748
Look, is this about that
poker game? I told Howie...

143
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,753
- Just take whatever you want.
- Thanks!

144
00:14:37,153 --> 00:14:40,958
Sir, before you do anything to him,
do you mind if I get a big tip?

145
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:45,762
- Jeremy, is it? Wade Wilson.
- Yeah.

146
00:14:45,862 --> 00:14:49,467
That is a no go on
the tip-aroo, Jer.

147
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:52,769
I'm not here for him.
I'm here for you.

148
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,478
I dodged a big-time
bullet on that one!

149
00:14:56,487 --> 00:14:58,583
Not, out of the woods yet.

150
00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:01,647
You need to seriously ease
up on the bedazzling.

151
00:15:01,656 --> 00:15:03,588
They're jeans, not a chandelier.

152
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,080
Yes I'm keeping your wallet.
You did kind of give it to me.

153
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:10,588
- Just look, man, can I have my...
- I will shoot your fucking cat.

154
00:15:10,787 --> 00:15:12,990
I don't really know what that
means, I don't have a cat.

155
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,792
Then whose kitty litter
did I just shit in?

156
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:20,097
Anywho...

157
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:24,801
Tell me something. What situation
isn't improved by pizza?

158
00:15:25,102 --> 00:15:29,405
Do you happen to know a Megan
Orflosky? Get that right? Orflovsky?

159
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:34,512
'Cause she knows you. Jeremy...

160
00:15:34,811 --> 00:15:38,214
I belong to a group of guys who
take a dime to beat a fella down.

161
00:15:38,414 --> 00:15:43,020
And little Megan, she's not made of money,
but lucky for her, I got a soft spot.

162
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,822
- I'm.....
- A stalker.

163
00:15:45,922 --> 00:15:50,827
Threats hurt, Jer. Though not
nearly as badly as serrated steel.

164
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:56,833
- So keep away from Megan. Cool?
- Yes, sir.

165
00:15:56,933 --> 00:15:59,836
- And we're done.
- Wait, we are?

166
00:15:59,936 --> 00:16:03,641
Totally done. You
should've seen your face!

167
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,771
I didn't know what to
do, I was so scared...

168
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,852
Soft spot, remember?

169
00:16:07,844 --> 00:16:12,074
Even look in her general direction again
and you will learn in the worst of ways

170
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,859
that I have some
hard spots, too.

171
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:16,853
That came out wrong.

172
00:16:17,854 --> 00:16:19,856
Or did it?

173
00:16:31,868 --> 00:16:33,870
Megan.

174
00:16:35,872 --> 00:16:39,076
You've heard the last
of Jeremy. He's sorry.

175
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,878
No friggin' way.

176
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:48,886
Should've brought my roller blades.
Show these kids how it's done.

177
00:16:49,085 --> 00:16:51,889
And that's why we do it.
But mostly the money.

178
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:53,891
Hey. Think you can
fuck up my step dad?

179
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,894
If I can give the guy a pavement
facial, it's 'cause he's earned it.

180
00:16:57,194 --> 00:16:58,896
Hey, wait.

181
00:16:59,897 --> 00:17:03,901
- You're my hero.
- No, no, no, no, no. That, I ain't.

182
00:17:05,903 --> 00:17:10,708
Nope. Never will be.
- Fuck you, Wade.

183
00:17:10,807 --> 00:17:13,911
I'm just a bad guy who gets
paid to fuck up worse guys.

184
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:19,917
Welcome to Sister Margaret's.
It's like a job fair for mercenaries.

185
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:22,246
Think of us as really
fucked up tooth fairies

186
00:17:22,255 --> 00:17:24,629
except we knock out the
teeth and take the cash.

187
00:17:24,922 --> 00:17:28,692
You'd best hope we never see
your name on a gold card.

188
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:29,934
(Buck! Liefeld.)

189
00:17:30,126 --> 00:17:32,930
- Hey, Wade!
- Wade Wilson. Patron Saint of the Pitiful.

190
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:35,933
- What can I do for you?
- I'd love a blowjob.

191
00:17:36,032 --> 00:17:40,237
- Oh, God, me too.
- The drink. With snuggle. But first...

192
00:17:40,938 --> 00:17:43,358
- Hey, I ain't taking
any babysitting money,

193
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:45,950
make sure that gets back to Miss...
- Orlovsky?

194
00:17:46,944 --> 00:17:48,445
- You sure?
- Hmm.

195
00:17:48,445 --> 00:17:50,420
For a merc, you're
pretty warm-blooded.

196
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:52,456
Bet you let the kid
off easy, too.

197
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,350
He's not a bad kid.

198
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:56,035
Just a little light stalking.

199
00:17:56,044 --> 00:17:59,972
I was way worse when I was his age,
travelling to exotic places...

200
00:18:00,056 --> 00:18:01,759
Baghdad, Mogadishu,
Jacksonville,

201
00:18:01,768 --> 00:18:04,168
meeting new and exciting people.
And then..

202
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:06,529
Killing them. Yeah, I've
seen your instagram.

203
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:09,274
So what were special forces
doing in Jacksonville?

204
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:12,970
That's classified. They
have wonderful TGIFridays!

205
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:16,974
Alright, kahlua, baileys
and whipped cream.

206
00:18:17,073 --> 00:18:18,976
I give you, a blowjob. I'm...

207
00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:21,979
- Why do you make me make that?
- Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...

208
00:18:22,078 --> 00:18:26,283
Take that over there to Buck, please and
tell him it's from Booth. Little foreplay.

209
00:18:26,484 --> 00:18:28,480
Remind me what good
will come of this?

210
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:30,995
I don't take the shits,
I just disturb them.

211
00:18:31,989 --> 00:18:33,991
What you want?

212
00:18:35,993 --> 00:18:39,997
- Cheers. To your health.
- Fuck you.

213
00:18:40,998 --> 00:18:43,000
That's a new stool.

214
00:18:48,005 --> 00:18:50,007
Stay the fuck down.

215
00:18:54,011 --> 00:18:56,112
Alright, move, move, move, move.

216
00:18:56,212 --> 00:18:57,213
Buck, go rest.

217
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:06,023
He's still breathing.

218
00:19:08,025 --> 00:19:12,029
Nobody wins today. Nice try, Wade.

219
00:19:12,128 --> 00:19:15,032
You got me. I picked Booth in
the dead pool. Who did you pick?

220
00:19:16,033 --> 00:19:21,038
- You know, Wade, about that....
- No. You did not bet on me to die.

221
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,402
You bet on me to die.

222
00:19:24,411 --> 00:19:27,853
Wow. Motherfucker, you're
the world's worst friend.

223
00:19:28,045 --> 00:19:30,310
Well, joke's on you.
I'm living to 102.

224
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,557
And then die. At the
city of Detroit.

225
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:34,898
I'm sorry. I wanted
to win money.

226
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,961
I never win anything.

227
00:19:37,054 --> 00:19:40,256
Whatever. Soldiers of
fortune, drink's on me!

228
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:41,366
Yeah!

229
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:44,061
Domestic! Nothing imported.

230
00:19:46,063 --> 00:19:48,465
Woah, woah, woah. Baby...

231
00:19:49,066 --> 00:19:51,068
Are you sure you wanna
shoot your whole wad?

232
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:56,073
Tight.

233
00:19:56,574 --> 00:19:58,576
- Vanessa.
- Wade.

234
00:19:59,076 --> 00:20:02,079
What's a nice place like
you doing in a girl like this?

235
00:20:02,178 --> 00:20:04,081
I'd hit that.

236
00:20:05,082 --> 00:20:09,086
Buck, you'd best apologize
before... yeah. That.

237
00:20:09,185 --> 00:20:12,089
- Say the magic words, fat Gandalf.
- I'm sorry.

238
00:20:12,188 --> 00:20:13,409
Breathe through the nose.

239
00:20:13,418 --> 00:20:16,100
I don't have a filter
between my brain and my...

240
00:20:16,192 --> 00:20:20,097
Okay, hey. Hakuna
his tatas, he's sorry!

241
00:20:20,196 --> 00:20:22,471
Get outta here. Go cast a spell.

242
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,109
Hey, hands off the merchandise.

243
00:20:26,103 --> 00:20:30,107
Merchandise, huh. So you...

244
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:33,110
- Fun fuzzies for money?
- Yup.

245
00:20:33,209 --> 00:20:34,232
Rough childhood?

246
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:37,021
Rougher than yours.
Daddy left before I was born.

247
00:20:37,114 --> 00:20:40,117
Daddy left before I was conceived.

248
00:20:40,216 --> 00:20:41,918
Ever had a cigarette
put out on your skin?

249
00:20:41,927 --> 00:20:43,127
Where else do you put one out?

250
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:45,923
- I was molested.
- Me, too. Uncle.

251
00:20:46,123 --> 00:20:48,125
Uncles. They took turns.

252
00:20:48,134 --> 00:20:50,175
I watched my own birthday
party through the keyhole

253
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:52,144
of a locked closet which
also happens to be my...

254
00:20:52,228 --> 00:20:56,133
Your bedroom. Lucky. I
slept in a dishwasher box.

255
00:20:56,232 --> 00:20:57,675
You had a dishwasher.

256
00:20:57,684 --> 00:20:59,303
I didn't even know sleep.

257
00:20:59,312 --> 00:21:03,456
It was pretty much 24/7 ball kegs,
brownie mix and clown porn.

258
00:21:06,143 --> 00:21:08,145
Who would do such a thing?

259
00:21:09,146 --> 00:21:13,150
Hopefully, you.
Later tonight?

260
00:21:16,153 --> 00:21:23,160
What can I get for 275 dollars
and a yogurt rewards card?

261
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:26,163
Baby, about 48 minutes of
whatever the fuck you want.

262
00:21:27,164 --> 00:21:30,167
And a low-fat dessert.

263
00:21:36,173 --> 00:21:39,176
Did she just put a gift
card in your mouth?

264
00:21:40,177 --> 00:21:43,180
It's time to put
balls in holes.

265
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,183
- You said whatever I want.
- I get it.

266
00:21:47,184 --> 00:21:50,622
You love ski ball. Apparently
more than you love vagina.

267
00:21:50,631 --> 00:21:52,196
That's a tough call.

268
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,590
I just wanna get to
know the real you.

269
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,659
Not the short-

270
00:21:56,668 --> 00:22:00,113
shorted 2-dimensional sex
object peddled by Hollywood.

271
00:22:00,197 --> 00:22:02,199
Balls in holes.

272
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,203
- Prepare to lose tragically.
- Bring it, big man.

273
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:18,214
A limited edition Voltron: Defender
of the Universe ring, por favor.

274
00:22:18,215 --> 00:22:20,217
Okay. Here you go.

275
00:22:21,218 --> 00:22:23,220
I had this sucker for a while.

276
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:25,723
- And I will take the pencil eraser.
- Okay.

277
00:22:26,223 --> 00:22:29,980
You are now the proud
protector of the planet Arus.

278
00:22:29,989 --> 00:22:33,237
And you, can erase stuff.
Written in pencil.

279
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:34,410
Milady.

280
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:38,343
I hate to break it to you,
but your 48 minutes are up.

281
00:22:38,736 --> 00:22:41,238
How many more minutes
could I get for this?

282
00:22:41,337 --> 00:22:46,243
FYI, 5 mini lion bots come
together to form 1 superbot.

283
00:22:46,342 --> 00:22:48,897
5 mini lion bots? 3 minutes.

284
00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:53,559
Deal. What do we do with
the remaining 2:37?

285
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:54,752
Cuddle?

286
00:22:59,256 --> 00:23:03,260
- How long can we keep this up?
- All year?

287
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:15,272
Happy Valentines' Day.

288
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:25,282
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Year of the Dog.

289
00:23:30,287 --> 00:23:35,292
Relax... and happy
International Women's Day.

290
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:46,303
Happy Lenten.

291
00:23:50,307 --> 00:23:55,312
- Wade!
- Sorry. Happy Halloween!

292
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,323
Happy Thanksgiving.

293
00:24:07,324 --> 00:24:09,326
I love you.

294
00:24:12,329 --> 00:24:16,333
If your left leg is Thanksgiving,
and your right leg is Christmas...

295
00:24:16,933 --> 00:24:20,337
Can I visit you
between the holidays?

296
00:24:20,436 --> 00:24:23,340
That sweater is terrible!

297
00:24:24,341 --> 00:24:26,343
But red looks good on you.

298
00:24:26,443 --> 00:24:29,346
Red's your color. Mine's like
the bloodshot in your eyes.

299
00:24:29,746 --> 00:24:31,649
- Listen. I've been thinking.
- Really?

300
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:36,353
- 'Bout why we're so good together.
- Why is that?

301
00:24:37,354 --> 00:24:41,358
Your crazy matches
my crazy. Bigtime.

302
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:46,363
And we're like 2 jigsaw
pieces. Weird curvy edges?

303
00:24:46,463 --> 00:24:49,586
You put them together and you
can see the picture on top.

304
00:24:49,595 --> 00:24:50,676
Right.

305
00:24:51,368 --> 00:24:55,372
Wade... There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.

306
00:24:55,472 --> 00:24:58,375
But only because you haven't
gotten around to asking me.

307
00:24:59,376 --> 00:25:01,378
Will you...

308
00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:05,382
- Stick it up my...
- ...Marry me?

309
00:25:06,383 --> 00:25:08,385
Uh... Jinx?

310
00:25:10,387 --> 00:25:12,389
- Where were you hiding that?
- Nowhere.

311
00:25:12,489 --> 00:25:15,792
- They said 1-month salary, so...
- You mean...

312
00:25:15,992 --> 00:25:18,395
- I do.
- That's my line.

313
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:25,101
- I love you, Wade Wilson.
- You're supposed to... So that's a...

314
00:25:25,402 --> 00:25:27,404
- Yes!
- Woo! Yes!

315
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:32,409
I feel just like a little girl!

316
00:25:37,414 --> 00:25:40,120
What if I just held
on and never let go?

317
00:25:40,129 --> 00:25:43,427
Just ride the bitch's
back like Yoda on Luke.

318
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,424
- Star Wars jokes!
- Empire!

319
00:25:48,425 --> 00:25:51,428
Jesus Christ, it's like I
made you in a computer!

320
00:25:57,434 --> 00:25:59,436
Perfect.

321
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:06,444
Pee break. Shake it, yeah.

322
00:26:11,449 --> 00:26:13,451
Here's the thing:

323
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,718
Life is an endless
series of train wrecks

324
00:26:15,727 --> 00:26:18,463
with only brief commercial-like
breaks of happiness.

325
00:26:19,457 --> 00:26:23,461
This had been the
ultimate commercial break.

326
00:26:24,462 --> 00:26:28,466
Which meant it was time to return,
to our regularly scheduled programme.

327
00:26:28,766 --> 00:26:31,469
- What the fu.....
- Oh my God, Wade!

328
00:26:37,475 --> 00:26:42,480
You're clowning. You're
not clowning. I sense clowns.

329
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,484
People react to news of late-
stage cancer differently.

330
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:49,176
There are certainly
options we can look into.

331
00:26:49,185 --> 00:26:51,496
New drugs are being
developed every day.

332
00:26:54,492 --> 00:26:59,497
So what do we do? Surely,
there is something we can do.

333
00:26:59,596 --> 00:27:02,355
My Uncle Ivan was diagnosed
with Thyroid cancer

334
00:27:02,364 --> 00:27:05,811
and there were all these
experimental drugs from Germany...

335
00:27:06,003 --> 00:27:09,507
Vanessa's already working on plan
A, B, all the way through Z.

336
00:27:10,508 --> 00:27:13,758
Me? I'm memorizing the
details of her face.

337
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:16,721
Like it's the first
time I'm seeing it.

338
00:27:17,113 --> 00:27:19,517
- Or the last...
- Mr. Wilson, Mr. Wilson?

339
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,103
Take your time to process this.

340
00:27:24,112 --> 00:27:27,532
It's important not
to do anything rash.

341
00:27:38,536 --> 00:27:43,541
Now, if I were a 200 pound sack of assholes
named Francis, where would I hide?

342
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:13,605
"A hush falls over the crowd
as rookie sensation Wade W.

343
00:28:13,614 --> 00:28:17,582
Wilson out of Regina,
Saskatchewan, lines up the shot."

344
00:28:18,576 --> 00:28:20,578
"His form looks good."

345
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:27,084
"And that's why Regina
rhymes with fun."

346
00:28:27,283 --> 00:28:31,889
"Ladies and gentlemen, what you're
witnessing is sweet, dick-kicking revenge!"

347
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:36,594
"Giving him the business! Incoming!"

348
00:28:36,693 --> 00:28:40,598
"This is taking unsportsman-like
conduct to a whole new level!"

349
00:28:45,603 --> 00:28:49,406
Looking good, Francis. Well-rested.
Like you've been pitching, not catching.

350
00:28:49,607 --> 00:28:52,610
Ringing any bells? No?

351
00:28:56,614 --> 00:28:58,616
How 'bout now?

352
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:04,622
Wade fucking Wilson.

353
00:29:06,624 --> 00:29:08,091
Well, hello, gorgeous.

354
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,636
Yeah, like I got bit by
a radioactive Shar Pei.

355
00:29:11,728 --> 00:29:16,631
And whose fault is that, huh, Francis? Time
to undo what you did to this butter face.

356
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:17,811
You should thank me.

357
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,646
Apparently, I've made you immortal.
I'm actually quite jealous.

358
00:29:21,738 --> 00:29:25,142
Yeah, but this ain't a
life worth living, is it? Now...

359
00:29:25,643 --> 00:29:30,648
I'm about to do to you what Limp
Bizkit did to music in the late 90's.

360
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:33,651
Dad?

361
00:29:36,654 --> 00:29:40,658
I think we can all agree that shit just
went sideways in the most colossal way.

362
00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:44,260
Well, maybe not the most.

363
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:48,165
Now this, is my
most prized possession.

364
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:52,169
- Wham?
- No, no, no, no. WHAM!

365
00:29:52,429 --> 00:29:55,673
Make It Big is the album that George and
Andy earned the exclamation point.

366
00:29:55,772 --> 00:29:59,677
So, am I supposed to just
smile and wave you out the door?

367
00:29:59,776 --> 00:30:02,680
Think of it like spring cleaning.
Only if spring was death.

368
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:06,684
God, if I had a nickel for everytime I
spanked at the Bernadette Peters.

369
00:30:07,685 --> 00:30:10,720
Sounds like you have.
Bernadette is not going...

370
00:30:10,746 --> 00:30:13,714
anywhere, because you're
not going anywhere.

371
00:30:14,358 --> 00:30:15,659
- Drink.
- You're right.

372
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:19,363
Cancer's only in my liver, lungs, prostate
and brain. All things I can live without.

373
00:30:21,365 --> 00:30:23,013
You belong here at home.

374
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:27,278
Surrounded by your Voltron, and
your Bernadette and your me.

375
00:30:27,371 --> 00:30:32,376
Listen, we both know
that cancer is a shit show.

376
00:30:32,382 --> 00:30:34,523
Like a jack-off, Smirnoff,

377
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:39,797
opening for the spin doctors at
the Iowa state fair shit show.

378
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:46,596
And under no circumstances
will I take you, to that show.

379
00:30:46,697 --> 00:30:51,601
I want you to remember me.
Not the "ghost of Christmas" me.

380
00:30:51,702 --> 00:30:53,302
I wanna remember us!

381
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:54,593
I swear to God,

382
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:58,701
I'll find you in the next life and boom
box Careless Whisper outside your window.

383
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,733
WHAM!

384
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:06,416
No one is boom
boxing shit. Okay?

385
00:31:09,219 --> 00:31:11,421
We can fight this.

386
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,900
Besides, I just realized something.

387
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,800
You win.

388
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,200
Your life is officially way more fucked up than mine

389
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,000
I love you!

390
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,502
Wade.

391
00:31:41,752 --> 00:31:42,954
Wease.

392
00:31:42,963 --> 00:31:45,417
You look like you need a
blowjob and a shower.

393
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:47,773
Little courtesy calls
for the latter, first.

394
00:31:47,857 --> 00:31:49,677
How about three shots of patron.

395
00:31:49,686 --> 00:31:52,271
Or, how about,
Triticum aestivum?

396
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:54,786
Wheatgrass. Excellent
for the immune system.

397
00:31:54,795 --> 00:31:56,775
Jesus Christ, you
sound like Vanessa.

398
00:31:56,866 --> 00:31:57,894
Here, check it out.

399
00:31:57,903 --> 00:32:00,878
She's sending away for all these
colorful clinic brochures.

400
00:32:01,272 --> 00:32:03,873
I'm sure they're
all FDA approved.

401
00:32:03,975 --> 00:32:07,144
Chechnya? Isn't that where
you go to get cancer?

402
00:32:07,153 --> 00:32:09,487
We got China and Central Mexico.

403
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:12,202
You know how they say
cancer in Spanish?

404
00:32:12,211 --> 00:32:13,391
No.

405
00:32:13,784 --> 00:32:16,787
- "El cancer."
- I could've guessed that.

406
00:32:17,788 --> 00:32:19,155
Look how happy you look here.

407
00:32:19,164 --> 00:32:21,800
You mind if I keep this, put
it up, so I can remember?

408
00:32:21,891 --> 00:32:23,286
When you looked alive.

409
00:32:23,295 --> 00:32:26,011
At least now I'm gonna
win the dead pool.

410
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,807
Now that you'll die,
tragically, of cancer.

411
00:32:28,898 --> 00:32:30,301
I got it, thanks.

412
00:32:33,304 --> 00:32:37,808
That guy over there came in looking
for you. Real grim reaper type.

413
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:40,811
I don't know. Might
further the plot.

414
00:32:44,414 --> 00:32:46,817
- Booth.
- Wade.

415
00:32:52,222 --> 00:32:53,324
Mr. Wilson.

416
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:54,959
How can I help you, besides

417
00:32:54,968 --> 00:32:57,243
luring children into a panel van?

418
00:32:57,328 --> 00:32:59,936
I understand you've recently been
diagnosed with terminal cancer.

419
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:02,139
Stalker alert!

420
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:04,285
It's my job. Recruitment.

421
00:33:04,595 --> 00:33:07,953
I'm sorry you've had
such a tough go.

422
00:33:08,438 --> 00:33:09,717
But you're a fighter.

423
00:33:09,926 --> 00:33:13,076
Special Forces. 41 confirmed kills.

424
00:33:13,287 --> 00:33:17,254
1 every 7 weeks. Same rate
most folks get a haircut.

425
00:33:18,348 --> 00:33:19,782
This should wash the taste down.

426
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:22,660
It's tough to forget
being so impressive.

427
00:33:23,152 --> 00:33:26,975
And now you spend your days
sticking up for the little people.

428
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,966
People change. What do you want?

429
00:33:29,158 --> 00:33:33,863
I represent an organization
that may be able to help.

430
00:33:34,062 --> 00:33:38,567
What if I told you we
can cure your cancer?

431
00:33:38,567 --> 00:33:42,821
And what's more, give you
abilities most men only dream of.

432
00:33:46,376 --> 00:33:48,478
I'd say that you sound like
an infomercial. But...

433
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:51,754
Not a good one, like
Slapchop, more Shakeweighty.

434
00:33:51,955 --> 00:33:56,960
The world needs extraordinary soldiers.
We won't just make you better.

435
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,762
We will make you
better than better.

436
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:02,941
A superhero.

437
00:34:02,966 --> 00:34:05,476
Look, Agent Smith,

438
00:34:05,485 --> 00:34:08,002
I tried the hero business
and it left a mark.

439
00:34:08,071 --> 00:34:10,974
But if I ever hit fuck-
it, I'll look you up.

440
00:34:11,975 --> 00:34:13,776
Oh. Shit.

441
00:34:13,977 --> 00:34:17,981
We're within 500 yards of the school.
So you may wanna, you know...

442
00:34:20,984 --> 00:34:22,986
His drink's on him.

443
00:34:27,991 --> 00:34:29,993
What'd he say?

444
00:34:52,636 --> 00:34:54,055
Hey, what's going on?

445
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:59,755
Hey, sorry. I had a
Liam Neeson nightmare.

446
00:35:00,756 --> 00:35:04,060
I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter
and he just wasn't having it.

447
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,072
They made 3 of those movies.

448
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:20,076
At some point, you'd have to
wonder if he's just a bad parent.

449
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:37,393
The worst part about cancer
isn't what it does to you.

450
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,096
But what it does to
the people you love.

451
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,637
Who knew if this guy
could save my life?

452
00:35:44,646 --> 00:35:48,111
But I knew there's only one
way that I could save hers.

453
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,700
Isn't that what superheroes do?

454
00:36:05,515 --> 00:36:09,519
Okay. Let's pro/con
this superhero thing.

455
00:36:11,521 --> 00:36:14,835
Pro: they pull down
a gaggle of ass,

456
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:17,135
local dry cleaning discounts,
lucrative film deals,

457
00:36:17,228 --> 00:36:20,231
both origin stories and larger,
ensemble team movies.

458
00:36:20,231 --> 00:36:23,334
Con: they're all lame-
ass teacher's pets!

459
00:36:23,335 --> 00:36:25,332
You know I can hear you.

460
00:36:25,341 --> 00:36:28,447
Wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to them.

461
00:36:28,538 --> 00:36:29,843
Stay right here.

462
00:36:29,852 --> 00:36:32,942
You've been warned
before, Deadpool.

463
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:36,499
This is a shameful and
reckless use of your powers.

464
00:36:36,508 --> 00:36:38,546
You will both be coming with us.

465
00:36:38,548 --> 00:36:43,072
Look Colossus, I don't have time for the
goody two-tissues bullshit right now.

466
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:44,762
And you are?

467
00:36:45,856 --> 00:36:47,858
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

468
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:51,461
Negasonic Teenage...
What the shit?!

469
00:36:51,662 --> 00:36:53,865
That's the coolest name ever!

470
00:36:54,865 --> 00:36:58,869
- So what, you're like his sidekick?
- No. Trainee.

471
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:03,232
Let me guess, X-Men left you
behind on what, shit detail?

472
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:04,782
What does that make you?

473
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:08,077
Pretending you're not here, Negasonic
Teenage Warhead. Can we trade names?

474
00:37:08,578 --> 00:37:11,979
- Can we go?
- "Look! I'm a teenage girl!"

475
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:13,913
"I'd rather be anywhere than here.

476
00:37:13,922 --> 00:37:18,253
I'm all about long, sullen silences,
followed by mean comments,

477
00:37:18,262 --> 00:37:20,205
followed by more silences."

478
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,085
So what's it gonna be? huh?

479
00:37:22,094 --> 00:37:25,903
Long, sullen silence?
Or mean comment? Go on.

480
00:37:27,898 --> 00:37:29,485
You got me in a box here.

481
00:37:29,494 --> 00:37:33,712
We can't allow this, Deadpool.
Please, come quietly.

482
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:36,907
- You big, chrome cockgobbler!
- That's not nice.

483
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:39,910
You really got to fuck
this up for me? Trust me...

484
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:45,916
That wheezing bag of dick-tits
has it coming! He's pure evil!

485
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:49,920
Besides, nobody's getting hurt.

486
00:37:54,925 --> 00:37:57,627
That guy was already
up there when I got here.

487
00:37:57,627 --> 00:38:00,047
Wade, you are better than this.

488
00:38:00,056 --> 00:38:03,267
Join us, use your
powers for good.

489
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:05,098
- Heads up!
- Be a superhero.

490
00:38:05,107 --> 00:38:09,347
- Listen! The day I decide to be
a crime-fighting shit-swizzler,

491
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,467
who rooms with a bunch
of other little whiners,

492
00:38:11,476 --> 00:38:13,493
at the Neverland Mansion
of some creepy,

493
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:17,171
old, bald, heaven's gate
looking motherfucker,

494
00:38:17,248 --> 00:38:18,347
on that day!,

495
00:38:18,356 --> 00:38:21,348
I'll send your shiny, happy
ass a friend request.

496
00:38:21,348 --> 00:38:24,062
But until then, I'm gonna
do what I came here to do.

497
00:38:24,153 --> 00:38:26,754
Either that, or slap
the bitch out of you!

498
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:28,077
- Wade...
- Hey.

499
00:38:28,086 --> 00:38:30,168
- Zip it, Sinead!
- Hey, Douchepool!

500
00:38:30,761 --> 00:38:32,963
And I hope you're watching...

501
00:38:35,966 --> 00:38:37,968
Quite unfortunate.

502
00:38:40,971 --> 00:38:43,974
That does it!

503
00:38:46,977 --> 00:38:48,979
Canada!

504
00:38:50,481 --> 00:38:53,984
- That's not good. Cock shot!
- Wade, please.

505
00:38:54,985 --> 00:38:57,988
Oh, your poor wife!

506
00:38:58,087 --> 00:38:59,990
You really should stop.

507
00:39:02,293 --> 00:39:05,396
All the dinosaurs
feared the T-Rex.

508
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:11,552
I promise this gets
worse for you, big boy!

509
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:13,010
This is embarassing.

510
00:39:14,004 --> 00:39:16,006
Please. Stay down.

511
00:39:17,007 --> 00:39:19,709
Did you ever hear of the one-legged
man in the ass-kicking contest?

512
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:20,906
Do you have 'off' switch?

513
00:39:20,915 --> 00:39:23,822
Yeah, it's right next to the prostate.
Or is that the 'on' switch?

514
00:39:24,014 --> 00:39:25,316
Enough!

515
00:39:34,024 --> 00:39:36,026
Let us go talk to the Professor.

516
00:39:37,027 --> 00:39:41,631
McAvoy or Stewart? These
timelines are so confusing...

517
00:39:42,032 --> 00:39:47,438
- Dead or alive, you're coming with me!
- You will recover, Wade. You always do.

518
00:39:53,043 --> 00:39:56,046
Did you ever see "127 Hours"?
Spoiler alert!

519
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:03,053
Oh my God. Nasty.

520
00:40:05,055 --> 00:40:11,061
Oh, there's the money shot, baby. Are
you there, God? It's me, Margaret.

521
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:23,474
Rock, meet bottom.

522
00:40:24,074 --> 00:40:26,975
When life ends up
breathtakingly fucked,

523
00:40:26,984 --> 00:40:31,088
you can generally trace it
back to one big, bad decision.

524
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,084
The one that sent you
down the road to Shitsburg.

525
00:40:34,183 --> 00:40:37,087
This, well, this was mine.

526
00:40:38,088 --> 00:40:44,094
Mr. Wilson. Nothing warms my heart
more than a change of someone else's.

527
00:40:45,095 --> 00:40:48,098
You've finally hit fuck-it.

528
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:50,778
Just promise you'll do right by me.

529
00:40:50,787 --> 00:40:53,212
So I can do right by someone else.

530
00:40:53,221 --> 00:40:54,420
Of course.

531
00:40:55,105 --> 00:41:00,110
And please don't make the
super-suit green. Or animated!

532
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:25,135
This place seems sanitary.
My first request is warmer hands.

533
00:41:25,235 --> 00:41:29,139
And Jesus! A warmer table.

534
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,276
You should really come up
with a safe word, fellas.

535
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:35,152
I'm thinking 'pork and beans'.

536
00:41:37,622 --> 00:41:39,624
Easy!

537
00:41:42,227 --> 00:41:44,070
Aren't you a little strong for a lady?

538
00:41:45,048 --> 00:41:48,051
I'm calling Wang.

539
00:41:50,053 --> 00:41:55,058
What's up with the matches?
Oral fixation? Or just a big Stallone fan?

540
00:41:56,059 --> 00:41:58,475
Patience, Angel.
All in good time.

541
00:41:58,484 --> 00:42:02,072
Are you here for the turn
down service or what?

542
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:04,387
We have another talker.

543
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,923
I'm just excited about my
first day at superhero camp.

544
00:42:07,015 --> 00:42:09,032
Shut the fuck up.

545
00:42:12,075 --> 00:42:17,080
Mr. Wilson, my name's
Ajax. I manage this workshop.

546
00:42:18,182 --> 00:42:21,082
All of my welcome speeches used
to be filled with euphemisms like,

547
00:42:21,084 --> 00:42:25,088
"this may hurt a little," or
"this might cause you some discomfort."

548
00:42:25,189 --> 00:42:26,631
But I'm going blunt.

549
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,093
This workshop is not a
government-led program.

550
00:42:30,093 --> 00:42:32,947
It's a private institution that
turns reclamation projects

551
00:42:32,956 --> 00:42:34,406
like yourself into men of....

552
00:42:35,098 --> 00:42:38,101
Extraordinary abilities.

553
00:42:39,102 --> 00:42:43,106
But if you think superhuman
powers are acquired painlessly...

554
00:42:43,115 --> 00:42:44,216
Wrong.

555
00:42:44,608 --> 00:42:46,109
I'm injecting you with a serum

556
00:42:46,118 --> 00:42:48,820
that activates any mutant
genes lurking in your DNA.

557
00:42:49,012 --> 00:42:54,117
For it to work, we need to
subject you to extreme stress.

558
00:42:58,121 --> 00:43:02,125
You've heard the whole, "make an
omelet, break some eggs" bit, I hope.

559
00:43:02,526 --> 00:43:07,130
I'm about to hurt you, Wade. I was
a patient here once myself, you know.

560
00:43:08,131 --> 00:43:13,136
The treatment affects everyone differently.
It made Angel inhumanly strong.

561
00:43:14,137 --> 00:43:17,013
In my case, it
enhanced my reflexes,

562
00:43:17,022 --> 00:43:21,453
also scorched my nerve endings
so I no longer feel pain.

563
00:43:23,146 --> 00:43:26,751
And in fact, I no
longer feel anything.

564
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:40,163
Thank... thank you! You
have something in your teeth.

565
00:43:41,164 --> 00:43:46,169
Right in the middle there, just...
Nugget of romaine lettuce or something.

566
00:43:48,171 --> 00:43:50,173
It's been bothering
me for a long time.

567
00:43:52,175 --> 00:43:55,120
Made you look. Hey, is
Ajax your actual name,

568
00:43:55,129 --> 00:43:57,690
because it sounds
suspiciously made up.

569
00:43:57,782 --> 00:44:05,390
What is it really? Kevin? Bruce? Scott?
Mitch? Rickster? Is it Basil Fawlty?

570
00:44:05,498 --> 00:44:10,093
Joke away. One thing that never survives
this place is a sense of humor.

571
00:44:10,193 --> 00:44:13,197
- We'll see about that.
- I suppose we will.

572
00:44:14,198 --> 00:44:15,599
He's all yours.

573
00:44:15,608 --> 00:44:21,214
C'mon. You're gonna leave me all alone
here with less angry Rosie O'Donnell?

574
00:44:25,209 --> 00:44:27,332
This is how it's going to work.

575
00:44:27,341 --> 00:44:30,663
Adrenaline acts as a
catalyst for the serum, so

576
00:44:30,672 --> 00:44:33,233
we're gonna have to
make you suffer.

577
00:44:34,218 --> 00:44:38,729
If you're lucky, your mutant genes
will activate and manifest in a

578
00:44:38,738 --> 00:44:40,733
spectacular fashion.

579
00:44:44,228 --> 00:44:47,231
If not, well, we'll have
to keep on hurting you.

580
00:44:48,232 --> 00:44:52,236
In new and different ways,
each more painful than the last.

581
00:44:54,238 --> 00:44:57,241
Until you finally mutate...

582
00:44:58,242 --> 00:45:00,195
or die.

583
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:08,137
You mean like a bucket list?

584
00:45:08,146 --> 00:45:13,266
Like a fuck it list, I'd like to
light a spiff off the Olympic torch.

585
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:15,860
Acid to me, right after.

586
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:22,266
Let's not forget: naked tandem base-jumping
with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs.

587
00:45:22,367 --> 00:45:25,269
Anything on my bucket list
would involve public nudity.

588
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:29,273
Finally, giving Meredith
Baxter Birney a dutch oven.

589
00:45:29,374 --> 00:45:32,877
No, receiving a dutch oven
from Meredith Baxter Birney.

590
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,284
Making banana
pancakes... For my kids...

591
00:45:43,687 --> 00:45:46,290
Vanessa...

592
00:45:49,293 --> 00:45:52,296
I wanna see Vanessa.

593
00:45:52,397 --> 00:45:56,300
Oh, lovely. I don't know about
anyone else but, I'm touched.

594
00:45:56,401 --> 00:45:58,202
We're just joking.

595
00:45:58,211 --> 00:46:03,316
No, no. It's okay. I
encourage distractions.

596
00:46:03,408 --> 00:46:06,308
Wouldn't want you giving
up on us now, would we?

597
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:10,314
Hey, don't take any shit from him,
Cunningham. How tough can he be...

598
00:46:11,315 --> 00:46:15,319
- ... with a name like Francis?
- Francis?

599
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:21,325
It's his legal name. He
got Ajax from a dish soap.

600
00:46:23,327 --> 00:46:28,332
F-R-A-N-C-I... oops!

601
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:34,338
Snagged the dry cleaning
tag off your lab coat.

602
00:46:34,439 --> 00:46:38,342
FYI, I can probably get
you a superhero discount.

603
00:46:38,443 --> 00:46:42,346
- You are so relentlessly annoying.
- Thanks. Never heard that before.

604
00:46:42,447 --> 00:46:45,390
Why don't you do us all a
favor and shut the fuck up?

605
00:46:45,398 --> 00:46:47,360
Or I'll sew your
pretty mouth shut.

606
00:46:47,452 --> 00:46:51,255
Oh, I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

607
00:46:51,355 --> 00:46:54,474
See, here's the problem with
round-the-clock torture,

608
00:46:54,483 --> 00:46:57,370
it's that you can't really
step it up from there.

609
00:46:59,363 --> 00:47:02,366
Is that what you think?

610
00:47:07,371 --> 00:47:12,076
If this doesn't unlock your
mutation, then, well, nothing will.

611
00:47:12,376 --> 00:47:15,685
What we're gonna do is lower the
oxygen concentration in the air

612
00:47:15,694 --> 00:47:18,391
to the exact point you feel
like you're suffocating.

613
00:47:18,483 --> 00:47:22,556
If your brain wave's slow meaning
you're about to pass out,

614
00:47:22,565 --> 00:47:24,397
then we'll turn up the O2.

615
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:28,059
If your heart rate slows meaning
you're able to catch your breath,

616
00:47:28,068 --> 00:47:29,402
we'll turn it back down.

617
00:47:30,394 --> 00:47:34,398
And that's where we'll
leave you. Right there.

618
00:47:35,399 --> 00:47:39,403
- I thought you guys were dicks before...
- You know the funniest part of this?

619
00:47:40,404 --> 00:47:43,407
You still think we're
making you a superhero.

620
00:47:43,508 --> 00:47:50,214
You? A dishonorable discharge?
Hip deep in hookers?

621
00:47:50,414 --> 00:47:55,419
You're nothing. A little secret, Wade...

622
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,423
This workshop doesn't make
superheroes, we make superslaves.

623
00:48:00,424 --> 00:48:05,429
We're gonna fit you with a control collar
and auction you off to the highest bidder.

624
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:07,639
And that's what they'll
have you doing.

625
00:48:07,648 --> 00:48:10,443
Terrorizing citizens, putting
down freedom fighters.

626
00:48:12,436 --> 00:48:15,439
Maybe just mow
the occasional lawn.

627
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,442
What the fuck is wrong with you?

628
00:48:23,447 --> 00:48:29,153
You're never going home after
this. Now there's a brave face.

629
00:48:29,453 --> 00:48:32,456
Wait, wait, wait...

630
00:48:33,457 --> 00:48:38,462
Seriously, you actually have
something in your teeth now.

631
00:48:39,463 --> 00:48:45,469
- Enjoy your weekend.
- Weekend? Back up, weekend?

632
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:31,515
Did I say this was a love
story? No. It's a horror movie.

633
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:52,536
Fucking hell! Looks like someone
lost a shot at homecoming king.

634
00:49:52,637 --> 00:49:54,055
What have you done to me?

635
00:49:54,064 --> 00:49:58,551
I've mainly raised your stress levels
high enough to trigger a mutation.

636
00:49:58,643 --> 00:50:03,547
- You sadistic fuck!
- I've cured you, Wade.

637
00:50:03,648 --> 00:50:06,499
Now your mutated cells
can heal anything.

638
00:50:06,508 --> 00:50:09,562
Striking your cancer as
fast as it can form.

639
00:50:10,554 --> 00:50:15,559
Yeah, I've seen some other side
effects before... I could cure them.

640
00:50:18,562 --> 00:50:20,564
But where's the fun in that?

641
00:50:22,566 --> 00:50:25,569
Now I'm gonna shut
you in again, Wade.

642
00:50:27,061 --> 00:50:30,574
Not because I need to.

643
00:50:33,577 --> 00:50:35,579
Because I want to.

644
00:50:49,593 --> 00:50:52,596
Farewell. Go ahead.

645
00:50:54,598 --> 00:50:57,601
Ugh. You smell like shit.

646
00:51:00,604 --> 00:51:04,608
- Motherfucker...
- That's alright, it's alright...

647
00:51:04,709 --> 00:51:11,615
I think we have earned that one.
You take off. Go on, off you go.

648
00:51:22,626 --> 00:51:24,628
Quick question:

649
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:28,632
What's my name?

650
00:51:33,637 --> 00:51:36,640
Didn't think so.

651
00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:40,644
Sorry, Francis. My lips are sealed.

652
00:53:36,321 --> 00:53:40,764
You don't wanna kill me. I'm the
only one who can fix your ugly mug!

653
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:38,822
What's my name?

654
00:54:44,828 --> 00:54:46,830
Wade...

655
00:55:52,896 --> 00:56:00,904
I didn't just get the cure to el cancer...
I got the cure to el everything.

656
00:56:03,907 --> 00:56:08,912
But there was only one
thing that really mattered.

657
00:57:30,393 --> 00:57:34,098
No way. I'm not making
her life as ugly as mine.

658
00:57:34,297 --> 00:57:39,402
- Come on, Wade, it can't be that bad.
- Bullshit! I'm a monster inside now.

659
00:57:39,503 --> 00:57:43,107
- I belong in a fucking circus.
- Wade, Vanessa loves you.

660
00:57:43,306 --> 00:57:46,409
- She doesn't care what you... Oh!
- Do you like what you see?

661
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:53,216
No. You look like an avocado had sex
with an older, more disgusting avocado.

662
00:57:53,416 --> 00:57:55,343
Not gently. He was hate-fucking.

663
00:57:55,352 --> 00:57:58,272
There was something wrong
with the relationship

664
00:57:58,281 --> 00:58:01,440
and that was their only
catharsis without violence.

665
00:58:01,525 --> 00:58:05,807
And the only guy who can fix this
fugly mug is the British shitstick

666
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:09,040
who ran the mutant factory.
And he's gone... Poof!

667
00:58:09,232 --> 00:58:10,787
You gotta do something
to remedy this.

668
00:58:10,796 --> 00:58:12,945
'Cause as of now, you only
have one course of action:

669
00:58:13,436 --> 00:58:17,041
- Damn straight. Find Francis.
- Star in horror films.

670
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:20,243
- What?
- Star in your own horror films.

671
00:58:20,343 --> 00:58:23,947
'Cause you look like Freddy Krueger face-
fucked a topographical map of Utah.

672
00:58:24,848 --> 00:58:26,249
Here's what I'm
actually gonna do:

673
00:58:26,349 --> 00:58:29,590
I'm gonna work thru his crew
until somebody gives up Francis,

674
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:33,465
force him to fix this, put a bullet
in his skull, and fuck the brainhole.

675
00:58:33,557 --> 00:58:36,459
I don't wanna see that,
or think of it again. But,

676
00:58:36,561 --> 00:58:38,882
the douchebag does think
you're dead, right?

677
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:39,892
Yeah.

678
00:58:39,963 --> 00:58:42,095
That's good. You should
keep it that way.

679
00:58:42,104 --> 00:58:43,568
What, like, wear a mask?

680
00:58:43,568 --> 00:58:50,473
Yes, a very thick mask. All the
time. I'm sorry, you're haunting.

681
00:58:50,575 --> 00:58:54,178
- Your face is the stuff of nightmares.
- Like a testicle with teeth.

682
00:58:54,277 --> 00:59:00,483
You will die alone. I mean if you
could die. Ideally. For others' sake.

683
00:59:00,585 --> 00:59:01,566
That'll do.

684
00:59:01,575 --> 00:59:05,497
What you need now is a suit and a
nickname, like Wade the Wisecracker...

685
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:11,115
or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie.
Oh, shit.

686
00:59:11,124 --> 00:59:12,504
What?

687
00:59:13,496 --> 00:59:17,500
I put all my money on you, and now I just
realized I'm never gonna win the....

688
00:59:17,509 --> 00:59:18,610
Deadpool...

689
00:59:21,504 --> 00:59:24,507
Captain Deadpool.

690
00:59:25,508 --> 00:59:28,511
No. Just-just Deadpool. Yeah.

691
00:59:28,613 --> 00:59:30,533
To you, Mr. Pool.

692
00:59:30,542 --> 00:59:34,927
Deadpool. That sounds
like a fuckin' franchise.

693
00:59:38,152 --> 00:59:40,154
(Deadpool)

694
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:44,182
(Deadpool)

695
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:47,531
(Deadpool)

696
00:59:48,531 --> 00:59:50,533
This shit's gonna
have nuts in it!

697
00:59:51,665 --> 00:59:52,641
They call me Deadpool, I'm hella fast

698
00:59:52,641 --> 00:59:54,643
Where's Francis?

699
00:59:54,668 --> 00:59:56,169
Came to merc the bad guys, and get some ass

700
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:57,293
Got blades for days, got guns galore

701
00:59:57,317 --> 00:59:59,319
Got combo moves, evades and more

702
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:09,182
Where is Francis?

703
01:00:09,206 --> 01:00:11,208
Run away, you know that I'll chase

704
01:00:11,231 --> 01:00:12,332
Every bad guy, put them
right in their place

705
01:00:12,357 --> 01:00:14,258
Revenge, im gonna give you a taste

706
01:00:14,283 --> 01:00:16,184
I'm sexy as hell, but I cover my face

707
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:23,567
Seltzer water and lemon for
blood. Or wear red. Dumbass!

708
01:00:25,198 --> 01:00:29,202
Captain Deadpool (Nah, just Deadpool)

709
01:00:29,226 --> 01:00:31,228
Merc with a mouth, I can't die

710
01:00:31,251 --> 01:00:33,253
One foot in the grave
But I'm still alive

711
01:00:33,277 --> 01:00:35,279
Try to kill me, I'll just revive

712
01:00:35,304 --> 01:00:37,346
Then I'll put another bullet
right between your eyes

713
01:00:41,585 --> 01:00:43,587
Don't make me ask twice.

714
01:00:44,588 --> 01:00:47,591
Where is Francis?

715
01:00:47,692 --> 01:00:52,596
He made me ask twice.
Is the mask muffling my voice?

716
01:00:53,727 --> 01:00:56,229
I'm bout to take you all
to school with guns and knives

717
01:00:56,253 --> 01:00:58,229
(Deadpool)

718
01:00:58,231 --> 01:01:00,233
Where's Francis?

719
01:01:01,759 --> 01:01:03,761
Where's fucking Francis?

720
01:01:11,615 --> 01:01:14,618
You're about to be
killed by a Zamboni!

721
01:01:14,748 --> 01:01:16,750
Where's Francis?

722
01:01:17,621 --> 01:01:22,626
- No, please...
- Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

723
01:01:23,627 --> 01:01:26,630
Little spider-monkey!

724
01:01:28,762 --> 01:01:30,764
Where is...

725
01:01:30,766 --> 01:01:32,768
Francis?

726
01:01:33,637 --> 01:01:35,038
This is confusing!

727
01:01:35,047 --> 01:01:40,653
Is it sexist to hit you, is it more sexist
to not hit you, the line gets real blurry!

728
01:01:40,745 --> 01:01:42,646
Donde esta Francesca?

729
01:01:43,647 --> 01:01:49,653
Tell me where your fucking boss is!
Or you're gonna die! In 5 minutes!

730
01:01:49,783 --> 01:01:51,785
♪ Sexy motherfucka ♪

731
01:01:53,811 --> 01:01:55,813
♪ Sexy motherfucka ♪

732
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:23,687
Nice to see you, Jared. I'll
take a foot long. Fully loaded.

733
01:02:38,702 --> 01:02:43,558
41 confirmed kills. Now,
it's 89, about to be 90.

734
01:02:43,567 --> 01:02:45,217
Mr. Wilson?

735
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:51,715
- You're looking very alive.
- Hah! Only on the outside.

736
01:02:51,816 --> 01:02:54,718
- This is not going to end...
- This is not gonna end well for you, no.

737
01:02:54,819 --> 01:02:57,721
- Where's your boss?
- I can tell you exactly where...

738
01:02:58,722 --> 01:03:00,620
Oh you'll tell me. But first,

739
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:05,738
you might wanna look away for this.
Now this little piggy went to...

740
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,232
Thank you, Agent Smith.

741
01:03:12,736 --> 01:03:14,738
Taxi!

742
01:03:15,739 --> 01:03:18,742
Hop in! Great day for a ride.

743
01:03:19,743 --> 01:03:21,745
And we all know
how this turned out.

744
01:03:24,748 --> 01:03:26,750
Whoops! You weren't
meant to see that.

745
01:03:33,757 --> 01:03:36,757
There. All caught up.

746
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,800
We're here!

747
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:51,274
Sorry! About bleeding
at all your garbage.

748
01:03:56,279 --> 01:03:59,282
Seltzer water and
lemon for blood.

749
01:03:59,306 --> 01:04:00,483
Whoooo!

750
01:04:01,284 --> 01:04:03,888
Some kinds of anger
can't be managed.

751
01:04:03,988 --> 01:04:07,983
Like the kind where your year-long
plan ends with the wrong guy

752
01:04:07,992 --> 01:04:09,301
getting dismembered!

753
01:04:09,393 --> 01:04:14,297
That said, when it comes time to licking
wounds, there's no place like home.

754
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:16,121
Ah, and I share that home with
someone you've met.

755
01:04:16,145 --> 01:04:18,545
The old blind lady from
the laundromat, Al.

756
01:04:19,069 --> 01:04:21,069
God, I miss cocaine!

757
01:04:21,093 --> 01:04:22,993
Her. Ohhhh!...

758
01:04:23,017 --> 01:04:26,017
4th-wall break inside
a 4th-wall break.

759
01:04:26,041 --> 01:04:29,041
That's like...16 walls.

760
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,700
She's like Robin to my Batman
except she's old...and black.

761
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:35,790
and blind...and I think she's
in love with me.

762
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Wait, pretty sure Robin
loves Batman too.

763
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,200
Al?

764
01:04:52,836 --> 01:04:54,838
Morning, sleepyhead.

765
01:04:55,839 --> 01:05:00,545
- It smells like old lady pants in here.
- Yes I'm old, I wear pants.

766
01:05:00,644 --> 01:05:03,847
But you're no lady.
Oh, so comfy.

767
01:05:05,849 --> 01:05:08,293
Upside of being blind, I've
never seen you in crocs.

768
01:05:08,302 --> 01:05:10,562
You mean my big, rubber,
masturbating shoes?

769
01:05:10,654 --> 01:05:16,860
Yes I know. Downside of being blind,
I hear everything in this duplex.

770
01:05:18,762 --> 01:05:21,865
- Sit on a stick.
- Bactine?

771
01:05:22,866 --> 01:05:24,868
Bactine should do it.

772
01:05:25,869 --> 01:05:30,874
How's that kyuna coming along? Ikea
doesn't assemble itself, you know.

773
01:05:30,975 --> 01:05:35,877
You're telling me. I don't mind the kyuna.
It's an improvement on the Hurdal.

774
01:05:35,879 --> 01:05:38,482
Anything's an improvement over the Hurdal.

775
01:05:38,882 --> 01:05:41,885
I'd taken an Hemnes or
a Trysil over the Hurdal.

776
01:05:43,887 --> 01:05:45,689
No, I didn't get
excited 'till I saw kyuna.

777
01:05:45,889 --> 01:05:46,850
Screw, please.

778
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:49,701
Here? Now? Just kidding. I
know it's been decades.

779
01:05:49,793 --> 01:05:52,896
- You'd be surprised.
- Pretty grossed out.

780
01:05:53,897 --> 01:05:56,900
Ta... dah...

781
01:06:02,687 --> 01:06:05,909
I wish I never heard, of Craigslist.

782
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:09,024
And I quote, "Looking for roommate,
blind, and likes imperfections.

783
01:06:09,033 --> 01:06:12,624
Must be good with hands." Or would you
rather I build the Ikea and you pay rent?

784
01:06:12,716 --> 01:06:15,919
- Why such a douche this morning?
- Let's recap:

785
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:20,524
The cock-fizzle that turned me into this
freak slipped through my arms today.

786
01:06:21,925 --> 01:06:23,026
Arm.

787
01:06:23,725 --> 01:06:26,795
Catching him was my only chance to be
hot again, get my super-sexy ex back

788
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,990
and prevent this from
happening to someone else.

789
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:32,664
So yeah, today was about as
much fun as a sandpaper dildo.

790
01:06:34,336 --> 01:06:36,139
Hash tag drive-by.

791
01:06:54,157 --> 01:06:57,160
Found out who our
friend in the red suit is.

792
01:06:58,161 --> 01:07:04,167
Fucking Wade Wilson. Suppose I'd wear
a mask, too, if I had a face like that.

793
01:07:04,266 --> 01:07:06,169
I only wish I'd heal the same.

794
01:07:09,771 --> 01:07:13,176
Still, we'll put him out of
our misery. On our terms.

795
01:07:14,177 --> 01:07:15,942
Right. And when he heals?

796
01:07:15,951 --> 01:07:20,190
He can't. Not if there's
nothing left of him to heal.

797
01:07:20,282 --> 01:07:25,188
You know, it's funny. I
almost missed the fucker.

798
01:07:26,189 --> 01:07:32,494
I like a challenge. But he's bad
for business. Now let's go find him.

799
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,101
Tylenol PM?

800
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:41,211
It sticks back where
you stuck the Bactine.

801
01:07:41,303 --> 01:07:44,870
I raided my stash of
wisdom just to take a sec

802
01:07:44,879 --> 01:07:48,218
and I am orbiting fucking
Saturn right now.

803
01:07:50,812 --> 01:07:53,216
But I appreciate the gesture.

804
01:07:54,217 --> 01:07:58,221
Am I crazy? Or is
your hand really small?

805
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:01,224
About the size of a KFC spork.

806
01:08:02,225 --> 01:08:03,657
I get why you're so pissy,

807
01:08:03,666 --> 01:08:05,752
but your mood's never
gonna brighten

808
01:08:05,761 --> 01:08:08,746
'till you find this woman
and tell her how you feel.

809
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,971
What do I keep telling
you, Mrs. McGoo?

810
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:14,244
She wouldn't have me. If you
could see me, you'd understand.

811
01:08:14,337 --> 01:08:15,595
Looks aren't everything.

812
01:08:15,604 --> 01:08:18,748
Looks are everything! Ever
heard David Beckham speak?

813
01:08:18,841 --> 01:08:21,138
It's like he mouth-sexed
a can of helium.

814
01:08:21,147 --> 01:08:24,754
You think Ryan Reynolds got this
far on a superior acting method?

815
01:08:24,847 --> 01:08:26,749
- Love is blind, Wade.
- No...

816
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:29,252
You're blind.

817
01:08:29,352 --> 01:08:32,255
So you're just gonna
lie there and whimper?

818
01:08:32,355 --> 01:08:35,012
No, I'm gonna wait 'till this
arm plows through puberty

819
01:08:35,021 --> 01:08:37,868
and then I'll come up with a
whole, new Christmas day plan.

820
01:08:38,061 --> 01:08:43,266
In the meantime, you might wanna leave
the room. I bet it feels huge in this hand.

821
01:08:44,267 --> 01:08:47,270
Go, go, go, go, go...

822
01:08:48,271 --> 01:08:51,301
So the doctor says, the bad news is
you don't have that long to live.

823
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:53,084
So the patient says,
how long do I have?

824
01:08:53,175 --> 01:08:56,279
The doctor says, five.
The guy says, five what?

825
01:08:56,379 --> 01:09:00,283
The doctor says, 4, 3, 2...

826
01:09:06,289 --> 01:09:08,891
Can I help you ladies?

827
01:09:11,294 --> 01:09:13,296
Oh, I do hope so.

828
01:09:16,299 --> 01:09:21,304
Now, I heard you might be able to point
me in the direction of a, a friend of mine.

829
01:09:21,404 --> 01:09:23,306
Name of Wade Wilson.

830
01:09:24,307 --> 01:09:27,310
Sorry, I don't know the name.

831
01:09:34,317 --> 01:09:37,189
Hey, you're not supposed
to be behind the bar.

832
01:09:40,323 --> 01:09:41,606
I've seen this girl.

833
01:09:41,615 --> 01:09:45,335
This must be Vanessa. I've
heard so much about you.

834
01:09:49,332 --> 01:09:51,469
Sweetheart, you might
wanna look around.

835
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:54,344
This isn't really the place
to do something like that.

836
01:09:55,338 --> 01:09:59,342
Easy, Angel. Put
the little man down.

837
01:10:00,343 --> 01:10:03,346
- We have everything we need now.
- You sure?

838
01:10:04,347 --> 01:10:07,350
You don't want any clothes
that are not monochromatic?

839
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:10,353
Have fun at your midnight
showing of Blade II.

840
01:10:13,356 --> 01:10:16,359
Thanks for having my back, guys.

841
01:10:20,963 --> 01:10:24,867
Wade, we have a fucking
problem, and by we, I mean you.

842
01:10:26,068 --> 01:10:31,374
I can't believe we're doing this. Is there
a word for half-afraid, half-angry?

843
01:10:31,474 --> 01:10:34,377
"Afrangry", I guess. Have you
decided what you're gonna say to her?

844
01:10:34,457 --> 01:10:39,081
- Fuck me!
- Maybe not start with that.

845
01:10:44,387 --> 01:10:50,393
Hey, coming on to our stage
right now, give it up for Chastity!

846
01:10:53,396 --> 01:10:55,325
Or as I like to call her, Irony.

847
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:58,408
I gotta find her fast,
before numb nuts does.

848
01:10:58,501 --> 01:11:03,406
- How do you know she's in here?
- Some customer stalking that fox.

849
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:30,234
Every time I see her,
it's like the first time.

850
01:11:30,734 --> 01:11:33,237
Especially from this angle.

851
01:11:56,260 --> 01:12:00,264
You can't buy love, but you
can rent it for three minutes.

852
01:12:03,267 --> 01:12:06,270
You weak motherfucker!

853
01:12:07,471 --> 01:12:08,976
C'mon.

854
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,500
C'mon get it together. this isn't 
about you, this is about Vanessa.

855
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,602
Here we go.

856
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,442
Maximum effort.

857
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,902
Vanessa!

858
01:12:29,993 --> 01:12:35,999
Someone out back asking for you.
Something about, an old boyfriend?

859
01:13:01,325 --> 01:13:06,330
I knew it was you. 'Cause
we're weird curvy edges.

860
01:13:07,331 --> 01:13:09,333
Like a jigsaw puzzle.

861
01:13:19,343 --> 01:13:22,346
You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.

862
01:13:31,354 --> 01:13:32,821
Hey, hey, where did she go?

863
01:13:32,831 --> 01:13:36,366
I saw her head to the back.
Go get her, tiger.

864
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Fuck!

865
01:14:03,785 --> 01:14:05,386
Motherfucker!

866
01:14:05,388 --> 01:14:08,191
- Wade, Wade, Wade, Wade...
- Cunt! Chocolate...

867
01:14:08,391 --> 01:14:13,396
- Jiminy... Fuck! Fuck!
- We can talk... or you can hit that...

868
01:14:18,401 --> 01:14:21,402
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Relax, relax. Okay...

869
01:14:21,404 --> 01:14:28,411
I'm gonna rip his motherfucking... find
that, find it, or I'm gonna get angry.

870
01:14:30,413 --> 01:14:34,316
Here, this is Vanessa.
No, wait, it's Francis.

871
01:14:34,417 --> 01:14:37,420
- He wants you to come to him.
- What is that?

872
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:41,113
That's the shit emoji. It's the turd
with the smiling face and the eyes.

873
01:14:41,122 --> 01:14:43,433
I thought it was chocolate
yogurt for so long.

874
01:14:43,726 --> 01:14:46,429
- I need guns.
- Okay, which ones?

875
01:14:46,529 --> 01:14:49,432
- I need all the guns!
- All right, okay.

876
01:15:08,851 --> 01:15:13,856
- That's about 3000 rounds.
- And we all know what I can do with 12.

877
01:15:14,156 --> 01:15:17,460
Hey, hey, careful with that,
Ronnie Milsap, we're downrange.

878
01:15:18,461 --> 01:15:23,466
I was gonna spend the night assembling
the () but this is holding my interest.

879
01:15:23,566 --> 01:15:26,461
- I told you, we're going
with the (), not the (),

880
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:28,879
get it thru your head
or get outta Fucktown!

881
01:15:28,888 --> 01:15:29,787
Shit.

882
01:15:29,872 --> 01:15:31,544
That's all the
pieces in the house.

883
01:15:31,554 --> 01:15:33,784
No, no, no, come on. Let's go.
Cough it up.

884
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:39,482
- Down, down, down, down.
- Fuck you.

885
01:15:40,483 --> 01:15:43,486
45 cal. I like it.

886
01:15:45,387 --> 01:15:46,489
Wade...

887
01:15:47,490 --> 01:15:51,494
I'd go with you, but...
I don't wanna.

888
01:15:53,496 --> 01:15:56,499
Oh, listen, Al...

889
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:02,505
If I never see you again, I want you
to know that I love you very much.

890
01:16:03,506 --> 01:16:04,907
And also,

891
01:16:04,916 --> 01:16:08,548
there's about 116 kilos of cocaine
buried somewhere in the apartment,

892
01:16:08,557 --> 01:16:10,528
right next to the cure for blindness.

893
01:16:10,613 --> 01:16:12,515
Good luck.

894
01:16:16,519 --> 01:16:19,522
You wanna get fucked up?

895
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:30,533
Put her down over here.

896
01:16:39,542 --> 01:16:41,544
Go on, then.

897
01:16:43,546 --> 01:16:49,552
- Thanks, dickless. And I mean you.
- You're a talker, too. You and Wade.

898
01:16:49,652 --> 01:16:52,994
I've been trying to tell you
assholes you got the wrong girl.

899
01:16:53,003 --> 01:16:54,564
My old boyfriend, he's dead.

900
01:16:54,657 --> 01:17:02,565
See, I thought that, too. But he keeps on
coming back. Like a cockroach, but uglier.

901
01:17:02,665 --> 01:17:10,073
Now, I may not feel, but he does. Let's see
how he fights with your head on the block.

902
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:21,584
- Ripley! From Alien 3!
- Fuck, you're old.

903
01:17:22,585 --> 01:17:26,139
Fake laugh! Hiding real pain!
Go get Silver balls.

904
01:17:26,148 --> 01:17:29,700
You guys going for a bite?
Early bird special?

905
01:17:29,893 --> 01:17:33,096
Like there's something wrong with eating
before sundown or saving money. No.

906
01:17:33,295 --> 01:17:37,600
You know that bad guy that
you let go? He's got my girl.

907
01:17:38,601 --> 01:17:42,355
- You're gonna help me get her back.
- Wade? Is that you?

908
01:17:42,455 --> 01:17:46,609
Yeah, it's me Deadpool, and I got
an offer that you can't refuse!

909
01:17:49,212 --> 01:17:51,214
I'm gonna wait out here,
okay? It's a big house!

910
01:17:51,313 --> 01:17:53,497
It's funny that I only ever see 2 of you.

911
01:17:53,506 --> 01:17:56,626
It's almost like, the studio
couldn't afford another X-Men.

912
01:17:58,150 --> 01:18:03,456
And that, is why in my opinion, the
movie Cocoon, is pure pornography.

913
01:18:04,457 --> 01:18:08,461
- Who brought this twinkly man?
- Twinkly, but deadly.

914
01:18:08,561 --> 01:18:12,878
My chrome-penised friend back there,
has agreed to do me this solid.

915
01:18:12,887 --> 01:18:16,577
In exchange, I said I would
consider joining his boy band.

916
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:20,471
- It's not boy band.
- Sure, it's not.

917
01:18:20,473 --> 01:18:22,508
So, any luck winning Gita back?

918
01:18:22,517 --> 01:18:25,016
I tried to hold on
tight, Mr. Pool,

919
01:18:25,025 --> 01:18:28,496
but Bandu is more craftier
and handsomer than me.

920
01:18:29,582 --> 01:18:32,485
Well, I think you're
pretty darn cute.

921
01:18:37,490 --> 01:18:39,492
- Dopinder?
- Hmm?

922
01:18:41,094 --> 01:18:49,102
- What was that?
- That was........ Bandu, in the trunk?

923
01:18:50,303 --> 01:18:53,506
- Ban-who?
- My romantic rival, Bandu.

924
01:18:53,606 --> 01:18:56,368
He's tied up in the trunk.
I'm doing as you said, DP,

925
01:18:56,377 --> 01:19:00,520
I plan to gut him like a tandoori fish
then dump his carcass on Gita's doorstep.

926
01:19:00,613 --> 01:19:05,518
I did not tell him to do that! Absolutely
not! We got lost in translation!

927
01:19:05,618 --> 01:19:09,823
Dopinder, this is no way to win Gita's
heart back! (I'm so proud of you.)

928
01:19:09,922 --> 01:19:13,225
Drop Bandu off safe
and gentle-like. (Kill him.)

929
01:19:13,326 --> 01:19:19,532
And then, win Gita back the old-fashioned
way, with your boyish charm! (Kidnap her.)

930
01:19:20,533 --> 01:19:22,535
He's super dead.

931
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:31,544
- I presume a crisp high-five?
- For you? Ten!

932
01:19:32,045 --> 01:19:36,549
Okay, guys, let's get out there and make
a difference! (You know what to do.)

933
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:39,552
Knock 'em dead, pool boy!

934
01:19:41,554 --> 01:19:44,157
Time to make the
chimi-fucking-changas.

935
01:19:45,257 --> 01:19:47,289
Not often a dude ruins your face,

936
01:19:47,298 --> 01:19:48,732
skullstomps your sanity,

937
01:19:48,741 --> 01:19:51,676
grabs your future baby mama
and personally sees to 4

938
01:19:51,685 --> 01:19:53,290
of your 5 shittiest moments.

939
01:19:54,167 --> 01:19:58,571

Goddammit! We'll do this the old-
fashioned way. With two swords...

949
01:20:43,716 --> 01:20:45,118
and maximum effort.

950
01:20:45,218 --> 01:20:47,194

What's my name?

958
01:21:06,716 --> 01:21:09,750
Ooh, I'mma fucking
spell it out for 'ya.

959
01:21:11,644 --> 01:21:12,645
Go get some.

960
01:21:12,654 --> 01:21:16,656
Superhero landing. She's gonna do
a superhero landing, wait for it!

961
01:21:20,653 --> 01:21:23,806
Superhero landing! You know,
that's really hard on your knees.

962
01:21:23,815 --> 01:21:25,665
Totally impractical,
they all do it.

963
01:21:25,758 --> 01:21:30,362
You're a lovely lady but I'm saving myself
for Francis. That's why I brought him.

964
01:21:30,513 --> 01:21:34,667
I'd prefer not to hit a
woman, so please...

965
01:21:40,673 --> 01:21:43,676
I mean, that's
why I brought her?

966
01:21:45,377 --> 01:21:50,683
Oh no. Finish your tweet. Just give us
a second. Here you go. Hash tag it.

967
01:21:51,684 --> 01:21:53,686
Go get her, tiger.

968
01:22:00,693 --> 01:22:04,697
I so pity the dude who
pressures her into prom sex.

969
01:22:04,797 --> 01:22:07,000
Alright then. Fire!

970
01:22:18,211 --> 01:22:19,902
Finish fucking her the fuck up!

971
01:22:20,112 --> 01:22:22,215
- Language, please.
- Suck a cock!

972
01:22:48,291 --> 01:22:52,045
Look away, child. Look away!

973
01:22:58,751 --> 01:23:03,756
- Wait! Wait!
- Cease fire! Cease fire!

974
01:23:03,857 --> 01:23:10,763
Fellas, hey, you only work for
that shit-spackled Muppet fart.

975
01:23:10,864 --> 01:23:12,566
So, I'mma give you a chance

976
01:23:12,575 --> 01:23:16,778
for y'all to lay down your firearms
in exchange for preferential,

977
01:23:16,787 --> 01:23:18,887
bordering on gentle, possibly...

978
01:23:19,772 --> 01:23:22,174
even lover-like treatment.

979
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:26,379
Fine! Commando!

980
01:24:38,451 --> 01:24:39,853
Teabag!

981
01:24:42,856 --> 01:24:46,258
- Bob?
- Wade?

982
01:24:46,459 --> 01:24:48,880
Oh my God, I haven't seen
you since, TGIFridays!

983
01:24:48,889 --> 01:24:50,271
Jacksonville. Fridays.

984
01:24:50,864 --> 01:24:55,468
What the hell! God!
Come here, you.

985
01:24:56,870 --> 01:25:01,922
How are the kids? Good? And Gail, is
she still fixing that tuna casserole?

986
01:25:01,931 --> 01:25:03,884
It's so good, but bad for...

987
01:25:10,884 --> 01:25:15,644
Your... on the left...
You are beautiful...

988
01:25:15,653 --> 01:25:18,899
That is so sweet! Thanks!

989
01:25:29,903 --> 01:25:33,907
Does he write you notes,
too? He's such a romantic.

990
01:25:34,007 --> 01:25:35,909
Don't worry, baby. I'm coming.

991
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:38,211
Fire!

992
01:25:44,918 --> 01:25:48,922
Hey! Climb on.

993
01:26:37,971 --> 01:26:41,975
Motherfucker shoulda
worn his brown pants.

994
01:26:42,976 --> 01:26:47,459
You were right, beautiful.
Red really is my color.

995
01:26:47,468 --> 01:26:48,589
Wade?

996
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:52,634
Don't worry, baby. I'mma
get you outta that shitbox.

997
01:26:52,785 --> 01:26:55,708
What better way to crawl back
inside that head of yours.

998
01:26:55,717 --> 01:26:56,997
Oh, you never left.

999
01:26:57,090 --> 01:27:00,994
- But you did, asshole!
- Deep breath, darling.

1000
01:27:01,995 --> 01:27:07,000
No wait.... Wrong
choice of words.

1001
01:27:08,001 --> 01:27:11,094
Well I hope they've blocked
pain to your every last nerve.

1002
01:27:11,103 --> 01:27:12,413
'Cause I'mma go looking!

1003
01:27:13,807 --> 01:27:16,286
I hear you grow back
body parts now, Wade.

1004
01:27:16,295 --> 01:27:19,120
When I'm finished, what's
left to grow back you?

1005
01:27:19,262 --> 01:27:23,016
Good one.... Yup.
That was a good one.

1006
01:27:23,116 --> 01:27:28,521
Let's dance. And by "dance", I
mean let's try to kill each other.

1007
01:28:22,675 --> 01:28:28,081
- Fine. Fists.
- Sounds like your last Saturday night.

1023
01:30:54,227 --> 01:30:56,929
I got a plan. You're
not gonna like it.

1024
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:09,242
Shit, shit, shit!

1025
01:31:13,246 --> 01:31:17,250
Don't worry! I'm
totally on top of this.

1026
01:31:32,265 --> 01:31:37,270
Dammit! Maximum effort!

1027
01:32:19,312 --> 01:32:21,314
Thanks.

1028
01:32:25,318 --> 01:32:28,321
Just take it slow.

1029
01:32:37,729 --> 01:32:41,033
Oh, my God! That was so awe...

1030
01:33:13,765 --> 01:33:18,892
Me and you, are headed
to fix this butter face!

1031
01:33:18,901 --> 01:33:20,180
What?

1032
01:33:21,374 --> 01:33:24,677
You sure are a fucking idiot.

1033
01:33:24,878 --> 01:33:30,984
Did you really think
there was a cure, for that?

1034
01:33:31,384 --> 01:33:35,388
- What?
- You heard me.

1035
01:33:35,488 --> 01:33:38,391
No, no!

1036
01:33:45,398 --> 01:33:53,406
So, you mean to say...
After all this, you can't fix me?

1037
01:33:53,907 --> 01:33:56,608
It sounds even
stupider when you say it.

1038
01:33:56,809 --> 01:34:01,414
Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't
do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for?

1039
01:34:05,418 --> 01:34:07,420
Any last words?

1040
01:34:08,421 --> 01:34:12,425
- What's my name?
- Who fucking cares!

1041
01:34:12,525 --> 01:34:14,027
Wade!

1042
01:34:14,427 --> 01:34:18,431
- Four or five moments.
- I'm sorry?

1043
01:34:18,531 --> 01:34:22,437
Four or five moments,
that's all it takes.

1044
01:34:22,446 --> 01:34:23,447
To...?

1045
01:34:23,536 --> 01:34:25,438
Be a hero.

1046
01:34:26,839 --> 01:34:30,843
Everyone thinks it's a full-time job.
Wake up a hero.

1047
01:34:30,852 --> 01:34:34,856
Brush your teeth a hero. Go
to work a hero. Not true.

1048
01:34:36,449 --> 01:34:41,454
Over a lifetime, there are only 4
or 5 moments that really matter.

1049
01:34:41,554 --> 01:34:44,257
Moments when you're
offered a choice.

1050
01:34:44,457 --> 01:34:48,461
To make a sacrifice, conquer
a flaw, save a friend...

1051
01:34:48,962 --> 01:34:52,465
spare an enemy.

1052
01:34:52,565 --> 01:34:57,470
In these moments,
everything else falls away.

1053
01:34:57,570 --> 01:35:02,475
The way the world sees us.
The way we...

1054
01:35:06,154 --> 01:35:07,655
Why?

1055
01:35:08,656 --> 01:35:13,661
You were droning on! Sure, I may be
stuck looking like pepperoni flat bread.

1056
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:16,664
But at least fuck-face
won't heal from that.

1057
01:35:16,763 --> 01:35:18,747
If wearing superhero tights

1058
01:35:18,756 --> 01:35:23,678
means sparing psychopaths then
maybe I wasn't meant to wear them.

1059
01:35:23,770 --> 01:35:27,675
- Not everyone martyred as a hall like you.
- Just promise...

1060
01:35:27,775 --> 01:35:31,679
Yeah, yeah, I'll be on the look
out for the next four moments.

1061
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:36,057
Now if you'll excuse
me, I'm just a boy,

1062
01:35:36,066 --> 01:35:40,265
about to stand in front of
a girl, and tell her...

1063
01:35:40,378 --> 01:35:45,283
- What the fuck am I gonna tell her?
- Well, you better figure it out.

1064
01:35:47,285 --> 01:35:50,019
I can't even tell you... I
deserve that... that too..

1065
01:35:50,028 --> 01:35:51,799
No, no, no, maybe
not the nethers.

1066
01:35:52,090 --> 01:35:54,292
Start talking!

1067
01:35:55,694 --> 01:36:02,901
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. For
everything. I'm sorry for leaving,

1068
01:36:03,301 --> 01:36:06,326
I'm sorry for not
cowboying up sooner...

1069
01:36:06,335 --> 01:36:08,907
It's been a rough
couple of years.

1070
01:36:08,917 --> 01:36:10,317
Rough?

1071
01:36:16,314 --> 01:36:21,319
I live in a crackhouse.
With a family of 12...

1072
01:36:22,721 --> 01:36:26,245
Every night we spoon for warmth,
everybody fights for Noelle.

1073
01:36:26,254 --> 01:36:27,334
She's the fattest.

1074
01:36:27,425 --> 01:36:33,331
There is nothing that we don't share.
Floor space, dental floss, even condoms.

1075
01:36:41,339 --> 01:36:44,022
So you live in a house?

1076
01:36:52,350 --> 01:36:55,353
I should've come
and found you sooner.

1077
01:36:56,354 --> 01:37:01,359
But everything under this mask,
he ain't the same one you remember.

1078
01:37:05,363 --> 01:37:07,365
You made this mask?

1079
01:37:26,384 --> 01:37:31,689
And this one. In case
the other fell off.

1080
01:37:36,394 --> 01:37:43,401
Like a band-aid. Just... Audi 5000.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1081
01:37:43,501 --> 01:37:45,403
Are you sure?

1082
01:37:46,404 --> 01:37:48,406
I'm sure.

1083
01:37:58,416 --> 01:38:01,419
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1084
01:38:12,229 --> 01:38:17,234
After a brief adjustment period,
and a bunch of drinks..

1085
01:38:17,324 --> 01:38:20,237
It's a face...

1086
01:38:23,339 --> 01:38:26,342
I'd be happy to sit on.

1087
01:38:33,250 --> 01:38:38,811
But I'm not the same
underneath this suit either.

1088
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:40,265
Super-penis.

1089
01:38:40,356 --> 01:38:44,261
Come on, Wade, language.
Young one is present.

1090
01:38:45,262 --> 01:38:48,070
What are you still doing...
Get outta here,

1091
01:38:48,079 --> 01:38:49,665
go make yourself useful.

1092
01:38:49,665 --> 01:38:51,988
You, go be a really big
brother to someone.

1093
01:38:51,997 --> 01:38:54,378
Tell Beast to stop
shitting on my lawn.

1094
01:38:54,471 --> 01:38:56,250
And you, chicken noodle.

1095
01:38:56,259 --> 01:39:00,184
Nothing Compares 2 U. Sinead
O'Connor, 1990. Sorry.

1096
01:39:00,277 --> 01:39:03,741
That's all right. You're cool.

1097
01:39:04,552 --> 01:39:06,490
What in the ass?

1098
01:39:06,582 --> 01:39:09,537
That was not mean!
I'm proud of you!

1099
01:39:09,546 --> 01:39:13,298
We will make an X-Man
of you yet, Wade.

1100
01:39:13,389 --> 01:39:14,932
You know, for a second there,

1101
01:39:14,941 --> 01:39:19,296
it felt like we were 3 mini lion robots
coming together to form one super robot.

1102
01:39:19,296 --> 01:39:22,299
- This was stupid.
- Yeah.

1103
01:39:25,302 --> 01:39:30,307
And now, for the moment
I've all been waiting for.

1104
01:39:33,310 --> 01:39:35,312
Come here.

1105
01:39:44,321 --> 01:39:48,325
WHAM! As promised.

1106
01:40:00,337 --> 01:40:04,341
See? You don't need to be
a superhero to get the girl.

1107
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:08,340
The right girl will bring
out the hero in you.

1108
01:40:08,441 --> 01:40:12,299
Now, let's finish this epic wide
shot, pull out, here we go...

1109
01:40:12,307 --> 01:40:16,459
Looks nice, not gonna be the only
thing that's pulling out tonight.

1110
01:40:16,753 --> 01:40:18,915
Who doesn't love a
happy ending, huh?

1111
01:40:18,918 --> 01:40:23,006
Until next time, this is your friendly
neighborhood Pool guy singing...

1112
01:40:23,071 --> 01:40:25,595
♪ I'm never gonna dance again ♪

1113
01:40:25,601 --> 01:40:28,627
♪ The way I dance with you, oh ♪

1114
01:40:29,245 --> 01:40:32,312
[PLEASE KEEP WATCHING AFTER THE CREDITS.]

1115
01:46:39,973 --> 01:46:41,975
You're still here.

1116
01:46:43,977 --> 01:46:47,281
It's over! Go home!

1117
01:46:48,533 --> 01:46:51,236
Oh, you're expecting a
teaser for Deadpool 2.

1118
01:46:51,245 --> 01:46:53,596
Well, we don't have
that kind of money.

1119
01:46:53,788 --> 01:46:57,549
What were you expecting,
Sam Jackson'll show up?

1120
01:46:57,558 --> 01:47:01,002
Eye patch? Saucy leather number?
Go.

1121
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:10,002
Oh! But I can tell you one thing
and it's a bit of a secret.

1122
01:47:10,002 --> 01:47:11,289
In the sequel,

1123
01:47:11,298 --> 01:47:14,508
we're gonna have Cable.
Amazing character.

1124
01:47:14,517 --> 01:47:15,917
Bionic arm, time-travel.

1125
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:17,488
We have no idea who we're gona cast yet,

1126
01:47:17,612 --> 01:47:20,114
but it could be anybody.
Just need a big guy with a flat top.

1127
01:47:20,114 --> 01:47:22,851
Could be Mel Gibson, Dolph
Lundgren, Keira Knightley.

1128
01:47:22,860 --> 01:47:25,427
She's got range, who knows?
Anyway, big secret. Shhhh!

1129
01:47:25,519 --> 01:47:27,533
Oh, and don't leave your
garbage all laying around.

1130
01:47:27,542 --> 01:47:31,663
It's a total dick move. Go.
