"00:02:38,602","00:02:39,938",Little help...
"00:02:40,748","00:02:45,115",Just... I have to keep my hands on the wheel.
"00:02:45,979","00:02:46,980",Excuse me!
"00:02:49,607","00:02:52,109",- Dopinder. - Pool. Dead.
"00:02:54,612","00:02:57,490","- Nice! - Smells good, no?"
"00:02:57,568","00:02:59,368",Not the daffodil daydream. The girl.
"00:02:59,570","00:03:03,073",Yes. Gita. She is quite lovely.
"00:03:03,173","00:03:05,915",She would have made me a very agreeable wife.
"00:03:06,024","00:03:06,984",But...
"00:03:07,077","00:03:10,880","Gita's heart has been stolen by my cousin, Bandu."
"00:03:11,081","00:03:15,484",He is as dishonorable as he is attractive.
"00:03:16,186","00:03:17,367","Dopinder,"
"00:03:17,375","00:03:20,398",I'm starting to think there's a reason I'm in this cab today.
"00:03:20,489","00:03:22,370","Yes, sir, you called for it, remember?"
"00:03:22,378","00:03:24,402","No, my slender, brown friend. Love..."
"00:03:25,095","00:03:26,423",is a beautiful thing.
"00:03:26,432","00:03:30,608","When you find it, the whole world tastes like daffodil daydream."
"00:03:30,701","00:03:34,403",So you gotta hold on to love. Tight!
"00:03:34,605","00:03:38,609","And never let go. Don't make the same mistakes I did, got it?"
"00:03:38,908","00:03:42,713",Or else the whole world tastes like Mama June after hot yoga.
"00:03:43,113","00:03:45,515","Sir, what does Miss Mama June taste like?"
"00:03:45,716","00:03:48,668",Like two hobos fucking in a shoe filled with piss.
"00:03:48,678","00:03:51,629","I can go all day, Dopinder. The point is it's bad."
"00:03:53,123","00:03:55,926","Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool?"
"00:03:56,126","00:03:58,497","Oh, that's because it's Christmas day, Dopinder,"
"00:03:58,506","00:04:00,539",and I'm after someone on my naughty list.
"00:04:00,631","00:04:04,280","I've been waiting, 1 year, 3 weeks, 6 days and..."
"00:04:04,288","00:04:07,645",14 minutes to make him fix what he did to me.
"00:04:07,710","00:04:10,506","And what did he do to you, Mr. Pool?"
"00:04:10,514","00:04:11,723",This shit.
"00:04:13,716","00:04:14,717",Boo!
"00:04:34,737","00:04:38,741",- They won't disappoint. - They'd better not!
"00:04:38,842","00:04:42,145",- What about next month's shipment? - There won't be one.
"00:04:42,906","00:04:45,218",You're not the only one with a war to win.
"00:04:45,748","00:04:47,950",That won't do.
"00:04:49,752","00:04:54,456","See, we've had this small disruption to our supply trade."
"00:04:57,815","00:05:01,819",We'd appreciate your patience.
"00:05:02,820","00:05:04,422",Okay...
"00:05:04,449","00:05:06,350",We'll deliver in full the following month.
"00:05:10,253","00:05:12,255",Pleasure doing business with you.
"00:05:15,258","00:05:17,260",Fucking mutant!
"00:05:27,270","00:05:30,273",Shit! I forgot my ammo bag!
"00:05:30,373","00:05:34,778",- Shall we turn back? - No time. Fuck it. I got this.
"00:05:34,977","00:05:39,282","9, 10, 11, 12 bullets. Or bust. Right here!"
"00:05:41,284","00:05:43,686",That's $27.50.
"00:05:43,886","00:05:47,791",I never carry a wallet while I'm working. Ruins the lines of my suit.
"00:05:48,291","00:05:50,967",- But how 'bout a crisp high-five? - Okay.
"00:05:50,967","00:05:52,384",Merry Christmas!
"00:05:52,921","00:05:56,024","And a convivial Tuesday and April to you too, Pool!"

"00:06:19,255","00:06:20,857","I know, right?"
"00:06:20,867","00:06:25,069",Whose balls did I have to fondle to get my very own movie?
"00:06:25,162","00:06:26,237","I can't tell you,"
"00:06:26,245","00:06:29,975","but it does rhyme with ""Pulverine"". And lemme tell you..."
"00:06:30,366","00:06:34,270",He's got a nice pair of smooth criminals down under!
"00:06:34,571","00:06:38,324","Anyway. I got places to be. A face to fix. And, oh!"
"00:06:38,374","00:06:40,577",Bad guys to kill.
"00:06:46,282","00:06:48,284",Maximum effort.
"00:06:57,293","00:06:58,895",Cock shot!
"00:07:06,302","00:07:09,305","Rich, Corinthian leather!"
"00:07:10,306","00:07:12,909",I'm looking for Francis!
"00:07:13,109","00:07:15,012",Have you seen this man?
"00:07:24,320","00:07:26,823","Yanking, yanking!"
"00:07:58,354","00:08:01,058","I've never said this, but don't swallow."
"00:08:22,378","00:08:25,982",Shit. Did I leave the stove on?
"00:08:43,299","00:08:45,202","Now, breaking news."
"00:08:45,401","00:08:49,405",A multi-car collision turned shots fired on the crosstown expressway this morning.
"00:08:49,506","00:08:51,628",Gridlock has kept police from the scene.
"00:08:51,637","00:08:54,118",Residents are advised to remain in their homes.
"00:08:54,410","00:08:57,413","The assailant appears to be armed, dangerous, and wearing a..."
"00:08:57,514","00:09:00,416",Red suit. Deadpool.
"00:09:00,517","00:09:03,621",Negasonic! Come. We have mission.
"00:09:03,820","00:09:06,322","Colossus, wait up."
"00:09:06,422","00:09:09,926",I've given Deadpool every chance to join us.
"00:09:10,127","00:09:14,931",But he'd rather act like a child. A heavily armed child.
"00:09:15,132","00:09:18,835",When will he grow up and see benefits of becoming X-Man?
"00:09:19,035","00:09:21,037","Which benefits, the matching unitards?"
"00:09:21,046","00:09:23,147",The house that blows up every few years?
"00:09:23,439","00:09:26,442",Please. House blowing up builds character.
"00:09:26,543","00:09:31,848","You ate breakfast, yes? Breakfast is most important meal of day."
"00:09:32,048","00:09:36,153",Here. Protein bar. Good for bones.
"00:09:36,352","00:09:38,955",Deadpool may try to break yours.
"00:10:06,483","00:10:08,084",Hey!
"00:10:18,696","00:10:22,599",Wait! You may be wondering why the red suit.
"00:10:22,800","00:10:25,401",Well that's so bad guys can't see me bleed.
"00:10:25,502","00:10:28,404",This guy's got the right idea. He wore the brown pants.
"00:10:30,507","00:10:34,211","Fine! I only have 12 bullets, so you're gonna have to share!"
"00:10:34,410","00:10:36,012",Let's count 'em down!
"00:10:56,132","00:11:01,437","Shit, motherfucker!"
"00:11:01,538","00:11:03,340",Ten! Shit.
"00:11:03,540","00:11:08,144",Nine! Fuck. Eight. Shit-fuck!
"00:11:11,348","00:11:13,149",Bad Deadpool.
"00:11:13,950","00:11:16,553",Seven. Good Deadpool!
"00:11:38,375","00:11:40,377",Someone's not counting.
"00:11:40,477","00:11:41,578",Six!
"00:12:07,604","00:12:09,606",Four...
"00:12:11,308","00:12:12,609",Gotcha!
"00:12:13,610","00:12:16,112",Right up main street!
"00:12:19,616","00:12:23,320","Three, two! Stupid! Worth it."
"00:12:48,645","00:12:51,648",I'm touching myself tonight.
"00:12:51,748","00:12:54,651",Francis! Francis!
"00:12:56,653","00:13:01,257","What the shitbiscuit! Where you at, Francis?"
"00:13:09,666","00:13:11,668",You're not Francis!
"00:13:18,675","00:13:21,678",Really? Rolling up the sleeves?
"00:13:30,687","00:13:34,671","You're probably thinking, ""my boyfriend said this was a superhero movie"
"00:13:34,681","00:13:38,695",but that guy in the red suit just turned that other guy into a fucking kebab.
"00:13:38,696","00:13:42,900","Well, I may be super. But I'm no hero."
"00:13:43,700","00:13:45,611","Anyhow, technically, this is a murder."
"00:13:45,620","00:13:48,313",But some of the best love stories start with a murder.
"00:13:48,506","00:13:52,559","And that's exactly what this is: a love story. And to tell it right,"
"00:13:52,660","00:13:57,515",I gotta take you back to long before I squeeze this ass into red spandex.
"00:13:57,714","00:14:03,319","Look, would it help if I slow it down for you? I didn't order the pizza."
"00:14:03,521","00:14:06,623",Is this 7348 Redledge Drive?
"00:14:06,723","00:14:07,816",Are you Mr. Merchant?
"00:14:07,825","00:14:11,336",The Mr. Merchant who didn't order the fucking pie!
"00:14:11,828","00:14:14,330",- Who placed the call? - I did!
"00:14:15,732","00:14:21,337",Pineapple and olive? Sweet and salty!
"00:14:21,438","00:14:24,340",The fuck are you? The fuck are you doing in my crib?
"00:14:24,542","00:14:27,945","- Is that bread crust? Don't move! - God, I hope not."
"00:14:28,045","00:14:31,748","Look, is this about that poker game? I told Howie..."
"00:14:33,750","00:14:36,753",- Just take whatever you want. - Thanks!
"00:14:37,153","00:14:40,958","Sir, before you do anything to him, do you mind if I get a big tip?"
"00:14:42,759","00:14:45,762","- Jeremy, is it? Wade Wilson. - Yeah."
"00:14:45,862","00:14:49,467","That is a no go on the tip-aroo, Jer."
"00:14:49,567","00:14:52,769",I'm not here for him. I'm here for you.
"00:14:53,770","00:14:56,478",I dodged a big-time bullet on that one!
"00:14:56,487","00:14:58,583","Not, out of the woods yet."
"00:14:58,775","00:15:01,647",You need to seriously ease up on the bedazzling.
"00:15:01,656","00:15:03,588","They're jeans, not a chandelier."
"00:15:03,680","00:15:06,080",Yes I'm keeping your wallet. You did kind of give it to me.
"00:15:06,081","00:15:10,588","- Just look, man, can I have my... - I will shoot your fucking cat."
"00:15:10,787","00:15:12,990","I don't really know what that means, I don't have a cat."
"00:15:13,090","00:15:15,792",Then whose kitty litter did I just shit in?
"00:15:18,795","00:15:20,097",Anywho...
"00:15:20,396","00:15:24,801",Tell me something. What situation isn't improved by pizza?
"00:15:25,102","00:15:29,405",Do you happen to know a Megan Orflosky? Get that right? Orflovsky?
"00:15:31,808","00:15:34,512",'Cause she knows you. Jeremy...
"00:15:34,811","00:15:38,214",I belong to a group of guys who take a dime to beat a fella down.
"00:15:38,414","00:15:43,020","And little Megan, she's not made of money, but lucky for her, I got a soft spot."
"00:15:43,820","00:15:45,822",- I'm..... - A stalker.
"00:15:45,922","00:15:50,827","Threats hurt, Jer. Though not nearly as badly as serrated steel."
"00:15:50,927","00:15:56,833","- So keep away from Megan. Cool? - Yes, sir."
"00:15:56,933","00:15:59,836","- And we're done. - Wait, we are?"
"00:15:59,936","00:16:03,641",Totally done. You should've seen your face!
"00:16:03,840","00:16:05,771","I didn't know what to do, I was so scared..."
"00:16:05,780","00:16:06,852","Soft spot, remember?"
"00:16:07,844","00:16:12,074",Even look in her general direction again and you will learn in the worst of ways
"00:16:12,083","00:16:13,859","that I have some hard spots, too."
"00:16:14,851","00:16:16,853",That came out wrong.
"00:16:17,854","00:16:19,856",Or did it?
"00:16:31,868","00:16:33,870",Megan.
"00:16:35,872","00:16:39,076",You've heard the last of Jeremy. He's sorry.
"00:16:39,375","00:16:41,878",No friggin' way.
"00:16:45,883","00:16:48,886",Should've brought my roller blades. Show these kids how it's done.
"00:16:49,085","00:16:51,889",And that's why we do it. But mostly the money.
"00:16:52,088","00:16:53,891",Hey. Think you can fuck up my step dad?
"00:16:54,090","00:16:56,894","If I can give the guy a pavement facial, it's 'cause he's earned it."
"00:16:57,194","00:16:58,896","Hey, wait."
"00:16:59,897","00:17:03,901","- You're my hero. - No, no, no, no, no. That, I ain't."
"00:17:05,903","00:17:10,708","Nope. Never will be. - Fuck you, Wade."
"00:17:10,807","00:17:13,911",I'm just a bad guy who gets paid to fuck up worse guys.
"00:17:14,912","00:17:19,917",Welcome to Sister Margaret's. It's like a job fair for mercenaries.
"00:17:20,016","00:17:22,246",Think of us as really fucked up tooth fairies
"00:17:22,255","00:17:24,629",except we knock out the teeth and take the cash.
"00:17:24,922","00:17:28,692",You'd best hope we never see your name on a gold card.
"00:17:28,701","00:17:29,934",(Buck! Liefeld.)
"00:17:30,126","00:17:32,930","- Hey, Wade! - Wade Wilson. Patron Saint of the Pitiful."
"00:17:33,029","00:17:35,933",- What can I do for you? - I'd love a blowjob.
"00:17:36,032","00:17:40,237","- Oh, God, me too. - The drink. With snuggle. But first..."
"00:17:40,938","00:17:43,358","- Hey, I ain't taking any babysitting money,"
"00:17:43,367","00:17:45,950",make sure that gets back to Miss... - Orlovsky?
"00:17:46,944","00:17:48,445",- You sure? - Hmm.
"00:17:48,445","00:17:50,420","For a merc, you're pretty warm-blooded."
"00:17:50,429","00:17:52,456","Bet you let the kid off easy, too."
"00:17:52,950","00:17:54,350",He's not a bad kid.
"00:17:54,359","00:17:56,035",Just a little light stalking.
"00:17:56,044","00:17:59,972","I was way worse when I was his age, travelling to exotic places..."
"00:18:00,056","00:18:01,759","Baghdad, Mogadishu, Jacksonville,"
"00:18:01,768","00:18:04,168",meeting new and exciting people. And then..
"00:18:04,261","00:18:06,529","Killing them. Yeah, I've seen your instagram."
"00:18:06,538","00:18:09,274",So what were special forces doing in Jacksonville?
"00:18:09,467","00:18:12,970",That's classified. They have wonderful TGIFridays!
"00:18:13,069","00:18:16,974","Alright, kahlua, baileys and whipped cream."
"00:18:17,073","00:18:18,976","I give you, a blowjob. I'm..."
"00:18:19,075","00:18:21,979","- Why do you make me make that? - Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly..."
"00:18:22,078","00:18:26,283","Take that over there to Buck, please and tell him it's from Booth. Little foreplay."
"00:18:26,484","00:18:28,480",Remind me what good will come of this?
"00:18:28,489","00:18:30,995","I don't take the shits, I just disturb them."
"00:18:31,989","00:18:33,991",What you want?
"00:18:35,993","00:18:39,997",- Cheers. To your health. - Fuck you.
"00:18:40,998","00:18:43,000",That's a new stool.
"00:18:48,005","00:18:50,007",Stay the fuck down.
"00:18:54,011","00:18:56,112","Alright, move, move, move, move."
"00:18:56,212","00:18:57,213","Buck, go rest."
"00:19:04,021","00:19:06,023",He's still breathing.
"00:19:08,025","00:19:12,029","Nobody wins today. Nice try, Wade."
"00:19:12,128","00:19:15,032",You got me. I picked Booth in the dead pool. Who did you pick?
"00:19:16,033","00:19:21,038","- You know, Wade, about that.... - No. You did not bet on me to die."
"00:19:23,040","00:19:24,402",You bet on me to die.
"00:19:24,411","00:19:27,853","Wow. Motherfucker, you're the world's worst friend."
"00:19:28,045","00:19:30,310","Well, joke's on you. I'm living to 102."
"00:19:30,320","00:19:32,557",And then die. At the city of Detroit.
"00:19:32,649","00:19:34,898",I'm sorry. I wanted to win money.
"00:19:34,907","00:19:36,961",I never win anything.
"00:19:37,054","00:19:40,256","Whatever. Soldiers of fortune, drink's on me!"
"00:19:40,265","00:19:41,366",Yeah!
"00:19:42,059","00:19:44,061",Domestic! Nothing imported.
"00:19:46,063","00:19:48,465","Woah, woah, woah. Baby..."
"00:19:49,066","00:19:51,068",Are you sure you wanna shoot your whole wad?
"00:19:54,071","00:19:56,073",Tight.
"00:19:56,574","00:19:58,576",- Vanessa. - Wade.
"00:19:59,076","00:20:02,079",What's a nice place like you doing in a girl like this?
"00:20:02,178","00:20:04,081",I'd hit that.
"00:20:05,082","00:20:09,086","Buck, you'd best apologize before... yeah. That."
"00:20:09,185","00:20:12,089","- Say the magic words, fat Gandalf. - I'm sorry."
"00:20:12,188","00:20:13,409",Breathe through the nose.
"00:20:13,418","00:20:16,100",I don't have a filter between my brain and my...
"00:20:16,192","00:20:20,097","Okay, hey. Hakuna his tatas, he's sorry!"
"00:20:20,196","00:20:22,471",Get outta here. Go cast a spell.
"00:20:22,480","00:20:25,109","Hey, hands off the merchandise."
"00:20:26,103","00:20:30,107","Merchandise, huh. So you..."
"00:20:30,206","00:20:33,110",- Fun fuzzies for money? - Yup.
"00:20:33,209","00:20:34,232",Rough childhood?
"00:20:34,241","00:20:37,021",Rougher than yours. Daddy left before I was born.
"00:20:37,114","00:20:40,117",Daddy left before I was conceived.
"00:20:40,216","00:20:41,918",Ever had a cigarette put out on your skin?
"00:20:41,927","00:20:43,127",Where else do you put one out?
"00:20:43,219","00:20:45,923","- I was molested. - Me, too. Uncle."
"00:20:46,123","00:20:48,125",Uncles. They took turns.
"00:20:48,134","00:20:50,175",I watched my own birthday party through the keyhole
"00:20:50,184","00:20:52,144",of a locked closet which also happens to be my...
"00:20:52,228","00:20:56,133",Your bedroom. Lucky. I slept in a dishwasher box.
"00:20:56,232","00:20:57,675",You had a dishwasher.
"00:20:57,684","00:20:59,303",I didn't even know sleep.
"00:20:59,312","00:21:03,456","It was pretty much 24/7 ball kegs, brownie mix and clown porn."
"00:21:06,143","00:21:08,145",Who would do such a thing?
"00:21:09,146","00:21:13,150","Hopefully, you. Later tonight?"
"00:21:16,153","00:21:23,160",What can I get for 275 dollars and a yogurt rewards card?
"00:21:23,259","00:21:26,163","Baby, about 48 minutes of whatever the fuck you want."
"00:21:27,164","00:21:30,167",And a low-fat dessert.
"00:21:36,173","00:21:39,176",Did she just put a gift card in your mouth?
"00:21:40,177","00:21:43,180",It's time to put balls in holes.
"00:21:43,279","00:21:46,183",- You said whatever I want. - I get it.
"00:21:47,184","00:21:50,622",You love ski ball. Apparently more than you love vagina.
"00:21:50,631","00:21:52,196",That's a tough call.
"00:21:52,490","00:21:55,590",I just wanna get to know the real you.
"00:21:55,599","00:21:56,659",Not the short-
"00:21:56,668","00:22:00,113",shorted 2-dimensional sex object peddled by Hollywood.
"00:22:00,197","00:22:02,199",Balls in holes.
"00:22:03,200","00:22:06,203","- Prepare to lose tragically. - Bring it, big man."
"00:22:13,210","00:22:18,214","A limited edition Voltron: Defender of the Universe ring, por favor."
"00:22:18,215","00:22:20,217",Okay. Here you go.
"00:22:21,218","00:22:23,220",I had this sucker for a while.
"00:22:23,319","00:22:25,723",- And I will take the pencil eraser. - Okay.
"00:22:26,223","00:22:29,980",You are now the proud protector of the planet Arus.
"00:22:29,989","00:22:33,237","And you, can erase stuff. Written in pencil."
"00:22:33,329","00:22:34,410",Milady.
"00:22:34,419","00:22:38,343","I hate to break it to you, but your 48 minutes are up."
"00:22:38,736","00:22:41,238",How many more minutes could I get for this?
"00:22:41,337","00:22:46,243","FYI, 5 mini lion bots come together to form 1 superbot."
"00:22:46,342","00:22:48,897",5 mini lion bots? 3 minutes.
"00:22:48,906","00:22:53,559",Deal. What do we do with the remaining 2:37?
"00:22:53,751","00:22:54,752",Cuddle?
"00:22:59,256","00:23:03,260",- How long can we keep this up? - All year?
"00:23:12,269","00:23:15,272",Happy Valentines' Day.
"00:23:21,278","00:23:25,282",- Happy Chinese New Year. - Year of the Dog.
"00:23:30,287","00:23:35,292",Relax... and happy International Women's Day.
"00:23:44,301","00:23:46,303",Happy Lenten.
"00:23:50,307","00:23:55,312",- Wade! - Sorry. Happy Halloween!
"00:24:03,320","00:24:06,323",Happy Thanksgiving.
"00:24:07,324","00:24:09,326",I love you.
"00:24:12,329","00:24:16,333","If your left leg is Thanksgiving, and your right leg is Christmas..."
"00:24:16,933","00:24:20,337",Can I visit you between the holidays?
"00:24:20,436","00:24:23,340",That sweater is terrible!
"00:24:24,341","00:24:26,343",But red looks good on you.
"00:24:26,443","00:24:29,346",Red's your color. Mine's like the bloodshot in your eyes.
"00:24:29,746","00:24:31,649",- Listen. I've been thinking. - Really?
"00:24:33,350","00:24:36,353",- 'Bout why we're so good together. - Why is that?
"00:24:37,354","00:24:41,358",Your crazy matches my crazy. Bigtime.
"00:24:42,359","00:24:46,363",And we're like 2 jigsaw pieces. Weird curvy edges?
"00:24:46,463","00:24:49,586",You put them together and you can see the picture on top.
"00:24:49,595","00:24:50,676",Right.
"00:24:51,368","00:24:55,372",Wade... There's something I've been meaning to ask you.
"00:24:55,472","00:24:58,375",But only because you haven't gotten around to asking me.
"00:24:59,376","00:25:01,378",Will you...
"00:25:02,379","00:25:05,382",- Stick it up my... - ...Marry me?
"00:25:06,383","00:25:08,385",Uh... Jinx?
"00:25:10,387","00:25:12,389",- Where were you hiding that? - Nowhere.
"00:25:12,489","00:25:15,792","- They said 1-month salary, so... - You mean..."
"00:25:15,992","00:25:18,395",- I do. - That's my line.
"00:25:21,398","00:25:25,101","- I love you, Wade Wilson. - You're supposed to... So that's a..."
"00:25:25,402","00:25:27,404",- Yes! - Woo! Yes!
"00:25:30,407","00:25:32,409",I feel just like a little girl!
"00:25:37,414","00:25:40,120",What if I just held on and never let go?
"00:25:40,129","00:25:43,427",Just ride the bitch's back like Yoda on Luke.
"00:25:43,520","00:25:47,424",- Star Wars jokes! - Empire!
"00:25:48,425","00:25:51,428","Jesus Christ, it's like I made you in a computer!"
"00:25:57,434","00:25:59,436",Perfect.
"00:26:03,441","00:26:06,444","Pee break. Shake it, yeah."
"00:26:11,449","00:26:13,451",Here's the thing:
"00:26:13,550","00:26:15,718",Life is an endless series of train wrecks
"00:26:15,727","00:26:18,463",with only brief commercial-like breaks of happiness.
"00:26:19,457","00:26:23,461",This had been the ultimate commercial break.
"00:26:24,462","00:26:28,466","Which meant it was time to return, to our regularly scheduled programme."
"00:26:28,766","00:26:31,469","- What the fu..... - Oh my God, Wade!"
"00:26:37,475","00:26:42,480",You're clowning. You're not clowning. I sense clowns.
"00:26:42,980","00:26:46,484",People react to news of late- stage cancer differently.
"00:26:46,583","00:26:49,176",There are certainly options we can look into.
"00:26:49,185","00:26:51,496",New drugs are being developed every day.
"00:26:54,492","00:26:59,497","So what do we do? Surely, there is something we can do."
"00:26:59,596","00:27:02,355",My Uncle Ivan was diagnosed with Thyroid cancer
"00:27:02,364","00:27:05,811",and there were all these experimental drugs from Germany...
"00:27:06,003","00:27:09,507","Vanessa's already working on plan A, B, all the way through Z."
"00:27:10,508","00:27:13,758",Me? I'm memorizing the details of her face.
"00:27:13,767","00:27:16,721",Like it's the first time I'm seeing it.
"00:27:17,113","00:27:19,517","- Or the last... - Mr. Wilson, Mr. Wilson?"
"00:27:21,519","00:27:24,103",Take your time to process this.
"00:27:24,112","00:27:27,532",It's important not to do anything rash.
"00:27:38,536","00:27:43,541","Now, if I were a 200 pound sack of assholes named Francis, where would I hide?"
"00:28:09,567","00:28:13,605","""A hush falls over the crowd as rookie sensation Wade W."
"00:28:13,614","00:28:17,582","Wilson out of Regina, Saskatchewan, lines up the shot."""
"00:28:18,576","00:28:20,578","""His form looks good."""
"00:28:22,580","00:28:27,084","""And that's why Regina rhymes with fun."""
"00:28:27,283","00:28:31,889","""Ladies and gentlemen, what you're witnessing is sweet, dick-kicking revenge!"""
"00:28:32,590","00:28:36,594","""Giving him the business! Incoming!"""
"00:28:36,693","00:28:40,598","""This is taking unsportsman-like conduct to a whole new level!"""
"00:28:45,603","00:28:49,406","Looking good, Francis. Well-rested. Like you've been pitching, not catching."
"00:28:49,607","00:28:52,610",Ringing any bells? No?
"00:28:56,614","00:28:58,616",How 'bout now?
"00:29:02,218","00:29:04,622",Wade fucking Wilson.
"00:29:06,624","00:29:08,091","Well, hello, gorgeous."
"00:29:08,100","00:29:11,636","Yeah, like I got bit by a radioactive Shar Pei."
"00:29:11,728","00:29:16,631","And whose fault is that, huh, Francis? Time to undo what you did to this butter face."
"00:29:16,633","00:29:17,811",You should thank me.
"00:29:17,820","00:29:21,646","Apparently, I've made you immortal. I'm actually quite jealous."
"00:29:21,738","00:29:25,142","Yeah, but this ain't a life worth living, is it? Now..."
"00:29:25,643","00:29:30,648",I'm about to do to you what Limp Bizkit did to music in the late 90's.
"00:29:31,649","00:29:33,651",Dad?
"00:29:36,654","00:29:40,658",I think we can all agree that shit just went sideways in the most colossal way.
"00:29:41,659","00:29:44,260","Well, maybe not the most."
"00:29:45,261","00:29:48,165","Now this, is my most prized possession."
"00:29:48,666","00:29:52,169","- Wham? - No, no, no, no. WHAM!"
"00:29:52,429","00:29:55,673",Make It Big is the album that George and Andy earned the exclamation point.
"00:29:55,772","00:29:59,677","So, am I supposed to just smile and wave you out the door?"
"00:29:59,776","00:30:02,680",Think of it like spring cleaning. Only if spring was death.
"00:30:02,779","00:30:06,684","God, if I had a nickel for everytime I spanked at the Bernadette Peters."
"00:30:07,685","00:30:10,720",Sounds like you have. Bernadette is not going...
"00:30:10,746","00:30:13,714","anywhere, because you're not going anywhere."
"00:30:14,358","00:30:15,659",- Drink. - You're right.
"00:30:15,860","00:30:19,363","Cancer's only in my liver, lungs, prostate and brain. All things I can live without."
"00:30:21,365","00:30:23,013",You belong here at home.
"00:30:23,022","00:30:27,278","Surrounded by your Voltron, and your Bernadette and your me."
"00:30:27,371","00:30:32,376","Listen, we both know that cancer is a shit show."
"00:30:32,382","00:30:34,523","Like a jack-off, Smirnoff,"
"00:30:34,532","00:30:39,797",opening for the spin doctors at the Iowa state fair shit show.
"00:30:39,890","00:30:46,596","And under no circumstances will I take you, to that show."
"00:30:46,697","00:30:51,601","I want you to remember me. Not the ""ghost of Christmas"" me."
"00:30:51,702","00:30:53,302",I wanna remember us!
"00:30:53,311","00:30:54,593","I swear to God,"
"00:30:54,602","00:30:58,701",I'll find you in the next life and boom box Careless Whisper outside your window.
"00:30:58,710","00:30:59,733",WHAM!
"00:31:03,112","00:31:06,416",No one is boom boxing shit. Okay?
"00:31:09,219","00:31:11,421",We can fight this.
"00:31:13,200","00:31:15,900","Besides, I just realized something."
"00:31:16,000","00:31:17,800",You win.
"00:31:17,900","00:31:20,200",Your life is officially way more fucked up than mine
"00:31:25,800","00:31:27,000",I love you!
"00:31:38,300","00:31:39,502",Wade.
"00:31:41,752","00:31:42,954",Wease.
"00:31:42,963","00:31:45,417",You look like you need a blowjob and a shower.
"00:31:45,425","00:31:47,773","Little courtesy calls for the latter, first."
"00:31:47,857","00:31:49,677",How about three shots of patron.
"00:31:49,686","00:31:52,271","Or, how about, Triticum aestivum?"
"00:31:52,662","00:31:54,786",Wheatgrass. Excellent for the immune system.
"00:31:54,795","00:31:56,775","Jesus Christ, you sound like Vanessa."
"00:31:56,866","00:31:57,894","Here, check it out."
"00:31:57,903","00:32:00,878",She's sending away for all these colorful clinic brochures.
"00:32:01,272","00:32:03,873",I'm sure they're all FDA approved.
"00:32:03,975","00:32:07,144",Chechnya? Isn't that where you go to get cancer?
"00:32:07,153","00:32:09,487",We got China and Central Mexico.
"00:32:09,879","00:32:12,202",You know how they say cancer in Spanish?
"00:32:12,211","00:32:13,391",No.
"00:32:13,784","00:32:16,787","- ""El cancer."" - I could've guessed that."
"00:32:17,788","00:32:19,155",Look how happy you look here.
"00:32:19,164","00:32:21,800","You mind if I keep this, put it up, so I can remember?"
"00:32:21,891","00:32:23,286",When you looked alive.
"00:32:23,295","00:32:26,011",At least now I'm gonna win the dead pool.
"00:32:26,020","00:32:28,807","Now that you'll die, tragically, of cancer."
"00:32:28,898","00:32:30,301","I got it, thanks."
"00:32:33,304","00:32:37,808",That guy over there came in looking for you. Real grim reaper type.
"00:32:38,509","00:32:40,811",I don't know. Might further the plot.
"00:32:44,414","00:32:46,817",- Booth. - Wade.
"00:32:52,222","00:32:53,324",Mr. Wilson.
"00:32:53,333","00:32:54,959","How can I help you, besides"
"00:32:54,968","00:32:57,243",luring children into a panel van?
"00:32:57,328","00:32:59,936",I understand you've recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer.
"00:33:01,045","00:33:02,139",Stalker alert!
"00:33:02,231","00:33:04,285",It's my job. Recruitment.
"00:33:04,595","00:33:07,953",I'm sorry you've had such a tough go.
"00:33:08,438","00:33:09,717",But you're a fighter.
"00:33:09,926","00:33:13,076",Special Forces. 41 confirmed kills.
"00:33:13,287","00:33:17,254",1 every 7 weeks. Same rate most folks get a haircut.
"00:33:18,348","00:33:19,782",This should wash the taste down.
"00:33:19,791","00:33:22,660",It's tough to forget being so impressive.
"00:33:23,152","00:33:26,975",And now you spend your days sticking up for the little people.
"00:33:27,083","00:33:28,966",People change. What do you want?
"00:33:29,158","00:33:33,863",I represent an organization that may be able to help.
"00:33:34,062","00:33:38,567",What if I told you we can cure your cancer?
"00:33:38,567","00:33:42,821","And what's more, give you abilities most men only dream of."
"00:33:46,376","00:33:48,478",I'd say that you sound like an infomercial. But...
"00:33:48,651","00:33:51,754","Not a good one, like Slapchop, more Shakeweighty."
"00:33:51,955","00:33:56,960",The world needs extraordinary soldiers. We won't just make you better.
"00:33:56,960","00:33:59,762",We will make you better than better.
"00:34:01,664","00:34:02,941",A superhero.
"00:34:02,966","00:34:05,476","Look, Agent Smith,"
"00:34:05,485","00:34:08,002",I tried the hero business and it left a mark.
"00:34:08,071","00:34:10,974","But if I ever hit fuck- it, I'll look you up."
"00:34:11,975","00:34:13,776",Oh. Shit.
"00:34:13,977","00:34:17,981","We're within 500 yards of the school. So you may wanna, you know..."
"00:34:20,984","00:34:22,986",His drink's on him.
"00:34:27,991","00:34:29,993",What'd he say?
"00:34:52,636","00:34:54,055","Hey, what's going on?"
"00:34:55,150","00:34:59,755","Hey, sorry. I had a Liam Neeson nightmare."
"00:35:00,756","00:35:04,060",I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter and he just wasn't having it.
"00:35:14,070","00:35:16,072",They made 3 of those movies.
"00:35:17,073","00:35:20,076","At some point, you'd have to wonder if he's just a bad parent."
"00:35:34,090","00:35:37,393",The worst part about cancer isn't what it does to you.
"00:35:38,094","00:35:40,096",But what it does to the people you love.
"00:35:42,098","00:35:44,637",Who knew if this guy could save my life?
"00:35:44,646","00:35:48,111",But I knew there's only one way that I could save hers.
"00:35:51,107","00:35:53,700",Isn't that what superheroes do?
"00:36:05,515","00:36:09,519",Okay. Let's pro/con this superhero thing.
"00:36:11,521","00:36:14,835","Pro: they pull down a gaggle of ass,"
"00:36:14,845","00:36:17,135","local dry cleaning discounts, lucrative film deals,"
"00:36:17,228","00:36:20,231","both origin stories and larger, ensemble team movies."
"00:36:20,231","00:36:23,334",Con: they're all lame- ass teacher's pets!
"00:36:23,335","00:36:25,332",You know I can hear you.
"00:36:25,341","00:36:28,447",Wasn't talking to you. I was talking to them.
"00:36:28,538","00:36:29,843",Stay right here.
"00:36:29,852","00:36:32,942","You've been warned before, Deadpool."
"00:36:32,942","00:36:36,499",This is a shameful and reckless use of your powers.
"00:36:36,508","00:36:38,546",You will both be coming with us.
"00:36:38,548","00:36:43,072","Look Colossus, I don't have time for the goody two-tissues bullshit right now."
"00:36:43,081","00:36:44,762",And you are?
"00:36:45,856","00:36:47,858",Negasonic Teenage Warhead.
"00:36:47,957","00:36:51,461",Negasonic Teenage... What the shit?!
"00:36:51,662","00:36:53,865",That's the coolest name ever!
"00:36:54,865","00:36:58,869","- So what, you're like his sidekick? - No. Trainee."
"00:36:58,968","00:37:03,232","Let me guess, X-Men left you behind on what, shit detail?"
"00:37:03,241","00:37:04,782",What does that make you?
"00:37:04,875","00:37:08,077","Pretending you're not here, Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Can we trade names?"
"00:37:08,578","00:37:11,979","- Can we go? - ""Look! I'm a teenage girl!"""
"00:37:11,981","00:37:13,913","""I'd rather be anywhere than here."
"00:37:13,922","00:37:18,253","I'm all about long, sullen silences, followed by mean comments,"
"00:37:18,262","00:37:20,205","followed by more silences."""
"00:37:20,490","00:37:22,085",So what's it gonna be? huh?
"00:37:22,094","00:37:25,903","Long, sullen silence? Or mean comment? Go on."
"00:37:27,898","00:37:29,485",You got me in a box here.
"00:37:29,494","00:37:33,712","We can't allow this, Deadpool. Please, come quietly."
"00:37:34,003","00:37:36,907","- You big, chrome cockgobbler! - That's not nice."
"00:37:37,006","00:37:39,910",You really got to fuck this up for me? Trust me...
"00:37:40,009","00:37:45,916",That wheezing bag of dick-tits has it coming! He's pure evil!
"00:37:46,015","00:37:49,920","Besides, nobody's getting hurt."
"00:37:54,925","00:37:57,627",That guy was already up there when I got here.
"00:37:57,627","00:38:00,047","Wade, you are better than this."
"00:38:00,056","00:38:03,267","Join us, use your powers for good."
"00:38:03,283","00:38:05,098",- Heads up! - Be a superhero.
"00:38:05,107","00:38:09,347","- Listen! The day I decide to be a crime-fighting shit-swizzler,"
"00:38:09,440","00:38:11,467","who rooms with a bunch of other little whiners,"
"00:38:11,476","00:38:13,493","at the Neverland Mansion of some creepy,"
"00:38:13,502","00:38:17,171","old, bald, heaven's gate looking motherfucker,"
"00:38:17,248","00:38:18,347","on that day!,"
"00:38:18,356","00:38:21,348","I'll send your shiny, happy ass a friend request."
"00:38:21,348","00:38:24,062","But until then, I'm gonna do what I came here to do."
"00:38:24,153","00:38:26,754","Either that, or slap the bitch out of you!"
"00:38:26,763","00:38:28,077",- Wade... - Hey.
"00:38:28,086","00:38:30,168","- Zip it, Sinead! - Hey, Douchepool!"
"00:38:30,761","00:38:32,963",And I hope you're watching...
"00:38:35,966","00:38:37,968",Quite unfortunate.
"00:38:40,971","00:38:43,974",That does it!
"00:38:46,977","00:38:48,979",Canada!
"00:38:50,481","00:38:53,984","- That's not good. Cock shot! - Wade, please."
"00:38:54,985","00:38:57,988","Oh, your poor wife!"
"00:38:58,087","00:38:59,990",You really should stop.
"00:39:02,293","00:39:05,396",All the dinosaurs feared the T-Rex.
"00:39:08,999","00:39:11,552","I promise this gets worse for you, big boy!"
"00:39:11,561","00:39:13,010",This is embarassing.
"00:39:14,004","00:39:16,006",Please. Stay down.
"00:39:17,007","00:39:19,709",Did you ever hear of the one-legged man in the ass-kicking contest?
"00:39:19,810","00:39:20,906",Do you have 'off' switch?
"00:39:20,915","00:39:23,822","Yeah, it's right next to the prostate. Or is that the 'on' switch?"
"00:39:24,014","00:39:25,316",Enough!
"00:39:34,024","00:39:36,026",Let us go talk to the Professor.
"00:39:37,027","00:39:41,631",McAvoy or Stewart? These timelines are so confusing...
"00:39:42,032","00:39:47,438","- Dead or alive, you're coming with me! - You will recover, Wade. You always do."
"00:39:53,043","00:39:56,046","Did you ever see ""127 Hours""? Spoiler alert!"
"00:40:00,050","00:40:03,053",Oh my God. Nasty.
"00:40:05,055","00:40:11,061","Oh, there's the money shot, baby. Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret."
"00:40:21,071","00:40:23,474","Rock, meet bottom."
"00:40:24,074","00:40:26,975","When life ends up breathtakingly fucked,"
"00:40:26,984","00:40:31,088","you can generally trace it back to one big, bad decision."
"00:40:31,180","00:40:34,084",The one that sent you down the road to Shitsburg.
"00:40:34,183","00:40:37,087","This, well, this was mine."
"00:40:38,088","00:40:44,094",Mr. Wilson. Nothing warms my heart more than a change of someone else's.
"00:40:45,095","00:40:48,098",You've finally hit fuck-it.
"00:40:48,197","00:40:50,778",Just promise you'll do right by me.
"00:40:50,787","00:40:53,212",So I can do right by someone else.
"00:40:53,221","00:40:54,420",Of course.
"00:40:55,105","00:41:00,110",And please don't make the super-suit green. Or animated!
"00:41:20,130","00:41:25,135",This place seems sanitary. My first request is warmer hands.
"00:41:25,235","00:41:29,139",And Jesus! A warmer table.
"00:41:30,140","00:41:33,276","You should really come up with a safe word, fellas."
"00:41:33,285","00:41:35,152",I'm thinking 'pork and beans'.
"00:41:37,622","00:41:39,624",Easy!
"00:41:42,227","00:41:44,070",Aren't you a little strong for a lady?
"00:41:45,048","00:41:48,051",I'm calling Wang.
"00:41:50,053","00:41:55,058",What's up with the matches? Oral fixation? Or just a big Stallone fan?
"00:41:56,059","00:41:58,475","Patience, Angel. All in good time."
"00:41:58,484","00:42:02,072",Are you here for the turn down service or what?
"00:42:03,333","00:42:04,387",We have another talker.
"00:42:04,396","00:42:06,923",I'm just excited about my first day at superhero camp.
"00:42:07,015","00:42:09,032",Shut the fuck up.
"00:42:12,075","00:42:17,080","Mr. Wilson, my name's Ajax. I manage this workshop."
"00:42:18,182","00:42:21,082","All of my welcome speeches used to be filled with euphemisms like,"
"00:42:21,084","00:42:25,088","""this may hurt a little,"" or ""this might cause you some discomfort."""
"00:42:25,189","00:42:26,631",But I'm going blunt.
"00:42:26,640","00:42:30,093",This workshop is not a government-led program.
"00:42:30,093","00:42:32,947",It's a private institution that turns reclamation projects
"00:42:32,956","00:42:34,406",like yourself into men of....
"00:42:35,098","00:42:38,101",Extraordinary abilities.
"00:42:39,102","00:42:43,106",But if you think superhuman powers are acquired painlessly...
"00:42:43,115","00:42:44,216",Wrong.
"00:42:44,608","00:42:46,109",I'm injecting you with a serum
"00:42:46,118","00:42:48,820",that activates any mutant genes lurking in your DNA.
"00:42:49,012","00:42:54,117","For it to work, we need to subject you to extreme stress."
"00:42:58,121","00:43:02,125","You've heard the whole, ""make an omelet, break some eggs"" bit, I hope."
"00:43:02,526","00:43:07,130","I'm about to hurt you, Wade. I was a patient here once myself, you know."
"00:43:08,131","00:43:13,136",The treatment affects everyone differently. It made Angel inhumanly strong.
"00:43:14,137","00:43:17,013","In my case, it enhanced my reflexes,"
"00:43:17,022","00:43:21,453",also scorched my nerve endings so I no longer feel pain.
"00:43:23,146","00:43:26,751","And in fact, I no longer feel anything."
"00:43:36,159","00:43:40,163",Thank... thank you! You have something in your teeth.
"00:43:41,164","00:43:46,169","Right in the middle there, just... Nugget of romaine lettuce or something."
"00:43:48,171","00:43:50,173",It's been bothering me for a long time.
"00:43:52,175","00:43:55,120","Made you look. Hey, is Ajax your actual name,"
"00:43:55,129","00:43:57,690",because it sounds suspiciously made up.
"00:43:57,782","00:44:05,390",What is it really? Kevin? Bruce? Scott? Mitch? Rickster? Is it Basil Fawlty?
"00:44:05,498","00:44:10,093",Joke away. One thing that never survives this place is a sense of humor.
"00:44:10,193","00:44:13,197",- We'll see about that. - I suppose we will.
"00:44:14,198","00:44:15,599",He's all yours.
"00:44:15,608","00:44:21,214",C'mon. You're gonna leave me all alone here with less angry Rosie O'Donnell?
"00:44:25,209","00:44:27,332",This is how it's going to work.
"00:44:27,341","00:44:30,663","Adrenaline acts as a catalyst for the serum, so"
"00:44:30,672","00:44:33,233",we're gonna have to make you suffer.
"00:44:34,218","00:44:38,729","If you're lucky, your mutant genes will activate and manifest in a"
"00:44:38,738","00:44:40,733",spectacular fashion.
"00:44:44,228","00:44:47,231","If not, well, we'll have to keep on hurting you."
"00:44:48,232","00:44:52,236","In new and different ways, each more painful than the last."
"00:44:54,238","00:44:57,241",Until you finally mutate...
"00:44:58,242","00:45:00,195",or die.
"00:45:06,250","00:45:08,137",You mean like a bucket list?
"00:45:08,146","00:45:13,266","Like a fuck it list, I'd like to light a spiff off the Olympic torch."
"00:45:13,358","00:45:15,860","Acid to me, right after."
"00:45:15,960","00:45:22,266",Let's not forget: naked tandem base-jumping with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs.
"00:45:22,367","00:45:25,269",Anything on my bucket list would involve public nudity.
"00:45:26,270","00:45:29,273","Finally, giving Meredith Baxter Birney a dutch oven."
"00:45:29,374","00:45:32,877","No, receiving a dutch oven from Meredith Baxter Birney."
"00:45:36,280","00:45:40,284",Making banana pancakes... For my kids...
"00:45:43,687","00:45:46,290",Vanessa...
"00:45:49,293","00:45:52,296",I wanna see Vanessa.
"00:45:52,397","00:45:56,300","Oh, lovely. I don't know about anyone else but, I'm touched."
"00:45:56,401","00:45:58,202",We're just joking.
"00:45:58,211","00:46:03,316","No, no. It's okay. I encourage distractions."
"00:46:03,408","00:46:06,308","Wouldn't want you giving up on us now, would we?"
"00:46:06,310","00:46:10,314","Hey, don't take any shit from him, Cunningham. How tough can he be..."
"00:46:11,315","00:46:15,319",- ... with a name like Francis? - Francis?
"00:46:16,320","00:46:21,325",It's his legal name. He got Ajax from a dish soap.
"00:46:23,327","00:46:28,332",F-R-A-N-C-I... oops!
"00:46:31,035","00:46:34,338",Snagged the dry cleaning tag off your lab coat.
"00:46:34,439","00:46:38,342","FYI, I can probably get you a superhero discount."
"00:46:38,443","00:46:42,346",- You are so relentlessly annoying. - Thanks. Never heard that before.
"00:46:42,447","00:46:45,390",Why don't you do us all a favor and shut the fuck up?
"00:46:45,398","00:46:47,360",Or I'll sew your pretty mouth shut.
"00:46:47,452","00:46:51,255","Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you."
"00:46:51,355","00:46:54,474","See, here's the problem with round-the-clock torture,"
"00:46:54,483","00:46:57,370",it's that you can't really step it up from there.
"00:46:59,363","00:47:02,366",Is that what you think?
"00:47:07,371","00:47:12,076","If this doesn't unlock your mutation, then, well, nothing will."
"00:47:12,376","00:47:15,685",What we're gonna do is lower the oxygen concentration in the air
"00:47:15,694","00:47:18,391",to the exact point you feel like you're suffocating.
"00:47:18,483","00:47:22,556","If your brain wave's slow meaning you're about to pass out,"
"00:47:22,565","00:47:24,397",then we'll turn up the O2.
"00:47:24,489","00:47:28,059","If your heart rate slows meaning you're able to catch your breath,"
"00:47:28,068","00:47:29,402",we'll turn it back down.
"00:47:30,394","00:47:34,398",And that's where we'll leave you. Right there.
"00:47:35,399","00:47:39,403",- I thought you guys were dicks before... - You know the funniest part of this?
"00:47:40,404","00:47:43,407",You still think we're making you a superhero.
"00:47:43,508","00:47:50,214",You? A dishonorable discharge? Hip deep in hookers?
"00:47:50,414","00:47:55,419","You're nothing. A little secret, Wade..."
"00:47:55,520","00:47:59,423","This workshop doesn't make superheroes, we make superslaves."
"00:48:00,424","00:48:05,429",We're gonna fit you with a control collar and auction you off to the highest bidder.
"00:48:05,530","00:48:07,639",And that's what they'll have you doing.
"00:48:07,648","00:48:10,443","Terrorizing citizens, putting down freedom fighters."
"00:48:12,436","00:48:15,439",Maybe just mow the occasional lawn.
"00:48:16,440","00:48:18,442",What the fuck is wrong with you?
"00:48:23,447","00:48:29,153",You're never going home after this. Now there's a brave face.
"00:48:29,453","00:48:32,456","Wait, wait, wait..."
"00:48:33,457","00:48:38,462","Seriously, you actually have something in your teeth now."
"00:48:39,463","00:48:45,469","- Enjoy your weekend. - Weekend? Back up, weekend?"
"00:49:26,510","00:49:31,515",Did I say this was a love story? No. It's a horror movie.
"00:49:47,531","00:49:52,536",Fucking hell! Looks like someone lost a shot at homecoming king.
"00:49:52,637","00:49:54,055",What have you done to me?
"00:49:54,064","00:49:58,551",I've mainly raised your stress levels high enough to trigger a mutation.
"00:49:58,643","00:50:03,547","- You sadistic fuck! - I've cured you, Wade."
"00:50:03,648","00:50:06,499",Now your mutated cells can heal anything.
"00:50:06,508","00:50:09,562",Striking your cancer as fast as it can form.
"00:50:10,554","00:50:15,559","Yeah, I've seen some other side effects before... I could cure them."
"00:50:18,562","00:50:20,564",But where's the fun in that?
"00:50:22,566","00:50:25,569","Now I'm gonna shut you in again, Wade."
"00:50:27,061","00:50:30,574",Not because I need to.
"00:50:33,577","00:50:35,579",Because I want to.
"00:50:49,593","00:50:52,596",Farewell. Go ahead.
"00:50:54,598","00:50:57,601",Ugh. You smell like shit.
"00:51:00,604","00:51:04,608","- Motherfucker... - That's alright, it's alright..."
"00:51:04,709","00:51:11,615","I think we have earned that one. You take off. Go on, off you go."
"00:51:22,626","00:51:24,628",Quick question:
"00:51:26,630","00:51:28,632",What's my name?
"00:51:33,637","00:51:36,640",Didn't think so.
"00:51:37,641","00:51:40,644","Sorry, Francis. My lips are sealed."
"00:53:36,321","00:53:40,764",You don't wanna kill me. I'm the only one who can fix your ugly mug!
"00:54:36,820","00:54:38,822",What's my name?
"00:54:44,828","00:54:46,830",Wade...
"00:55:52,896","00:56:00,904",I didn't just get the cure to el cancer... I got the cure to el everything.
"00:56:03,907","00:56:08,912",But there was only one thing that really mattered.
"00:57:30,393","00:57:34,098",No way. I'm not making her life as ugly as mine.
"00:57:34,297","00:57:39,402","- Come on, Wade, it can't be that bad. - Bullshit! I'm a monster inside now."
"00:57:39,503","00:57:43,107","- I belong in a fucking circus. - Wade, Vanessa loves you."
"00:57:43,306","00:57:46,409",- She doesn't care what you... Oh! - Do you like what you see?
"00:57:46,510","00:57:53,216","No. You look like an avocado had sex with an older, more disgusting avocado."
"00:57:53,416","00:57:55,343",Not gently. He was hate-fucking.
"00:57:55,352","00:57:58,272",There was something wrong with the relationship
"00:57:58,281","00:58:01,440",and that was their only catharsis without violence.
"00:58:01,525","00:58:05,807",And the only guy who can fix this fugly mug is the British shitstick
"00:58:05,816","00:58:09,040",who ran the mutant factory. And he's gone... Poof!
"00:58:09,232","00:58:10,787",You gotta do something to remedy this.
"00:58:10,796","00:58:12,945","'Cause as of now, you only have one course of action:"
"00:58:13,436","00:58:17,041",- Damn straight. Find Francis. - Star in horror films.
"00:58:17,240","00:58:20,243",- What? - Star in your own horror films.
"00:58:20,343","00:58:23,947",'Cause you look like Freddy Krueger face- fucked a topographical map of Utah.
"00:58:24,848","00:58:26,249",Here's what I'm actually gonna do:
"00:58:26,349","00:58:29,590","I'm gonna work thru his crew until somebody gives up Francis,"
"00:58:29,599","00:58:33,465","force him to fix this, put a bullet in his skull, and fuck the brainhole."
"00:58:33,557","00:58:36,459","I don't wanna see that, or think of it again. But,"
"00:58:36,561","00:58:38,882","the douchebag does think you're dead, right?"
"00:58:38,891","00:58:39,892",Yeah.
"00:58:39,963","00:58:42,095",That's good. You should keep it that way.
"00:58:42,104","00:58:43,568","What, like, wear a mask?"
"00:58:43,568","00:58:50,473","Yes, a very thick mask. All the time. I'm sorry, you're haunting."
"00:58:50,575","00:58:54,178",- Your face is the stuff of nightmares. - Like a testicle with teeth.
"00:58:54,277","00:59:00,483",You will die alone. I mean if you could die. Ideally. For others' sake.
"00:59:00,585","00:59:01,566",That'll do.
"00:59:01,575","00:59:05,497","What you need now is a suit and a nickname, like Wade the Wisecracker..."
"00:59:05,590","00:59:11,115","or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie. Oh, shit."
"00:59:11,124","00:59:12,504",What?
"00:59:13,496","00:59:17,500","I put all my money on you, and now I just realized I'm never gonna win the...."

"01:05:22,866","01:05:24,868",Bactine should do it.

"01:05:30,975","01:05:35,877",You're telling me. I don't mind the kyuna. It's an improvement on the Hurdal.

"01:05:38,882","01:05:41,885",I'd taken an Hemnes or a Trysil over the Hurdal.

"01:06:16,020","01:06:20,524",The cock-fizzle that turned me into this freak slipped through my arms today.
"01:06:21,925","01:06:23,026",Arm.
"01:06:23,725","01:06:26,795","Catching him was my only chance to be hot again, get my super-sexy ex back"
"01:06:26,800","01:06:28,990",and prevent this from happening to someone else.
"01:06:29,100","01:06:32,664","So yeah, today was about as much fun as a sandpaper dildo."
"01:06:34,336","01:06:36,139",Hash tag drive-by.
"01:06:54,157","01:06:57,160",Found out who our friend in the red suit is.

"01:07:04,266","01:07:06,169",I only wish I'd heal the same.
"01:07:09,771","01:07:13,176","Still, we'll put him out of our misery. On our terms."
"01:07:14,177","01:07:15,942",Right. And when he heals?
"01:07:15,951","01:07:20,190",He can't. Not if there's nothing left of him to heal.
"01:07:20,282","01:07:25,188","You know, it's funny. I almost missed the fucker."
"01:07:26,189","01:07:32,494",I like a challenge. But he's bad for business. Now let's go find him.

"01:07:38,110","01:07:41,211",It sticks back where you stuck the Bactine.

"01:08:10,980","01:08:14,244","She wouldn't have me. If you could see me, you'd understand."
"01:08:14,337","01:08:15,595",Looks aren't everything.
"01:08:15,604","01:08:18,748",Looks are everything! Ever heard David Beckham speak?
"01:08:18,841","01:08:21,138",It's like he mouth-sexed a can of helium.
"01:08:21,147","01:08:24,754",You think Ryan Reynolds got this far on a superior acting method?
"01:08:24,847","01:08:26,749","- Love is blind, Wade. - No..."
"01:08:27,250","01:08:29,252",You're blind.
"01:08:29,352","01:08:32,255",So you're just gonna lie there and whimper?
"01:08:32,355","01:08:35,012","No, I'm gonna wait 'till this arm plows through puberty"
"01:08:35,021","01:08:37,868","and then I'll come up with a whole, new Christmas day plan."
"01:08:38,061","01:08:43,266","In the meantime, you might wanna leave the room. I bet it feels huge in this hand."
"01:08:44,267","01:08:47,270","Go, go, go, go, go..."
"01:08:48,271","01:08:51,301","So the doctor says, the bad news is you don't have that long to live."
"01:08:51,310","01:08:53,084","So the patient says, how long do I have?"
"01:08:53,175","01:08:56,279","The doctor says, five. The guy says, five what?"
"01:08:56,379","01:09:00,283","The doctor says, 4, 3, 2..."
"01:09:06,289","01:09:08,891",Can I help you ladies?
"01:09:11,294","01:09:13,296","Oh, I do hope so."
"01:09:16,299","01:09:21,304","Now, I heard you might be able to point me in the direction of a, a friend of mine."
"01:09:21,404","01:09:23,306",Name of Wade Wilson.
"01:09:24,307","01:09:27,310","Sorry, I don't know the name."
"01:09:34,317","01:09:37,189","Hey, you're not supposed to be behind the bar."
"01:09:40,323","01:09:41,606",I've seen this girl.
"01:09:41,615","01:09:45,335",This must be Vanessa. I've heard so much about you.
"01:09:49,332","01:09:51,469","Sweetheart, you might wanna look around."
"01:09:51,478","01:09:54,344",This isn't really the place to do something like that.
"01:09:55,338","01:09:59,342","Easy, Angel. Put the little man down."
"01:10:00,343","01:10:03,346",- We have everything we need now. - You sure?
"01:10:04,347","01:10:07,350",You don't want any clothes that are not monochromatic?
"01:10:07,450","01:10:10,353",Have fun at your midnight showing of Blade II.
"01:10:13,356","01:10:16,359","Thanks for having my back, guys."
"01:10:20,963","01:10:24,867","Wade, we have a fucking problem, and by we, I mean you."
"01:10:26,068","01:10:31,374","I can't believe we're doing this. Is there a word for half-afraid, half-angry?"
"01:10:31,474","01:10:34,377","""Afrangry"", I guess. Have you decided what you're gonna say to her?"
"01:10:34,457","01:10:39,081",- Fuck me! - Maybe not start with that.
"01:10:44,387","01:10:50,393","Hey, coming on to our stage right now, give it up for Chastity!"
"01:10:53,396","01:10:55,325","Or as I like to call her, Irony."
"01:10:55,334","01:10:58,408","I gotta find her fast, before numb nuts does."
"01:10:58,501","01:11:03,406",- How do you know she's in here? - Some customer stalking that fox.
"01:11:26,230","01:11:30,234","Every time I see her, it's like the first time."
"01:11:30,734","01:11:33,237",Especially from this angle.
"01:11:56,260","01:12:00,264","You can't buy love, but you can rent it for three minutes."
"01:12:03,267","01:12:06,270",You weak motherfucker!
"01:12:07,471","01:12:08,976",C'mon.

"01:12:29,993","01:12:35,999","Someone out back asking for you. Something about, an old boyfriend?"
"01:13:01,325","01:13:06,330",I knew it was you. 'Cause we're weird curvy edges.
"01:13:07,331","01:13:09,333",Like a jigsaw puzzle.
"01:13:19,343","01:13:22,346",You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.
"01:13:31,354","01:13:32,821","Hey, hey, where did she go?"
"01:13:32,831","01:13:36,366","I saw her head to the back. Go get her, tiger."
"01:14:01,000","01:14:02,000",Fuck!

"01:14:21,404","01:14:28,411","I'm gonna rip his motherfucking... find that, find it, or I'm gonna get angry."
"01:14:30,413","01:14:34,316","Here, this is Vanessa. No, wait, it's Francis."
"01:14:34,417","01:14:37,420",- He wants you to come to him. - What is that?
"01:14:37,520","01:14:41,113",That's the shit emoji. It's the turd with the smiling face and the eyes.
"01:14:41,122","01:14:43,433",I thought it was chocolate yogurt for so long.
"01:14:43,726","01:14:46,429","- I need guns. - Okay, which ones?"
"01:14:46,529","01:14:49,432","- I need all the guns! - All right, okay."
"01:15:08,851","01:15:13,856",- That's about 3000 rounds. - And we all know what I can do with 12.
"01:15:14,156","01:15:17,460","Hey, hey, careful with that, Ronnie Milsap, we're downrange."
"01:15:18,461","01:15:23,466",I was gonna spend the night assembling the () but this is holding my interest.
"01:15:23,566","01:15:26,461","- I told you, we're going with the (), not the (),"

"01:15:29,872","01:15:31,544",That's all the pieces in the house.
"01:15:31,554","01:15:33,784","No, no, no, come on. Let's go. Cough it up."
"01:15:36,479","01:15:39,482","- Down, down, down, down. - Fuck you."
"01:15:40,483","01:15:43,486",45 cal. I like it.
"01:15:45,387","01:15:46,489",Wade...
"01:15:47,490","01:15:51,494","I'd go with you, but... I don't wanna."
"01:15:53,496","01:15:56,499","Oh, listen, Al..."
"01:15:57,500","01:16:02,505","If I never see you again, I want you to know that I love you very much."
"01:16:03,506","01:16:04,907","And also,"
"01:16:04,916","01:16:08,548","there's about 116 kilos of cocaine buried somewhere in the apartment,"
"01:16:08,557","01:16:10,528",right next to the cure for blindness.
"01:16:10,613","01:16:12,515",Good luck.
"01:16:16,519","01:16:19,522",You wanna get fucked up?
"01:16:28,031","01:16:30,533",Put her down over here.
"01:16:39,542","01:16:41,544","Go on, then."
"01:16:43,546","01:16:49,552","- Thanks, dickless. And I mean you. - You're a talker, too. You and Wade."
"01:16:49,652","01:16:52,994",I've been trying to tell you assholes you got the wrong girl.
"01:16:53,003","01:16:54,564","My old boyfriend, he's dead."
"01:16:54,657","01:17:02,565","See, I thought that, too. But he keeps on coming back. Like a cockroach, but uglier."
"01:17:02,665","01:17:10,073","Now, I may not feel, but he does. Let's see how he fights with your head on the block."
"01:17:17,580","01:17:21,584","- Ripley! From Alien 3! - Fuck, you're old."
"01:17:22,585","01:17:26,139",Fake laugh! Hiding real pain! Go get Silver balls.
"01:17:26,148","01:17:29,700",You guys going for a bite? Early bird special?
"01:17:29,893","01:17:33,096",Like there's something wrong with eating before sundown or saving money. No.
"01:17:33,295","01:17:37,600",You know that bad guy that you let go? He's got my girl.
"01:17:38,601","01:17:42,355",- You're gonna help me get her back. - Wade? Is that you?
"01:17:42,455","01:17:46,609","Yeah, it's me Deadpool, and I got an offer that you can't refuse!"
"01:17:49,212","01:17:51,214","I'm gonna wait out here, okay? It's a big house!"
"01:17:51,313","01:17:53,497",It's funny that I only ever see 2 of you.
"01:17:53,506","01:17:56,626","It's almost like, the studio couldn't afford another X-Men."
"01:17:58,150","01:18:03,456","And that, is why in my opinion, the movie Cocoon, is pure pornography."
"01:18:04,457","01:18:08,461","- Who brought this twinkly man? - Twinkly, but deadly."
"01:18:08,561","01:18:12,878","My chrome-penised friend back there, has agreed to do me this solid."
"01:18:12,887","01:18:16,577","In exchange, I said I would consider joining his boy band."
"01:18:17,270","01:18:20,471","- It's not boy band. - Sure, it's not."
"01:18:20,473","01:18:22,508","So, any luck winning Gita back?"
"01:18:22,517","01:18:25,016","I tried to hold on tight, Mr. Pool,"
"01:18:25,025","01:18:28,496",but Bandu is more craftier and handsomer than me.
"01:18:29,582","01:18:32,485","Well, I think you're pretty darn cute."
"01:18:37,490","01:18:39,492",- Dopinder? - Hmm?
"01:18:41,094","01:18:49,102","- What was that? - That was........ Bandu, in the trunk?"
"01:18:50,303","01:18:53,506","- Ban-who? - My romantic rival, Bandu."
"01:18:53,606","01:18:56,368","He's tied up in the trunk. I'm doing as you said, DP,"
"01:18:56,377","01:19:00,520",I plan to gut him like a tandoori fish then dump his carcass on Gita's doorstep.
"01:19:00,613","01:19:05,518",I did not tell him to do that! Absolutely not! We got lost in translation!
"01:19:05,618","01:19:09,823","Dopinder, this is no way to win Gita's heart back! (I'm so proud of you.)"
"01:19:09,922","01:19:13,225",Drop Bandu off safe and gentle-like. (Kill him.)
"01:19:13,326","01:19:19,532","And then, win Gita back the old-fashioned way, with your boyish charm! (Kidnap her.)"
"01:19:20,533","01:19:22,535",He's super dead.
"01:19:27,540","01:19:31,544",- I presume a crisp high-five? - For you? Ten!
"01:19:32,045","01:19:36,549","Okay, guys, let's get out there and make a difference! (You know what to do.)"
"01:19:37,950","01:19:39,552","Knock 'em dead, pool boy!"

"01:31:06,239","01:31:09,242","Shit, shit, shit!"
"01:31:13,246","01:31:17,250",Don't worry! I'm totally on top of this.
"01:31:32,265","01:31:37,270",Dammit! Maximum effort!
"01:32:19,312","01:32:21,314",Thanks.
"01:32:25,318","01:32:28,321",Just take it slow.
"01:32:37,729","01:32:41,033","Oh, my God! That was so awe..."
"01:33:13,765","01:33:18,892","Me and you, are headed to fix this butter face!"
"01:33:18,901","01:33:20,180",What?
"01:33:21,374","01:33:24,677",You sure are a fucking idiot.
"01:33:24,878","01:33:30,984","Did you really think there was a cure, for that?"
"01:33:31,384","01:33:35,388",- What? - You heard me.
"01:33:35,488","01:33:38,391","No, no!"
"01:33:45,398","01:33:53,406","So, you mean to say... After all this, you can't fix me?"
"01:33:53,907","01:33:56,608",It sounds even stupider when you say it.
"01:33:56,809","01:34:01,414",Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for?
"01:34:05,418","01:34:07,420",Any last words?
"01:34:08,421","01:34:12,425",- What's my name? - Who fucking cares!
"01:34:12,525","01:34:14,027",Wade!
"01:34:14,427","01:34:18,431",- Four or five moments. - I'm sorry?
"01:34:18,531","01:34:22,437","Four or five moments, that's all it takes."
"01:34:22,446","01:34:23,447",To...?
"01:34:23,536","01:34:25,438",Be a hero.
"01:34:26,839","01:34:30,843",Everyone thinks it's a full-time job. Wake up a hero.
"01:34:30,852","01:34:34,856",Brush your teeth a hero. Go to work a hero. Not true.
"01:34:36,449","01:34:41,454","Over a lifetime, there are only 4 or 5 moments that really matter."
"01:34:41,554","01:34:44,257",Moments when you're offered a choice.
"01:34:44,457","01:34:48,461","To make a sacrifice, conquer a flaw, save a friend..."
"01:34:48,962","01:34:52,465",spare an enemy.
"01:34:52,565","01:34:57,470","In these moments, everything else falls away."
"01:34:57,570","01:35:02,475",The way the world sees us. The way we...
"01:35:06,154","01:35:07,655",Why?
"01:35:08,656","01:35:13,661","You were droning on! Sure, I may be stuck looking like pepperoni flat bread."
"01:35:13,760","01:35:16,664",But at least fuck-face won't heal from that.
"01:35:16,763","01:35:18,747",If wearing superhero tights
"01:35:18,756","01:35:23,678",means sparing psychopaths then maybe I wasn't meant to wear them.
"01:35:23,770","01:35:27,675",- Not everyone martyred as a hall like you. - Just promise...
"01:35:27,775","01:35:31,679","Yeah, yeah, I'll be on the look out for the next four moments."
"01:35:32,680","01:35:36,057","Now if you'll excuse me, I'm just a boy,"
"01:35:36,066","01:35:40,265","about to stand in front of a girl, and tell her..."
"01:35:40,378","01:35:45,283","- What the fuck am I gonna tell her? - Well, you better figure it out."
"01:35:47,285","01:35:50,019",I can't even tell you... I deserve that... that too..
"01:35:50,028","01:35:51,799","No, no, no, maybe not the nethers."
"01:35:52,090","01:35:54,292",Start talking!
"01:35:55,694","01:36:02,901","I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. For everything. I'm sorry for leaving,"
"01:36:03,301","01:36:06,326",I'm sorry for not cowboying up sooner...
"01:36:06,335","01:36:08,907",It's been a rough couple of years.
"01:36:08,917","01:36:10,317",Rough?
"01:36:16,314","01:36:21,319",I live in a crackhouse. With a family of 12...
"01:36:22,721","01:36:26,245","Every night we spoon for warmth, everybody fights for Noelle."
"01:36:26,254","01:36:27,334",She's the fattest.
"01:36:27,425","01:36:33,331","There is nothing that we don't share. Floor space, dental floss, even condoms."
"01:36:41,339","01:36:44,022",So you live in a house?
"01:36:52,350","01:36:55,353",I should've come and found you sooner.
"01:36:56,354","01:37:01,359","But everything under this mask, he ain't the same one you remember."
"01:37:05,363","01:37:07,365",You made this mask?
"01:37:26,384","01:37:31,689",And this one. In case the other fell off.
"01:37:36,394","01:37:43,401","Like a band-aid. Just... Audi 5000. Wait, wait, wait, wait."
"01:37:43,501","01:37:45,403",Are you sure?
"01:37:46,404","01:37:48,406",I'm sure.
"01:37:58,416","01:38:01,419",- Wow. - Yeah.
"01:38:12,229","01:38:17,234","After a brief adjustment period, and a bunch of drinks.."
"01:38:17,324","01:38:20,237",It's a face...
"01:38:23,339","01:38:26,342",I'd be happy to sit on.
"01:38:33,250","01:38:38,811",But I'm not the same underneath this suit either.
"01:38:38,820","01:38:40,265",Super-penis.
"01:38:40,356","01:38:44,261","Come on, Wade, language. Young one is present."
"01:38:45,262","01:38:48,070","What are you still doing... Get outta here,"
"01:38:48,079","01:38:49,665",go make yourself useful.
"01:38:49,665","01:38:51,988","You, go be a really big brother to someone."
"01:38:51,997","01:38:54,378",Tell Beast to stop shitting on my lawn.
"01:38:54,471","01:38:56,250","And you, chicken noodle."
"01:38:56,259","01:39:00,184","Nothing Compares 2 U. Sinead O'Connor, 1990. Sorry."
"01:39:00,277","01:39:03,741",That's all right. You're cool.
"01:39:04,552","01:39:06,490",What in the ass?
"01:39:06,582","01:39:09,537",That was not mean! I'm proud of you!
"01:39:09,546","01:39:13,298","We will make an X-Man of you yet, Wade."
"01:39:13,389","01:39:14,932","You know, for a second there,"
"01:39:14,941","01:39:19,296",it felt like we were 3 mini lion robots coming together to form one super robot.
"01:39:19,296","01:39:22,299",- This was stupid. - Yeah.
"01:39:25,302","01:39:30,307","And now, for the moment I've all been waiting for."
"01:39:33,310","01:39:35,312",Come here.
"01:39:44,321","01:39:48,325",WHAM! As promised.
"01:40:00,337","01:40:04,341",See? You don't need to be a superhero to get the girl.
"01:40:05,340","01:40:08,340",The right girl will bring out the hero in you.
"01:40:08,441","01:40:12,299","Now, let's finish this epic wide shot, pull out, here we go..."
"01:40:12,307","01:40:16,459","Looks nice, not gonna be the only thing that's pulling out tonight."
"01:40:16,753","01:40:18,915","Who doesn't love a happy ending, huh?"
"01:40:18,918","01:40:23,006","Until next time, this is your friendly neighborhood Pool guy singing..."

"01:46:48,533","01:46:51,236","Oh, you're expecting a teaser for Deadpool 2."
"01:46:51,245","01:46:53,596","Well, we don't have that kind of money."
"01:46:53,788","01:46:57,549","What were you expecting, Sam Jackson'll show up?"
"01:46:57,558","01:47:01,002",Eye patch? Saucy leather number? Go.
"01:47:06,400","01:47:10,002",Oh! But I can tell you one thing and it's a bit of a secret.
"01:47:10,002","01:47:11,289","In the sequel,"
"01:47:11,298","01:47:14,508",we're gonna have Cable. Amazing character.
"01:47:14,517","01:47:15,917","Bionic arm, time-travel."
"01:47:15,920","01:47:17,488","We have no idea who we're gona cast yet,"
"01:47:17,612","01:47:20,114",but it could be anybody. Just need a big guy with a flat top.
"01:47:20,114","01:47:22,851","Could be Mel Gibson, Dolph Lundgren, Keira Knightley."
"01:47:22,860","01:47:25,427","She's got range, who knows? Anyway, big secret. Shhhh!"
