"00:32:48,595","00:32:51,482","A Company, that our clients can trust."
"00:32:51,950","00:32:53,240","A firm, whose roots.."
"00:32:54,030","00:32:56,320","are so deeply embedded into Wall Street,"
"00:32:56,520","00:32:57,520","That our very Founders,"
"00:32:57,720","00:33:00,146","Sailed over n the Mayflower,"
"00:33:00,346","00:33:01,346","chiselled the name Stratton Oakmont,"
"00:33:02,020","00:33:03,720",right into plummet fucking rock.
"00:33:03,920","00:33:04,920",Got it?
"00:33:06,190","00:33:07,370",What we are gonna do is this.
"00:33:07,570","00:33:10,469","First we pitch them Disney, AT&T,"
"00:33:10,669","00:33:13,184","IBM, blue chips stocks exclusively."
"00:33:13,384","00:33:15,374",Companies at these peoples moan.

"00:33:16,774","00:33:19,544",We unload the dog shits.
"00:33:19,744","00:33:21,812","The pink sheets, the pennies stocks."
"00:33:22,012","00:33:23,012",Where we laid the money.
"00:33:23,410","00:33:25,424",50% commission baby.
"00:33:25,624","00:33:28,688","Now, the key to making money in a situation like this,"
"00:33:28,888","00:33:31,610","Is to position yourself now, before the settlement."
"00:33:31,810","00:33:34,570","Because, by the time you read about it in The Wall Street Journal."
"00:33:34,770","00:33:37,154",It's already too late.
"00:33:37,354","00:33:38,443",And you wait.

"00:33:53,357","00:33:54,813","They don't know, right? They gotta think about it."
"00:33:55,013","00:33:57,067",They gotta talk to the fucking wives. Or the fucking tooth fairy..
"00:33:57,267","00:33:59,147",The point is it doesn't matter what the fuck they say.
"00:33:59,347","00:34:02,184",The only objection they have is they don't trust you guys.
"00:34:02,384","00:34:04,479","And, why should they trust you? I mean, look at you.."
"00:34:04,679","00:34:06,278",you're a bunch of fucking sleazy salemen right?

"00:34:43,546","00:34:44,546","by being wrong, Stan. - I do wanna say that.."
"00:34:47,024","00:34:48,917",you sound like a pretty sincere guy.
"00:34:49,117","00:34:51,365",It's not gonna make you rich. It's not gonn make you poor.
"00:34:51,565","00:34:53,645","But, what Stratton..will do is serve as a..."
"00:34:53,845","00:34:57,369","Benchmark, for future business, Kevin. - You feel comfortable with me, Scott?"
"00:34:57,569","00:34:58,713","And, then you'll know for sure,"
"00:34:58,913","00:35:02,444",That you've finally found the broker on Wall Street that you can trust.
"00:35:02,644","00:35:06,344","And who can consistently, make you money."

"00:35:24,146","00:35:26,112","And, believe me..Kevin."
"00:35:26,312","00:35:28,927",The only problem you gonna have..
"00:35:29,127","00:35:31,360",is that you didn't buy more.
"00:35:31,560","00:35:33,523",Sound fair enough?

"00:41:05,865","00:41:07,823",Forbes had made me a superstar.
"00:41:09,340","00:41:14,024","Every day, dozens of money-crazed kids beat a path to my door."
"00:41:15,300","00:41:16,132","If we hired ‘em,"
"00:41:16,332","00:41:18,313",they dropped out of college overnight..
"00:41:18,513","00:41:22,571",and spend whatever allowance they had on a new suit from our Straten tailor.
"00:41:22,771","00:41:23,771",Are you fuckin' serious right now!
"00:41:25,084","00:41:27,971","I mean, we're literally putting clothes on these kids backs."

"00:41:34,750","00:41:37,770",There's always gonna be some asshole trying to drag him down.
"00:41:39,250","00:41:41,804","Within months, we doubled in size,"
"00:41:42,004","00:41:44,256",moved to even bigger offices.
"00:41:51,245","00:41:53,105","It was a madhouse, a greed-fest,"
"00:41:53,305","00:41:57,729","with equal parts cocaine, testosterone and body fluids."
"00:42:00,295","00:42:01,355",It got so bad.
"00:42:01,925","00:42:03,910","I had to declare the office a fuck-free zone,"
"00:42:04,110","00:42:05,110","between the hours of 9 and 7,"
"00:42:05,930","00:42:08,203",but i'm telling you even that didn’t help.
"00:42:08,410","00:42:11,050","Actually the madness started on our very first day,"
"00:42:11,520","00:42:13,435","when one of our brokers, Ben Jenner,"
"00:42:13,635","00:42:17,003",christened the elevator by getting a blowjob from a sales assistant.
"00:42:17,203","00:42:19,000","Her name was Pam and to her credit,"
"00:42:19,470","00:42:21,470","she did have an amazing technique, with this.."
"00:42:22,130","00:42:23,500",wild twist and jerk motion.
"00:42:24,500","00:42:25,731","About a month later,"
"00:42:25,931","00:42:28,042","Donnie and I decided to dowble-team her,"
"00:42:28,242","00:42:31,536",On a saturday afternoon while our wives were out shopping for Christmas dresses.
"00:42:32,010","00:42:33,850","Eventually Ben married her, which was.."
"00:42:34,370","00:42:38,134",pretty amazing considering she blew every single guy in the office.
"00:42:38,910","00:42:41,538",He then got depressed and killed himself three years later.
"00:42:41,738","00:42:45,189","Anyway, I hired my Dad Max to maintain order,"
"00:42:45,389","00:42:46,389",As the enforcer.
"00:42:46,510","00:42:48,530",Stratten's very own Gestapo.
"00:42:49,500","00:42:52,330","We called him Mad Max because of his hair-trigger temper,"
"00:42:53,070","00:42:56,520",which could be set off by something as innocuous as a ringing telephone.
"00:42:57,910","00:42:58,870",Who the fuck
"00:42:59,630","00:43:03,508",has the goddamn gall to call this house on a Tuesday night!
"00:43:04,730","00:43:06,759",Goddammit! - You're gonna miss it.
"00:43:06,959","00:43:08,904","Oh, please tell me something I don't know."
"00:43:09,104","00:43:12,964",I wait all week for the fucking <i>Equalizer</i>. And they have to fucking...
"00:43:13,460","00:43:17,522","Hello?... - Gene, how are you Gene? <i>But, as soon as he picked up the phone.</i>"
"00:43:17,722","00:43:19,471",<i>He'd affect this weird British accent.</i>
"00:43:19,671","00:43:20,570",right-eo.Gene that will be great...
"00:43:21,490","00:43:22,470",Cheerio. <i>It was absolutely...</i>
"00:43:23,100","00:43:25,700",The fucking half-wit! <i>..bizzare.</i>
"00:43:25,900","00:43:28,345",You missed it! <i>And He's Mad Max all over again.</i>
"00:43:30,410","00:43:32,090","Alright, tell me what happened. What happened?"
"00:43:32,290","00:43:33,290","Well, he discovered.."
"00:43:33,490","00:43:35,867",..it was his mother's sister. - Who is he? Who?
"00:43:36,067","00:43:38,506",The main guy. You know the main guy.
"00:43:38,706","00:43:41,538",It was his mother's sister. She showed up dead.
"00:43:41,682","00:43:46,602","<i>Of course, Mad Max didn't have to know everything we're doing at Straten.</i>"
"00:43:46,802","00:43:48,005","Then, there's a big target."

"00:44:09,824","00:44:12,148",They get confused and their wires get crossed.
"00:44:12,348","00:44:13,348",You gotta look like at the chin.

"01:29:52,890","01:29:54,825","I got whiskey, anykind of booze you want?"
"01:29:55,025","01:29:58,033","You know what, the bureau doesn't allow us to drink when we are at sea."
"01:29:58,233","01:30:00,523",Duh? Of course.
"01:30:00,723","01:30:01,723",Ever been on one of these before?
"01:30:01,923","01:30:03,798",A boat?

"01:30:16,108","01:30:17,361","Anyway, this is for you."
"01:30:17,561","01:30:20,341",It's a complete list of every person that was at my wedding.

"01:30:23,096","01:30:25,387","I figured this would help expedite the whole process, right?"
"01:30:25,587","01:30:26,587",There you go.
"01:30:26,787","01:30:28,887",Look. My point is that.
"01:30:29,087","01:30:30,743","I know you’re investigating Stratton,"
"01:30:30,943","01:30:34,143","but, for the life of me I can’t figure out why."
"01:30:34,343","01:30:36,581",I know we are a little unorthodox; We're a little...
"01:30:36,781","01:30:38,059",loud in the way we do things.
"01:30:38,259","01:30:41,817","You gotta understand, trying to make a name for ourselves."
"01:30:42,017","01:30:47,387","But, I want you to understand, we don't do anything illegal."
"01:30:47,587","01:30:49,352",Whatsoever.
"01:30:49,552","01:30:51,798","You could talk to the SEC, They're at my office,"
"01:30:51,998","01:30:54,289","fifteen times, over the last six month, so.."
"01:30:54,489","01:30:56,487",I got nothing to hide.
"01:30:56,687","01:30:59,590","You know, The SEC’s a civil regulatory agency."
"01:30:59,790","01:31:00,790",We pursue criminal activity.
"01:31:00,990","01:31:01,990",Exactly.
"01:31:02,510","01:31:03,510",You go after real criminal. Which...
"01:31:04,934","01:31:07,910","makes me wonder, what the hell you're investigating me for?"
"01:31:08,110","01:31:09,110","I mean, honestly. What.."
"01:31:09,190","01:31:13,118","What is it that you think, that we did or do. I don't get it."
"01:31:13,318","01:31:14,318","Well,"
"01:31:14,518","01:31:17,185","Jordan, I can’t discuss ongoing investigations."
"01:31:17,385","01:31:18,385","No, i get that. I understand."
"01:31:18,585","01:31:19,585",With that said.
"01:31:21,031","01:31:22,925",This case got dumped on my desk.
"01:31:23,125","01:31:24,125","You know, by a higher up.."
"01:31:24,325","01:31:27,473","Who needs to make a show of looking into the new company,"
"01:31:27,673","01:31:29,950",on the block. The whole press and everything.
"01:31:30,150","01:31:32,550",I end up being the smuck who does the looking.
"01:31:32,750","01:31:33,750",Exactly.
"01:31:33,950","01:31:34,950","It's just..you know, it bothers me."
"01:31:35,610","01:31:36,780",We are the new guy.
"01:31:36,980","01:31:38,669","we're the one that's banging on Wall Streets door, man."
"01:31:38,869","01:31:41,309",You should see what's going on at the bigger firm.
"01:31:41,509","01:31:42,509",I know all the information.
"01:31:42,610","01:31:43,660",It's true.
"01:31:43,860","01:31:45,926","Goldman, Leyman Brothers, Merrill."
"01:31:46,126","01:31:49,273",collateralized debt obligations? This internet stock bullshit?
"01:31:49,473","01:31:50,473","I mean, it's a fucking travesty."
"01:31:50,673","01:31:53,506","I mean, I could take you step-by-step,"
"01:31:53,706","01:31:57,465","to what exactly is occuring. You know, all you have to do is ask."
"01:31:57,665","01:31:58,665",I'm available.
"01:31:59,655","01:32:01,006",That's exactly what I wanted to hear.
"01:32:01,206","01:32:03,654","I don't see why, a little sit down like this."
"01:32:04,856","01:32:06,393",Can't be profitable for the both of us.
"01:32:06,593","01:32:08,954","It should, right? It should be profitable for us."
"01:32:09,154","01:32:10,154",It should. - Look?
"01:32:10,354","01:32:12,495","I'm gonna give you my personal line,"
"01:32:12,695","01:32:15,593",five days a week you just call me. Feel free.
"01:32:15,793","01:32:17,956",I'll do that. - Great.
"01:32:20,942","01:32:22,148",Are you sure you guys don't want something to drink?
"01:32:22,348","01:32:24,036","I mean, you're not hungry. Nothing?"
"01:32:24,236","01:32:26,098","Oh, no. - No?"
"01:32:29,137","01:32:30,064",Let me ask you.
"01:32:30,264","01:32:33,149","And if you don't wanna get too personal, just tell me to shut up at anytime."
"01:32:34,544","01:32:36,991",Did you try to get your broker's license at one time?
"01:32:37,191","01:32:38,191",Did I hear that right?
"01:32:38,391","01:32:40,330",Were you trying to take a stab at Wall Street?
"01:32:41,578","01:32:42,888",Who've you been talking to?
"01:32:43,088","01:32:45,276","Who the fuck have you been talking to? - Well, you're investigating me.."
"01:32:45,476","01:32:47,867",I hear things. You see what I mean?
"01:32:49,080","01:32:50,890","You ever think about, what would've happened."
"01:32:51,090","01:32:53,077","if you've..you know, stayed the course?"
"01:32:54,626","01:32:56,593","You know what. When I’m riding home on the subway,"
"01:32:56,793","01:33:00,031","And, my balls are fucking sweating. I'm wearing the same suit, three days in row."
"01:33:00,231","01:33:01,231","Yeah, you bet I do."
"01:33:01,431","01:33:03,144","I thought about it, before. Who wouldn't, right?"
"01:33:03,344","01:33:04,344","Right, who fucking wouldn't."
"01:33:04,544","01:33:06,467","I mean, you got.. another personal question."
"01:33:06,667","01:33:08,479","You don't need to answe.. - No, it's alright Jordan."
"01:33:08,679","01:33:11,521","What are you pulling? 50-60K something like that, a year?"
"01:33:15,596","01:33:16,556",Let's put it this way.
"01:33:16,756","01:33:19,425","You get a free handgun, when you sign up for the bureau."
"01:33:20,490","01:33:21,680","No. But, it fucking pisses me off."
"01:33:21,880","01:33:22,880","You know what I mean. You think about,"
"01:33:23,080","01:33:26,524","the people that build this country, hardworking people like you."
"01:33:26,724","01:33:29,064","You know,firefighters, teachers, FBI agents."
"01:33:29,264","01:33:32,889","End of the day, you guys get fucking skinned to life, financially."
"01:33:33,089","01:33:34,089",Fucking makes me angry.
"01:33:35,348","01:33:37,700",That's the one thing about Wall Street and this market is.
"01:33:37,900","01:33:43,010","For me, I feel, it's good to give back. You know, there's"
"01:33:43,210","01:33:45,299",there's situations.. where I can.
"01:33:45,499","01:33:48,366",make those situations better for people.
"01:33:48,566","01:33:49,566",You know.
"01:33:50,954","01:33:53,273","Opportunity, is everything."
"01:33:53,473","01:33:54,473",Exactly.
"01:33:54,673","01:33:57,073","Yeah, for example. I got this one kid, right."
"01:33:58,551","01:34:01,268",Went to school for environmental science or something like that.
"01:34:01,468","01:34:03,268",He was bogged down by student's loans.
"01:34:03,468","01:34:05,946","Turns out, his mother needed triple bypass surgery."
"01:34:06,146","01:34:07,146",Horrible situation.
"01:34:07,346","01:34:10,350","But, we got him in at the market at the right time."
"01:34:10,550","01:34:11,550",Choose the right stock.
"01:34:11,570","01:34:12,610",We gave him the right guidance.
"01:34:12,810","01:34:16,073","Boom. Overnight, changes his entire life."
"01:34:16,273","01:34:19,770","You know, he got to put his mother in the best hospital in New York city."
"01:34:19,970","01:34:23,197","It didn't work out for her, granted she passed away, unfortunately."
"01:34:23,397","01:34:26,138","But, we gave him that opportunity, you know what i'm saying."
"01:34:26,338","01:34:29,088","It's just about setting up the right team and then,"
"01:34:29,288","01:34:31,832","overnight, your life can change."
"01:34:37,208","01:34:38,947",What is..intern..uh..
"01:34:40,989","01:34:43,205",What does an intern make off on a deal like that?
"01:34:43,405","01:34:44,405",On that situation..
"01:34:44,605","01:34:48,146",On that particular trade. One trade.
"01:34:48,346","01:34:51,428",North of half a million dollars.
"01:34:55,599","01:34:57,373","And, I'd do that for anybody."
"01:34:57,573","01:35:00,910","You know, anybody that needs the proper guidence."
"01:35:20,410","01:35:22,482",Can you say that again?
"01:35:22,682","01:35:24,358","Just the way, you said it."
"01:35:24,558","01:35:25,558",Just the same way.
"01:35:30,892","01:35:31,755",I don't know what you're talking about.
"01:35:31,955","01:35:33,545",No..come on you know what i'm talking about.
"01:35:33,745","01:35:35,584","Just say the same thing. I think, what Jordan just did is he.."
"01:35:35,784","01:35:36,784",If I'm not mistaken.
"01:35:36,984","01:35:39,544",You just tried to bribe a Federal Officer.
"01:35:39,744","01:35:41,801","No, technically, I didn't bribe anybody."
"01:35:43,507","01:35:45,665","According to the US Criminal Code,"
"01:35:45,865","01:35:49,036",there needs to be exact dollar figure for the exchange of services.
"01:35:49,510","01:35:51,214",That would not hold up in the court of law.
"01:35:53,974","01:35:54,824","That's the truth, But.."
"01:35:55,024","01:35:56,519","I wanna tell you this, - Yeah."
"01:35:56,719","01:36:00,027","The same gentleman, that told me you tried to get your broker's license,"
"01:36:00,227","01:36:02,010",also told me that you are a straight arrow.
"01:36:02,210","01:36:03,210",He ran a security check on me.
"01:36:03,410","01:36:04,410",Well..
"01:36:06,414","01:36:09,945","i'm on a boat fit for a bond villain sometimes you need to play the part, right?"
"01:36:11,470","01:36:14,575",I think it's time you both get the fuck off my boat. What do you say?
"01:36:16,392","01:36:17,529","You know, Jordan. I'll tell you something."
"01:36:17,729","01:36:20,117","Most of the Wall Street jackasses I bust,"
"01:36:22,332","01:36:23,411",they were born to the life. - Is that right?
"01:36:24,864","01:36:26,157",Their father was a douchebags.
"01:36:26,357","01:36:28,302",Just like their fathers before them.

"01:36:40,945","01:36:41,945",Let me tell you something.
"01:36:42,145","01:36:43,925",Let me tell you something else.
"01:36:44,125","01:36:46,219","Honestly, i'm not bullshitting here,"
"01:36:46,419","01:36:48,234",this is one of the nicest boat that i've ever been on.

"01:37:07,264","01:37:09,882","I'm sure we'll be seeing each other, real soon. - I'm sure."
"01:37:10,082","01:37:13,559",Good luck on that subway ride home to your miserable ugly fucking wives.
"01:37:13,759","01:37:16,879",I'm gonna have Heidi lick some caviar off my balls.In the meantime.
"01:37:17,079","01:37:19,732","Hey, you guys wanna take some lobsters for your ride home?"
"01:37:20,125","01:37:21,880",You fucking miserable pricks! I know you can't afford them.

"01:37:51,630","01:37:54,180",It was ass covering time. I had to hide my money.
"01:37:55,110","01:37:56,340",Enter Rugrat.
"01:37:56,990","01:37:59,160",He knew Swiss Banker from law school.
"01:37:59,360","01:38:00,360","But, he was in Geneva."
"01:38:00,560","01:38:03,684","And there was no way, I'm gonna make that flight sober."
"01:38:05,440","01:38:08,897","So, I knew if I took my drugs right. I could sleep through the entire flight."

"01:38:30,663","01:38:32,640",and pretty much lost my motor skills.
"01:38:32,840","01:38:35,346",This was the drool phase.
"01:38:38,512","01:38:40,800",By ten I didn’t know who or what the fuck I was--
"01:38:41,000","01:38:42,610",The amnesia phase.

"01:42:35,420","01:42:36,420",Chit chat. Chit chat! Thank you.
"01:42:36,620","01:42:38,718",before business can be discussed.
"01:42:44,267","01:42:46,876","Of course, let’s get “down to it.”"
"01:42:47,076","01:42:48,076",What would you like to know?
"01:42:49,474","01:42:51,429",Under what circumstances would you be..
"01:42:51,629","01:42:53,903",..obligated to cooperate with an FBI
"01:42:54,103","01:42:57,918",or U.S. Justice Department investigation? For example.
"01:42:58,118","01:42:59,118",<i>Ca depend.</i>
"01:43:00,494","01:43:02,505",<i>Ca depend? - Oui.</i>
"01:43:03,754","01:43:05,898",<i>  Ca depend </i>on what? Exactly.
"01:43:07,086","01:43:09,984",Whether America plans to invade Switzerland in the coming months.
"01:43:11,554","01:43:13,330","So, check if tanks are rolling down the Rue de la Croix?"
"01:43:13,530","01:43:14,630","Yes, <i>Rue de la Croix</i>."
"01:43:30,458","01:43:35,042","<i>What I’m asking, you Swiss dick, is are you going to fuck me over.</i>"
"01:43:38,056","01:43:41,760","<i>I understand perfectly, you American shitheel.</i>"
"01:43:43,910","01:43:46,830",The only way the Banque Real de Geneve would cooperate;
"01:43:47,030","01:43:48,030",with a foreign legal body
"01:43:48,230","01:43:52,269",is if the crime being pursued is also a crime in Switzerland.
"01:43:52,540","01:43:56,982","But, there are very few Swiss laws which apply to your practices."
"01:43:57,182","01:43:59,722","From a financial standpoint,"
"01:43:59,922","01:44:02,784",you are now in heaven.
"01:44:02,984","01:44:05,047","See, I told you he's fantastic, right?"
"01:44:05,470","01:44:08,697","If the U.S. Justice Department sent us a subpoena,"
"01:44:09,200","01:44:11,747",it would become<i> papier-toillette</i>.
"01:44:13,591","01:44:15,423",We would wipe our ass with it.
"01:44:15,623","01:44:16,623","Unless, of course.."
"01:44:16,823","01:44:20,063",it was an investigation into stock fraud..
"01:44:20,263","01:44:23,192",which is a crime in Switzerland. If I'm correct.
"01:44:23,392","01:44:26,547","Then, there’d have to be Cooperacion."
"01:44:26,747","01:44:27,747","On your part, If I'm not mistaken."
"01:44:29,400","01:44:30,260","Yes, we would."
"01:44:31,580","01:44:34,355",Assuming the account is under your name.
"01:44:36,067","01:44:37,234",if it were..
"01:44:37,434","01:44:38,434",another name..
"01:44:40,086","01:44:42,550","A friends, Comerate, Cousin.."
"01:44:47,812","01:44:49,243",Relatives? Yeah.
"01:44:51,786","01:44:53,931",Was that yodeling I just heard or
"01:44:54,131","01:44:56,145",did you just say what I thought you said?
"01:44:56,345","01:44:58,629",Yes!  Yes!
"01:44:58,829","01:45:01,652",He's telling me to use a rathole.
"01:45:01,852","01:45:05,594","But, a U.S. rathole would never get into Switzerland with all that money."
"01:45:05,794","01:45:09,968",What I needed was a ratholr with a European passport.
"01:45:17,384","01:45:18,659",Jordan?
"01:45:18,859","01:45:21,735","Hey! How is my favourite Aunt, huh?"
"01:45:21,935","01:45:24,419","Welcome, was the traffic terrible? - No, not at all."
"01:45:29,030","01:45:31,360","Thank God, Aunt Emma didn't need too much convincing."
"01:45:32,220","01:45:34,150","Turned out, the british weren't too much different from the Swiss."
"01:45:34,350","01:45:37,402","Money talks. And, bullshit takes the bus."
"01:45:37,602","01:45:39,767",How do you say 'rathole' in British.
"01:45:39,967","01:45:42,187","If you get in any trouble, whatsoever."
"01:45:42,387","01:45:45,155",I'll come forward immediately. I'll say that I duped you.
"01:45:45,355","01:45:46,355",That I promise.
"01:45:47,784","01:45:50,325","Risk is what keeps us young, isn’t it darling?"
"01:45:54,657","01:45:56,211","Sometimes, I wonder"
"01:45:56,411","01:45:59,034","if you let money get the best of you, my love."
"01:45:59,234","01:46:02,744",Among other substances.
"01:46:07,066","01:46:09,023","It’s that obvious, huh?"
"01:46:09,223","01:46:11,591",It's chilly darling and you're sweating bullets.
