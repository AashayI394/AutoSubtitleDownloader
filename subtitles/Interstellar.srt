1
00:00:58,717 --> 00:01:02,717


3
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:17,203
My dad was a farmer.

4
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:21,270
Like everybody else back then.

5
00:01:22,926 --> 00:01:25,125
Of course he didn't start that way.

6
00:01:30,453 --> 00:01:32,607
The computer says you're too tight.

7
00:01:32,716 --> 00:01:35,568
No, I got this!
-Crossing the Straits.

8
00:01:38,345 --> 00:01:40,226
I've got to shut it down Cooper.
-Heyyy.

9
00:01:41,543 --> 00:01:44,279
Shutting all down...
-Hey, we do not have to shut down  anything!

10
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:49,339
Dad?

11
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:58,747
Sorry Murph. Go back to bed babe.

12
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,458
I thought you were the ghost.

13
00:02:03,017 --> 00:02:07,082
There's no such thing as a ghost babe.
-Grandpa says that you can get ghosts.

14
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:10,854
No, that's because
grandpa is too close to...

15
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:13,530
...being one himself. Go back to bed.

16
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,577
Were you dreaming about the crash?

17
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,465
Get your butt back in bed Murph.

18
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:48,068
The wheat had died.

19
00:02:48,179 --> 00:02:52,224
The blight came and we had to burn it.
We still had corn.

20
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:57,141
We had acres of corn.
But mostly we had dust.

21
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,317
I guess I can't describe it.
It was just constant.

22
00:03:02,428 --> 00:03:06,801
Just that, steady blow of dirt.

23
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:11,245
We wore little strips of sheet...

24
00:03:11,362 --> 00:03:16,312
...sometimes over our nose and mouth.
So we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

25
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,216
Well when we set the table we always
set the plate upside down.

26
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:24,938
Glasses or cups, whatever it was, upside down.

27
00:03:30,482 --> 00:03:34,570
Shake a leg. Murph, get your move on.
-One o'clock today, you and me...

28
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,146
...in the barn, Herbicide Resistance 101, check?
-Yessir.

29
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:41,059
Not at the table Murph!

30
00:03:42,081 --> 00:03:43,761
Dad, can you fix this?

31
00:03:45,164 --> 00:03:48,189
What the heck did you do to my lander?
-It wasn't me.

32
00:03:48,268 --> 00:03:51,945
Let me guess. It was your ghost.
-It knocked it off my shelf.

33
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:54,753
It also knocks the books off.
-There's no such thing as ghosts dumbass.

34
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:57,030
Hey.
-I looked it up, it's called a poltergeist.

35
00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:00,740
Dad, tell her.
-Well, that's not very scientific Murph.

36
00:04:00,853 --> 00:04:04,637
You said that science was about admitting what we don't know.
-She's got you there.

37
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,841
Hey, start looking after all our stuff.

38
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,580
Coop.

39
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,373
Alright Murph, you wanna talk science?

40
00:04:14,913 --> 00:04:18,846
Don't just tell me that you're afraid of some ghost.
No, you gotta go further.

41
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,079
You have to record the facts, analyze...

42
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:25,391
...get to the how and the why and present your conclusions.
Deal?

43
00:04:25,504 --> 00:04:27,765
Deal.
-All right!

44
00:04:29,626 --> 00:04:32,292
Have a good day at school.
-Hold up.

45
00:04:32,364 --> 00:04:36,636
Parent-Teacher conferences,
parent, not grandparent.

46
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,625
Slow down turbo.
That's not a dust storm.

47
00:04:43,731 --> 00:04:46,708
Nelson's torching his whole crop.
-Blight?

48
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:51,364
They're saying it's the last harvest for okra.
Ever.

49
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:58,147
He should have planted corn like the rest of us.
-Now you be nice to that Miss Hanley.

50
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,603
She's single.
-Well what's that supposed to mean?

51
00:05:00,713 --> 00:05:03,977
Repopulating the Earth.
-Start pulling your weight young man.

52
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:08,176
Why don't you start minding
your own business? Old man!

53
00:05:15,284 --> 00:05:16,767
All right Murph give me second.

54
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:21,771
Aha,....thirrrd.

55
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:26,707
Find a gear dumbass.
-Grind it! -Shut it Tom!

56
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:30,504
Whatcha do Murph?
-Ahh, she didn't do nothing.

57
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:34,172
Blew a tire is all.
-Murphy's Law.
-Shut up!

58
00:05:34,253 --> 00:05:37,076
Grab the spare Tom.
-That is the spare.

59
00:05:37,185 --> 00:05:40,278
Get the patch kit.

60
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:43,895
And how am I supposed to patch it out here?

61
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:47,372
You'll have to figure it out. I'm not always
gonna be here to help you.

62
00:05:54,874 --> 00:05:57,767
What's goin' on Murph?

63
00:05:57,842 --> 00:06:02,567
Why did you and mom name me after something that's bad?
-No we didn't?

64
00:06:02,641 --> 00:06:04,473
Murphy's Law?

65
00:06:05,847 --> 00:06:08,721
Murphy's Law doesn't mean that something bad...

66
00:06:08,831 --> 00:06:11,637
...will happen.
What it means is whatever can happen...

67
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:15,346
...will happen.
And that sounded just fine with us.

68
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:23,131
Get in.

69
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:25,838
Get in, let's go.

70
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:29,701
What about the flat tire?

71
00:06:32,347 --> 00:06:33,223
Yes.

72
00:06:47,437 --> 00:06:52,208
It is an Indian Air Force drone.
Solar cells could power an entire farm.

73
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,221
Take the wheel Tom.

74
00:06:58,482 --> 00:07:01,366
Go, go go!

75
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,075
Keep it pointed at that.

76
00:07:11,073 --> 00:07:14,007
Faster Tom, we're losing it.
-Yes.

77
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:15,956
Point right at it.

78
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:21,361
Hang on, here we go, here we go.

79
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:31,405
Nice driving Tom.

80
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,280
Dad?
-Almost got it, don't stop, don't stop.

81
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:45,332
Dad?!
Tom!!!

82
00:07:50,112 --> 00:07:52,092
Wha..? You told me to keep driving.

83
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:57,566
Well I guess that answers the ol'
'if I ask you to drive off a cliff' scenario.

84
00:08:00,344 --> 00:08:03,662
We lost it.
-No we didn't!

85
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:18,010
Wanna give it a whirl?

86
00:08:24,455 --> 00:08:25,391


87
00:07:41,735 --> 00:07:42,971


88
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,400
Let's land it down there,
right at the edge of the reservoir.

89
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:42,082
Nicely done!

90
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,975
How long do you think it's been up there?

91
00:08:47,053 --> 00:08:50,925
Delhi Mission Control went down
same as ours, 10 years ago.

92
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:53,701
So for 10 years?

93
00:08:56,615 --> 00:08:59,354
Why'd it come down so low?
-I don't know.

94
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:03,604
Maybe the sun cooked it's brain
or it was looking for something.
-What?

95
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:07,150
Give me that large flatblade
Maybe some kind of signal.

96
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:08,441
I don't know.

97
00:09:13,532 --> 00:09:15,073
What are you gonna do with it?

98
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:19,009
I'm gonna give it something socially
responsible to do...

99
00:09:19,044 --> 00:09:23,574
...like driving a combine.
-Can't we just, let it go?

100
00:09:25,151 --> 00:09:27,027
It wasn't hurting anybody.

101
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:33,172
Listen, this thing needs to learn how to adapt Murph,
like the rest of us.

102
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:40,989
So how's this work? Do you guys come with?
-I've got class.

103
00:09:41,067 --> 00:09:43,554
This one, needs to wait.

104
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:47,782
What did you do?
-They'll tell you about it when you get in there.

105
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:50,353
Well am I gonna be mad?
-Not with me.

106
00:09:50,462 --> 00:09:51,756
Just please, try not to.

107
00:09:51,872 --> 00:09:55,766
Hey, relax....I got this.

108
00:10:00,253 --> 00:10:03,647
You're late Coop.
-Yeah, we had a flat.

109
00:10:03,717 --> 00:10:07,684
And I guess you had to stop off
at Asian fighter plane store.

110
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:11,034
No actually sir, that's a, that's
a surveillance drone.

111
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:14,947
With outstanding solar cells. It's Indian.
-Take a seat.

112
00:10:16,535 --> 00:10:21,241
So, we got Tom's scores back.

113
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:26,074
He's gonna make an excellent farmer.
-Yeah he's got a knack for it.

114
00:10:26,183 --> 00:10:27,448
What about college?

115
00:10:27,566 --> 00:10:31,808
Well the university only takes a handful.
They don't really have the resources.

116
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,800
-I still pay my taxes.
Where does that money go? There's no more armies.

117
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:38,802
Well, they don't go to the university.

118
00:10:39,924 --> 00:10:41,655
Look Coop, you have to be realistic.

119
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:46,133
You're ruling my son out for college now?
The kid's 15.

120
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:50,788
Tom's score simply isn't high enough.
-What's your waistline?

121
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,650
How about 32, about 33 inseam?
-I'm not sure I see where you're getting at.

122
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,896
You're telling me it takes two numbers
to measure your own ass...

123
00:10:57,897 --> 00:11:00,348
...but only one to measure my son's future?

124
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,058
Come on, you're a well-educated man Coop...

125
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,407
...and a trained pilot.
-And an engineer.

126
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:11,264
Okay well right now, we don't need more engineers.

127
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:16,341
We didn't run out of television screens or planes;
we ran out of food!

128
00:11:16,453 --> 00:11:20,813
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers like you, and Tom.

129
00:11:21,004 --> 00:11:25,652
Uneducated farmers.
-We are a caretaker generation Coop.

130
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:29,473
And things are getting better.
Maybe your grandkids will get to be...

131
00:11:29,474 --> 00:11:30,196
-Are we done here sir?

132
00:11:31,465 --> 00:11:35,678
No.
Miss Hanley is here to talk about Murph.

133
00:11:35,754 --> 00:11:40,655
Murph is a great kid, she's really bright.
But she's been having a little trouble lately.

134
00:11:40,728 --> 00:11:45,100
She brought this in to show the other students.
The section on the lunar landings.

135
00:11:45,176 --> 00:11:49,631
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.
She always loved the pictures.

136
00:11:49,715 --> 00:11:53,633
It's an old federal textbook.
We've replaced them with the corrected versions.

137
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:58,477
Corrected?
-Explaining how the Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt...

138
00:11:58,512 --> 00:11:59,669
...the Soviet Union.

139
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,187
You don't believe we went to the Moon?

140
00:12:08,298 --> 00:12:12,693
I believe it was a brilliant piece of propaganda
that the Soviets bankrupted themselves...

141
00:12:12,728 --> 00:12:16,328
...pouring resources into rockets and other useless machines.

142
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:17,876
Useless machines?

143
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:21,864
And if we don't want a repeat of the
excess and wastefulness of the 20th century...

144
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:25,721
...then we need to teach our kids about this planet.
Not tales of leaving it.

145
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,421
Y'know one of those useless machines they used to make
was called an MRI.

146
00:12:30,531 --> 00:12:34,033
And if we had any of those left,
the doctors would've been able to find...

147
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:38,064
...the cyst in my wife's brain
before she died; instead of afterwards.

148
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:41,837
And then she would have been the one sitting here
listening to this instead of me...

149
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:46,604
...which would've been a good thing because
she was always the... the calmer one.

150
00:12:46,868 --> 00:12:49,851
I'm sorry about your wife Mr. Cooper.

151
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:54,404
But Murph got into a fistfight with several of her classmates...

152
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:56,809
...over this Apollo nonsense.

153
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:59,955
So we thought it would be best to bring you in
and see what ideas you might have...

154
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,765
...for dealing with her behaviour on the home front.

155
00:13:02,872 --> 00:13:06,536
Yeah, you know what,
there's a game tomorrow night.

156
00:13:06,691 --> 00:13:10,419
She's going through a bit of a baseball phase,
her favorite team is playing.

157
00:13:10,532 --> 00:13:12,089
There's gonna be candy and soda...

158
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,976
...I think I'll take her to that.

159
00:13:22,182 --> 00:13:26,980
How'd it go?
-I got you suspended.

160
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,247
What??
-Cooper.

161
00:13:30,323 --> 00:13:34,925
This is Cooper, go.
-Coop, those combines you rebuilt went haywire.

162
00:13:35,004 --> 00:13:39,651
Just reset the controllers.
-I did that, but you should come take a look.

163
00:13:59,978 --> 00:14:02,758
One by one they just teared off the fields
and headed over.

164
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,573
something's interfering with the compass.

165
00:14:05,687 --> 00:14:09,134
Magnetism. Or somethin' such.

166
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:56,003
There's nothing special about which book.
I've been working on it, like you said.

167
00:14:56,073 --> 00:14:59,344
I counted the spaces.
-Why?

168
00:15:00,897 --> 00:15:05,834
In case the ghost is trying to communicate.
I'm trying Morse.

169
00:15:05,911 --> 00:15:10,624
Morse?
-Yeah, dots and dashes. It's...

170
00:15:10,696 --> 00:15:13,020
I know what Morse code is Murph.
But I still don't think your...

171
00:15:13,034 --> 00:15:15,222
...bookshelf is trying to talk to you.

172
00:15:26,678 --> 00:15:31,104
Had to reset every compass clock
and GPS to offset off the anomaly.

173
00:15:31,257 --> 00:15:34,015
Which is?
-I don't know.

174
00:15:35,632 --> 00:15:37,850
Now if the house had been built
on magnetic ore...

175
00:15:37,923 --> 00:15:40,730
...we would have seen this the first
time we switched on the tractor.

176
00:15:42,866 --> 00:15:46,694
I hear your meeting at the
school didn't go so well.

177
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:53,182
You heard?
It's like we've forgotten who we are, Donald.

178
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:58,145
Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.

179
00:16:00,745 --> 00:16:04,882
When I was a kid, it felt like
they made something new everyday.

180
00:16:04,994 --> 00:16:08,121
Some gadget or idea.

181
00:16:08,231 --> 00:16:12,875
Like every day was Christmas.
But 6, billion people,

182
00:16:12,946 --> 00:16:14,864
Just try to imagine that.

183
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:19,219
And every last one of them
trying to have it all.

184
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,178
This world isn't so bad.

185
00:16:27,246 --> 00:16:30,548
And Tom will do just fine.
You're the one who doesn't belong.

186
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:33,318
Born 40 years too late
or 40 years too early.

187
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:36,779
My daughter knew it. God bless her.

188
00:16:38,112 --> 00:16:40,664
And your kids know it,
especially Murph.

189
00:16:40,773 --> 00:16:44,086
Ahh we used to look up to the sky and wonder...

190
00:16:44,895 --> 00:16:47,483
...at our place in the stars.

191
00:16:49,831 --> 00:16:51,774
Now we just look down,

192
00:16:51,883 --> 00:16:54,847
and worry about our place in the dirt.

193
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:57,397
Cooper, you were good at something,

194
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:01,071
and you never got a chance to do anything with it.

195
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,906
I'm sorry.

196
00:17:04,351 --> 00:17:08,320
You didn't expect this dirt
that was giving you this food...

197
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:12,222
...to turn on you like that and destroy you.

198
00:17:12,302 --> 00:17:17,212
In April I believe if I'm right,
15th of April I, I think.

199
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:21,671
This just happened at about 1:30 when that thing
came off the top of the canyon.

200
00:17:21,746 --> 00:17:27,025
In my day we had real ball players. Who're these bums?

201
00:17:27,135 --> 00:17:29,835
Well in my day, people were too busy...

202
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:32,247
...fighting over food to even play baseball.

203
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:37,149
Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural.
I want a hot dog.

204
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,567
School says you're gonna follow in my footsteps.

205
00:17:40,615 --> 00:17:43,679
I think that's great.
You think that's great?

206
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:47,570
You hate farming dad.
Grandpa said.

207
00:17:47,678 --> 00:17:52,320
Grandpa said huh?
Listen, all that matters is how you feel about it.

208
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:56,573
I like what you do.
I like our farm.

209
00:17:56,723 --> 00:17:58,706
And you're gonna be great at it.

210
00:18:11,585 --> 00:18:13,134
Let's get outta here.

211
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:25,138
All right it's a doozy.
Alright gang, lets mask up.

212
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:30,255
Tom, Murph? -Check.
-Check?

213
00:19:23,986 --> 00:19:26,198
Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?

214
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,543
Murph.

215
00:19:52,269 --> 00:19:57,117
The ghost.
-Grab your pillow.

216
00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:59,570
You're sleeping with Tom.

217
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:56,336
It's not a ghost.

218
00:21:01,656 --> 00:21:02,990
It's gravity.

219
00:21:04,907 --> 00:21:07,483
I'm dropping Tom, then heading into town.

220
00:21:07,596 --> 00:21:11,917
You wanna clean that up? When you've finished praying to it.

221
00:21:37,327 --> 00:21:39,917
It's not Morse Murph, it's binary.

222
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:42,441
Thick is 1, thin is 0.

223
00:21:46,185 --> 00:21:47,734
Coordinates.

224
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:05,911
That's it.
-I can't miss this.

225
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:08,572
Grandpa will be back in a couple of hours Murph.

226
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,627
But you don't know what you're gonna find.

227
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:17,542
And that, is why I can't take you.

228
00:22:23,382 --> 00:22:24,671
Murph?

229
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:30,081
Grandpa will be home in a while, tell
him I'll call him on the radio.

230
00:22:37,236 --> 00:22:40,195
Jesus!
What're you doing?

231
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:42,909
Oh d'you think it's funny? Huh?

232
00:22:42,983 --> 00:22:45,814
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.

233
00:22:47,794 --> 00:22:50,231
Make yourself useful.

234
00:23:53,203 --> 00:23:54,253
Hey Murph.

235
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,952
Murph.

236
00:24:00,628 --> 00:24:02,857
I think this is the end of the road.

237
00:24:05,264 --> 00:24:07,357
Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?

238
00:24:09,234 --> 00:24:10,604
That's my girl.

239
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,617
Step away from the fence.
-Don't shoot, don't shoot. I'm unarmed.

240
00:24:41,724 --> 00:24:42,981
My daughter is in the car.

241
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:50,223
Don't be afraid.

242
00:25:02,938 --> 00:25:07,150
How did you find this place?
-Where is my daughter?

243
00:25:07,264 --> 00:25:11,518
You had the coordinates for this facility marked on your map.
Where did you get those coordinates?

244
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:15,378
Where is my daughter?!
-Don't make me take you down again, sit down!

245
00:25:15,486 --> 00:25:18,434
Oh d'you still think you're a Marine pal?

246
00:25:18,545 --> 00:25:20,848
Marines don't exist. And you know what?

247
00:25:20,956 --> 00:25:24,662
I've got grunts like you mowing my grass.

248
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:28,848
Where did you find those coordinates?
-Unless you wanna end up as my second lawnmower...

249
00:25:29,498 --> 00:25:33,721
...no, I think I'll turn you into a valve of a vacuum or a dry cleaner.
No you won't.

250
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:37,686
TARS, back down please.

251
00:25:38,947 --> 00:25:42,018
You're taking a risk using
ex-military security.

252
00:25:42,136 --> 00:25:46,202
They are old and their control
units are unpredictable.

253
00:25:46,315 --> 00:25:48,219
It's what the government could spare.

254
00:25:49,776 --> 00:25:52,815
Who are you?
-Dr. Brand.

255
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:57,785
Yeah I knew a Dr. Brand once, he was a Professor.
-What makes you think I'm not?

256
00:25:57,894 --> 00:25:59,494
Wasn't near as cute either.

257
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:03,350
Please Dr. Brand, I don't have
any idea what this is.

258
00:26:03,463 --> 00:26:06,629
But I'm scared for my daughter,
and I want her by my side.

259
00:26:06,705 --> 00:26:09,228
You give me that, and I'll tell you
anything you want to know.

260
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,797
Take the principal and the girl
to the conference room.

261
00:26:15,989 --> 00:26:19,849
Your daughter is fine.
Bright kid.

262
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:24,461
Must have a very smart mother.
-It's pretty clear you don't want any visitors.

263
00:26:24,573 --> 00:26:28,878
Why don't you let us back up from your fence
and we'll be on our way, huh?

264
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:31,801
It's not that simple.
-Well, sure it is.

265
00:26:31,913 --> 00:26:34,899
Look I don't know anything about you.
I don't know anything about this place.

266
00:26:35,008 --> 00:26:37,239
Yes you do.

267
00:26:42,097 --> 00:26:44,003
Dad!

268
00:26:46,934 --> 00:26:48,230
Hello Cooper.

269
00:26:49,492 --> 00:26:50,718
Professor Brand.

270
00:26:52,056 --> 00:26:54,684
Explain to me how you found this facility.

271
00:26:54,762 --> 00:26:58,220
Kind of accidently stumbled upon it.
We were on a salvage run...

272
00:26:58,331 --> 00:27:00,851
You're sitting in the best kept secret in the world.

273
00:27:00,922 --> 00:27:03,757
Nobody stumbles in here, nobody stumbles out.

274
00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:08,698
Cooper, please, cooperate with these people.

275
00:27:08,843 --> 00:27:13,013
Well, it's kinda hard to explain.

276
00:27:13,087 --> 00:27:17,122
We we.., we learnt these coordinates...

277
00:27:17,123 --> 00:27:19,763
...from an anomaly.
-What sort of anomaly?

278
00:27:19,874 --> 00:27:23,699
I hesitate to term it supernatural
but it damn well wasn't scientific...

279
00:27:23,812 --> 00:27:28,650
You're gonna have to be specific
Mr. Cooper, right now.
-It was gravity.

280
00:27:33,605 --> 00:27:36,412
Um what sort of gravitational
an- where was this thing?

281
00:27:36,492 --> 00:27:39,908
Hey, I'm real happy that you're excited
about gravity bud, but...

282
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:44,478
...you're not getting any answers from us
until I get assurances.
-Assurances? -Yeah.

283
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:49,510
Like that we're getting out of here, and
I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

284
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:55,349
Don't you know who we are Coop?
-No Professor, I don't.

285
00:27:55,457 --> 00:27:59,059
You know my father Professor Brand.
We're NASA.

286
00:28:00,584 --> 00:28:03,079
NASA.
-NASA.

287
00:28:03,222 --> 00:28:05,744
The same NASA, you flew for.

288
00:28:15,134 --> 00:28:19,530
I heard they shut you down sir,
for refusing to drop bombs from...

289
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:22,048
...the stratosphere on the starving people.

290
00:28:22,266 --> 00:28:24,764
When they realized that killing other people...

291
00:28:24,765 --> 00:28:29,299
...was not a long term solution,
then they needed us back. In secret.

292
00:28:29,411 --> 00:28:33,930
Why secret?
-Because public opinion wouldn't allow
spending on space exploration.

293
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:36,765
Not when you're struggling to put food on the table.

294
00:28:36,874 --> 00:28:42,159
Blight. Wheat, seven years ago.

295
00:28:42,272 --> 00:28:45,434
Okra, this year.
-Now, there's just corn.

296
00:28:45,547 --> 00:28:48,145
And we're growing more than we ever had.

297
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:52,605
Yeah, but like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the dust bowl...

298
00:28:52,714 --> 00:28:57,397
...the corn will die. Soon.

299
00:29:02,475 --> 00:29:06,262
We'll find a way, Professor, we always have.

300
00:29:06,376 --> 00:29:11,164
Driven by the unshakeable faith
that the Earth is ours?

301
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,296
Well not just ours, no.

302
00:29:14,564 --> 00:29:15,824
But it is our home.

303
00:29:15,935 --> 00:29:20,475
Earth's atmosphere is 80% nitrogen.

304
00:29:20,584 --> 00:29:22,515
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

305
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:27,241
Blight does, and as it thrives,
our air gets less and less oxygen.

306
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:31,178
The last people to starve, will be the first to suffocate.

307
00:29:31,293 --> 00:29:33,577
And your daughter's generation...

308
00:29:34,476 --> 00:29:37,347
...will be the last to survive on Earth.

309
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:41,421
Murph is feeling a little tired, and was wondering
if she could take a nap in my office?

310
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:42,952
Yeah, thank you.

311
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:47,003
Okay.

312
00:29:47,147 --> 00:29:51,211
Now you need to tell me, what your plan is to save the world?

313
00:29:52,548 --> 00:29:56,169
We're not meant to save the world.
We're meant to leave it.

314
00:30:01,613 --> 00:30:06,194
Rangers.
-The last components of our one versatile ship in orbit.

315
00:30:06,274 --> 00:30:10,105
The Endurance.
Our final expedition.

316
00:30:10,214 --> 00:30:14,183
You sent people out there looking for a new home?

317
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:17,185
The Lazarus missions.
-Sounds cheerful!

318
00:30:17,292 --> 00:30:21,552
Lazarus came back from the dead.
-Sure, but he had to die in the first place.

319
00:30:21,662 --> 00:30:24,087
There's not a planet in our
solar system that could sustain...

320
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:27,569
...life and the nearest
star is over a 1000 years away.

321
00:30:27,604 --> 00:30:29,703
I mean, it doesn't even qualify as futile.

322
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,135
Where did you send them?

323
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:39,004
Cooper, I can't tell you any more
unless you agree to pilot this craft.

324
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,514
You're the best pilot we ever had.
-I barely left the stratosphere.

325
00:30:43,622 --> 00:30:45,925
This team never left the simulator!

326
00:30:45,998 --> 00:30:49,460
We need a pilot, and this is
the mission that you were trained for.

327
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:51,544
What, without even knowing?

328
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:56,649
An hour ago, you didn't even know I was alive,
and you were going anyway.

329
00:30:56,831 --> 00:31:00,785
We had no choice.
But something sent you here.

330
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,393
They chose you.
-Who's 'They'?

331
00:31:11,142 --> 00:31:15,213
How long, would I be gone?
-Hard to know.

332
00:31:15,325 --> 00:31:19,232
Years.
-I've got kids Professor.

333
00:31:19,343 --> 00:31:22,505
Get out there, and save them.

334
00:31:25,455 --> 00:31:29,190
Who's 'They'?
-We started detecting gravitational anomalies,

335
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:31,044
almost 50 years ago.

336
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:34,727
Mostly small distortions to our
instruments in the upper atmosphere.

337
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,004
In fact I believe you encountered one yourself.

338
00:31:38,116 --> 00:31:40,411
Yeah, in the Straits.

339
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:44,694
My crash, something tripped my fly-by-wire.

340
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:51,628
Exactly. But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this.

341
00:31:51,774 --> 00:31:55,692
Out near Saturn.
A disturbance of spacetime.

342
00:31:57,252 --> 00:32:01,389
Is that a wormhole?
-It appeared 48 years ago.

343
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:05,597
And it leads, where?
-Another galaxy.

344
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:10,060
A wormhole is not a naturally occuring phenomenon.

345
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:12,702
Someone placed it there.
-'They'?

346
00:32:13,962 --> 00:32:17,934
And whoever they are,
they appear to be looking out for us.

347
00:32:18,043 --> 00:32:21,179
That wormhole let's us
travel to other stars.

348
00:32:21,298 --> 00:32:23,452
It came right around when we needed it.

349
00:32:23,547 --> 00:32:26,688
They've put potentially habitable
worlds right within our reach.

350
00:32:26,832 --> 00:32:30,701
Twelve, in fact from our initial probes.
-You sent probes into that?

351
00:32:30,847 --> 00:32:34,381
We sent people into it, 10 years ago.

352
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,044
The Lazarus missions.

353
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:40,784
12 possible worlds, 12 Ranger launches.

354
00:32:40,785 --> 00:32:44,129
Carrying the bravest humans ever to live.

355
00:32:44,307 --> 00:32:47,084
Led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

356
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,361
Each person's landing pod
had enough life support for two years.

357
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:52,015
But they could use hibernation to stretch that...

358
00:32:52,124 --> 00:32:56,120
...making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

359
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,529
Their mission was to assess their world and...

360
00:32:58,606 --> 00:33:02,310
...if it showed potential, then they could send
out a signal and bed down for the long nap...

361
00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:06,743
...wait to be rescued.
-And what if the world didn't show promise?

362
00:33:07,135 --> 00:33:08,789
Hence the bravery.

363
00:33:08,898 --> 00:33:13,120
You don't have the resources to visit all 12.
-No.

364
00:33:14,699 --> 00:33:17,039
Data transmission back through the wormhole is rudimentary.

365
00:33:17,148 --> 00:33:20,030
Simple binary pings on an annual basis...

366
00:33:20,126 --> 00:33:24,823
...give us some clue as to which worlds have potential.
One system shows promise.

367
00:33:24,895 --> 00:33:27,192
Well one, that's a bit of a long shot isn't it?

368
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:30,796
One system with 3 potential worlds?

369
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,695
Not a long shot.

370
00:33:35,109 --> 00:33:38,924
Wait.
So if we find a home...

371
00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:45,889
...then what?
-That's the long shot.

372
00:33:46,047 --> 00:33:49,246
There is a plan A, and a plan B.

373
00:33:49,358 --> 00:33:53,278
Did you notice anything
strange about the launch chamber?

374
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:07,465
This entire facility is a centrifuge.

375
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:12,591
Some kind of vehicle? A space station?
-Both. The plan A.

376
00:34:12,706 --> 00:34:14,214
How do you get it off the ground?

377
00:34:14,397 --> 00:34:18,637
The first gravitational
anomalies changed everything.

378
00:34:18,784 --> 00:34:23,173
Suddenly we knew that harnessing gravity
was real.

379
00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:27,196
So I started working on a theory and we started...

380
00:34:27,267 --> 00:34:30,510
...building this station.
-But you haven't solved it yet.

381
00:34:30,656 --> 00:34:33,350
That's why there's a plan B.

382
00:34:33,534 --> 00:34:35,700
The problem is gravity.

383
00:34:35,847 --> 00:34:38,689
How to get a viable amount of human life
off the planet?

384
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:42,871
This is one way. The plan B.
Population bomb.

385
00:34:42,982 --> 00:34:47,217
Over 5000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

386
00:34:48,701 --> 00:34:52,834
How would you raise 'em?
-With the equipment onboard we incubate the first ten.

387
00:34:52,995 --> 00:34:56,615
After that, with surrogacy
the growth becomes exponential.

388
00:34:56,761 --> 00:35:00,789
In 30 years, we could have
a colony of hundreds.

389
00:35:00,902 --> 00:35:04,983
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

390
00:35:05,018 --> 00:35:06,154
This will take care of that.

391
00:35:06,335 --> 00:35:11,047
Yeah, but what about the people here?
You just, you'd give up on 'em?

392
00:35:11,191 --> 00:35:16,165
My kids?
-That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

393
00:35:18,191 --> 00:35:21,747
How far have you got?
-Almost there.

394
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,768
You're asking me to hang everything...

395
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,387
...on an 'almost'.
-I'm asking you to trust me.

396
00:35:31,978 --> 00:35:34,497
Find us a new home.

397
00:35:34,645 --> 00:35:39,096
And by the time you return,
I would've solved the problem...

398
00:35:39,422 --> 00:35:42,650
...of gravity.
I give you my word.

399
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,621
Go away!

400
00:36:07,494 --> 00:36:11,697
Murph.
-Go. If you're leaving just go!

401
00:36:14,188 --> 00:36:18,352
This world was never enough for you,
was it Cooper?

402
00:36:18,437 --> 00:36:22,892
What, cause heading out there is what I feel like...
...I was born to do?

403
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,883
And it excites me?

404
00:36:25,031 --> 00:36:29,352
Nah, it does not make it wrong.
-It might.

405
00:36:29,502 --> 00:36:33,295
Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

406
00:36:33,744 --> 00:36:38,324
The 'why' of the thing, that's the foundation.
-And the foundation's solid.

407
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:44,208
We farmers, we sit here every year when...

408
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:48,171
...the rains fail, and we say:
Next year.

409
00:36:48,318 --> 00:36:52,380
Well, next year ain't gonna save us, nor the one after that.

410
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:57,198
This world's a treasure Donald,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.

411
00:37:01,591 --> 00:37:05,721
Mankind was born on Earth,
it was never meant to die here.

412
00:37:08,866 --> 00:37:13,387
Tom will be alright,
but you got to make things right with Murph.
-I will.

413
00:37:13,702 --> 00:37:17,442
Without making promises you don't know you can keep.

414
00:37:26,975 --> 00:37:29,889
You have to talk to me Murph.

415
00:37:31,397 --> 00:37:34,779
I need to fix this before I go.

416
00:37:34,936 --> 00:37:37,408
Then I'll keep it broken so you'll have to stay.

417
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:44,513
After you kids came along, your mom, she
said something to me I never quite understood.

418
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:49,407
She said: Now, we're just here...

419
00:37:50,232 --> 00:37:52,572
...to be the memories for our kids.

420
00:37:57,214 --> 00:38:00,170
I think I now understand what she meant.

421
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,794
Once you're a parent, you're the
ghost of your children's future.

422
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:11,700
You said ghosts didn't exist.

423
00:38:17,743 --> 00:38:19,469
That's right Murph.

424
00:38:22,025 --> 00:38:24,469
Look at me.

425
00:38:26,947 --> 00:38:29,486
I can't be your ghost right now.

426
00:38:31,213 --> 00:38:33,223
I need to exist.

427
00:38:34,485 --> 00:38:37,249
They chose me.

428
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,282
Murph, they chose me. You saw it.
You're the one who led me to 'em.

429
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,779
And that's exactly why you can't go!

430
00:38:49,842 --> 00:38:54,819
I figured out the message.
One word. You know what it is?

431
00:38:54,929 --> 00:38:57,530
Murph.
-STAY.

432
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,954
It says STAY dad.
-Murph.

433
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:05,868
You don't believe me!
Look at the books. Look it says STAY.

434
00:39:05,986 --> 00:39:10,380
Why are you not listening? IT SAYS STAY!
-I'm coming back.

435
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:12,610
When??

436
00:39:24,692 --> 00:39:28,480
One for you.
One for me.

437
00:39:28,586 --> 00:39:30,493
When I'm up there in hypersleep,

438
00:39:30,687 --> 00:39:34,216
or, or traveling at the speed of light,

439
00:39:34,403 --> 00:39:36,856
or, near a black hole,

440
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,306
Time is gonna change for me.

441
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:42,620
And it's gonna run more slowly.

442
00:39:42,757 --> 00:39:45,742
So, when we get back,

443
00:39:45,927 --> 00:39:50,575
we're gonna compare.
-Time will run differently for us?

444
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:51,518
Yeah.

445
00:39:51,631 --> 00:39:55,769
Maybe by the time I get back,
you and I, we might be the same age.

446
00:39:55,918 --> 00:39:58,436
You and me.
What??

447
00:39:58,585 --> 00:40:00,024
Imagine that!

448
00:40:03,661 --> 00:40:07,731
Ah, Murph.
-You've no idea when you're coming back!!

449
00:40:09,217 --> 00:40:13,003
No idea at all!
-Murph.

450
00:40:14,297 --> 00:40:18,324
Murph, don't ma-, don't make me leave like this.
Murph!

451
00:40:18,506 --> 00:40:21,100
Don't make me leave like this Murph!!

452
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:31,882
Hey,...I love you.

453
00:40:32,065 --> 00:40:35,895
You hear me?
I love you forever.

454
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,407
And I'm coming back.

455
00:40:43,423 --> 00:40:44,905
I'm coming back.

456
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:05,370
How did it go?
-Fine.

457
00:41:05,485 --> 00:41:06,921
Just fine.

458
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:19,779
I love you Tom. -Travel safe, okay?
-Yeah. Take care of our place for me alright?

459
00:41:19,892 --> 00:41:23,146
Huh?
-Uh huh.

460
00:41:26,138 --> 00:41:29,527
Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?
-You mean your truck?

461
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,090
I'll make sure they bring it back.

462
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,661
Look after my kids Donald.

463
00:41:49,617 --> 00:41:53,282
Go for main engines. Start T minus 10.

464
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:57,993
Dad!
-9 -Dad!!

465
00:41:58,028 --> 00:42:02,467
8, 7.
-DAD!!!

466
00:42:03,265 --> 00:42:07,815
6, 5.
Main engines start.

467
00:42:07,928 --> 00:42:16,781
4, 3, 2, 1. Booster ignition, and.

468
00:42:24,885 --> 00:42:27,511
All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

469
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:35,064
Prepare for stage one separation.

470
00:42:35,217 --> 00:42:37,006
Stage one.

471
00:42:42,805 --> 00:42:48,199
Everybody good? Plenty of
slaves for my robot colony?

472
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:53,768
They gave him a humor setting,
to fit in better with his unit.

473
00:42:53,769 --> 00:42:58,460
He thinks it relaxes us.
-A giant sarcastic robot!

474
00:42:59,798 --> 00:43:03,791
What a great idea!
-I have a cue light I could use when I'm joking, if you'd like?

475
00:43:03,826 --> 00:43:05,025
That wouldn't be a problem, no.

476
00:43:05,135 --> 00:43:09,230
Yeah you could use it to find your way back into the ship
after I blow you out the air lock.

477
00:43:09,381 --> 00:43:12,270
What's your humor setting TARS?

478
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:15,276
100% -Let's bring it down to 75 please.

479
00:43:15,565 --> 00:43:18,229
Stage two separation.

480
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:31,519
All feeds going manual.
-Going manual.

481
00:43:33,789 --> 00:43:37,644
Deactivate probe heater 1, 2 and 3.
-Check.

482
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:46,100
Taking control.
-This is handover to you.

483
00:43:49,205 --> 00:43:51,683
ABF check. Over.

484
00:43:51,834 --> 00:43:56,378
Retro thrusters fuel cells 1, 2, 3.

485
00:43:56,413 --> 00:44:00,049
100%
ex-mites.

486
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:11,837
It's hard leaving everything.
My kids.

487
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:15,921
Your father.
-We're gonna be spending a lot of time together,

488
00:44:16,043 --> 00:44:19,601
-We should learn to talk.
-And when not to.

489
00:44:20,655 --> 00:44:25,478
Just being honest.
-Well you don't need to be that honest.

490
00:44:25,585 --> 00:44:30,010
Hey TARS, what's your honesty parameter?
-90%

491
00:44:30,155 --> 00:44:31,633
90%?

492
00:44:31,745 --> 00:44:35,273
Absolute honesty
isn't always the most diplomatic...

493
00:44:35,391 --> 00:44:39,022
...nor the safest form of communication
with emotional beings.
-Okay!

494
00:44:39,132 --> 00:44:41,478
90% it is Dr. Brand.

495
00:44:45,222 --> 00:44:48,532
We're coming up on the Endurance.
12 minutes out.

496
00:45:05,338 --> 00:45:07,605
Okay taking control.

497
00:45:10,888 --> 00:45:13,836
Approaching module port, 500 meters.

498
00:45:26,747 --> 00:45:28,655
It's all you Doyle.

499
00:45:46,023 --> 00:45:49,691
Nice and easy Doyle, nice and easy.

500
00:45:53,661 --> 00:45:57,481
Take us home.

501
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,815
Target locked.

502
00:46:06,961 --> 00:46:09,379
Target locked. -Well done.
-Okay, helmets on.

503
00:46:09,535 --> 00:46:10,433
Good job.

504
00:46:43,761 --> 00:46:46,799
The door is not charging.
Never mind!

505
00:47:09,842 --> 00:47:13,342
Cooper, you should have control.
-Control here.

506
00:47:14,429 --> 00:47:17,062
Communication with ring module active.

507
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,652
That's initiate.

508
00:47:40,213 --> 00:47:42,410
Are we ready to spin?
-Just a sec.

509
00:47:53,354 --> 00:47:56,410
Hello CASE.
-Hello TARS.

510
00:47:57,132 --> 00:48:00,804
Okay, we're all set.
-All right let's do it.

511
00:48:30,498 --> 00:48:32,048
30% of spin.

512
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:39,466
One g.

513
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:44,227
How is gravity treating you back there?

514
00:48:47,173 --> 00:48:51,143
Romilly, hey you okay?
-Yeah. -You all right?

515
00:48:51,254 --> 00:48:52,126
Yeah, no I just need a minute.

516
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:56,307
Okay, I think we have some dramamine
in the hibe pad, I'm just gonna go get that.

517
00:48:56,419 --> 00:48:59,690
It'll be in the cryo beds
Just be a sec. -Hey Brand?

518
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:01,321
Yeah? -Bring a lot.

519
00:49:09,771 --> 00:49:13,439
Amelia, be safe.

520
00:49:13,592 --> 00:49:17,720
Give my regards to Dr. Mann.
-I will Dad.

521
00:49:17,831 --> 00:49:22,791
It looks good for your trajectory.
We've calculated, two years to Saturn.

522
00:49:22,906 --> 00:49:24,711
That's a lot of Dramamine.

523
00:49:25,865 --> 00:49:27,880
Look after my family will you please, sir?

524
00:49:28,023 --> 00:49:31,260
We'll be waiting for you, when you get back.

525
00:49:31,801 --> 00:49:36,333
A little older, a little wiser,
but happy to see you.

526
00:49:38,316 --> 00:49:41,771
'Do not go gentle into that good night,'

527
00:49:41,962 --> 00:49:46,664
'old age should burn and
rave at close of day,'

528
00:49:47,963 --> 00:49:52,567
'Rage, rage against the dying of the light.'

529
00:49:53,771 --> 00:49:57,809
'Though wise men at their end,
know dark is right.'

530
00:49:57,955 --> 00:50:00,829
'Because their words had forked no lightning they'

531
00:50:01,013 --> 00:50:04,384
'Do not go gentle, into that good night'

532
00:50:04,966 --> 00:50:09,710
'Rage, rage against the dying of the light.'

533
00:50:33,361 --> 00:50:35,085
Here, pills.

534
00:50:37,896 --> 00:50:42,028
So alone.
-We have each other. Dr. Mann had it worse.

535
00:50:42,137 --> 00:50:43,436
I mean them.

536
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:49,050
It's a perfect planet and we're
not gonna find another one like it.

537
00:50:49,228 --> 00:50:53,579
No, it's not like, looking for a new condo.

538
00:50:53,729 --> 00:50:57,803
The human race is going to be, adrift.

539
00:50:57,949 --> 00:51:01,876
Desperate for a rock it can cling to
while it catches it's breath.

540
00:51:01,911 --> 00:51:03,569
We need to find that rock,

541
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:08,698
and our 3 prospects are at
the edge of what might sustain human life.

542
00:51:09,621 --> 00:51:13,902
Laura Miller's planet is the first.
Laura started our biology program.

543
00:51:19,294 --> 00:51:22,395
Wolf Edmunds is here.
-Tell me about Edmunds.

544
00:51:23,436 --> 00:51:25,844
Oh, um, Wolf's a particle physicist.

545
00:51:28,441 --> 00:51:30,206
Any of them had any families?

546
00:51:31,614 --> 00:51:34,515
No, no attachments. My father insisted.

547
00:51:34,704 --> 00:51:37,327
They'all knew the possibility of...

548
00:51:37,402 --> 00:51:40,330
...seeing another human being again.
I'm hoping we can surprise at least 3 of them.

549
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,741
Dr. Mann?
-Dr. Mann, well, he's remarkable.  He's the best of us.

550
00:51:44,921 --> 00:51:47,804
He inspired 11 people to follow
him on the loneliest journey...

551
00:51:47,889 --> 00:51:49,836
...in human history.

552
00:51:49,871 --> 00:51:52,238
Scientists, explorers.
That's what I love.

553
00:51:52,382 --> 00:51:55,404
Y'know out there, we would face great odds.

554
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:59,745
Death. But, not evil.

555
00:51:59,892 --> 00:52:02,228
You don't think nature can be evil?

556
00:52:02,373 --> 00:52:07,193
No. Formidable, frightening. But, no, not evil.

557
00:52:08,608 --> 00:52:12,495
Is a lion evil because it rips a gazelle to shreds?

558
00:52:12,647 --> 00:52:14,481
Just what we take with us then?

559
00:52:15,318 --> 00:52:19,349
Yeah. This crew represents the best of humanity.

560
00:52:19,495 --> 00:52:22,532
Even me, huh?
-Y'know what? We agreed, 90%.

561
00:52:22,675 --> 00:52:24,842
Don't stay up.

562
00:52:24,949 --> 00:52:26,114
I'll be in a minute.

563
00:52:26,273 --> 00:52:30,418
Just remember Coop, you're literally wasting your breath.

564
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:39,962
Hey TARS, let's go over that trajectory one more time.

565
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:44,886
8 months to Mars.
Gravity powered slingshot around,

566
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,345
14 months to Saturn.
Nothing has changed on that.

567
00:52:47,493 --> 00:52:48,970
Let me ask you something.

568
00:52:51,454 --> 00:52:54,692
Dr. Brand and Edmunds.
-Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.

569
00:52:56,568 --> 00:53:01,540
Dr. Brand and Edmunds, they close?
-I wouldn't know.

570
00:53:01,728 --> 00:53:04,613
Is that '90% wouldn't know' or '10% wouldn't know'?

571
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,812
I also have a discretion setting Cooper.

572
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:12,177
But not a poker-face slick.

573
00:53:23,663 --> 00:53:24,961
Hey guys.

574
00:53:25,108 --> 00:53:28,782
Dad's about to go down for the long nap.

575
00:53:28,928 --> 00:53:31,732
and I just, wanted to give you an update.

576
00:53:31,885 --> 00:53:35,745
The Earth looks amazing from here.

577
00:53:35,896 --> 00:53:40,035
You can't see any of the dust.

578
00:53:41,012 --> 00:53:44,432
I really hope you guys are doin', doin' great.

579
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:47,325
I know you're gonna get this message,

580
00:53:47,435 --> 00:53:51,855
Professor Brand assured me that he was gonna get it to you.
Alright, okay I love you!

581
00:53:53,336 --> 00:53:55,468
Is it him?
-I don't think so Murph.

582
00:54:02,058 --> 00:54:04,432
You must be Donald.

583
00:54:05,728 --> 00:54:10,314
Hello Murph.
-Why are you in my dad's truck?

584
00:54:10,465 --> 00:54:13,127
He wanted me to bring it for your brother.

585
00:54:13,275 --> 00:54:15,903
He sent you a message.

586
00:54:19,335 --> 00:54:21,275
She's pretty upset with him for leaving.

587
00:54:21,421 --> 00:54:24,802
If you record any messages I can
get them transmitted to Cooper.

588
00:54:26,244 --> 00:54:33,303
Murph is a bright spark.
Maybe, I should fan the flame.

589
00:54:33,338 --> 00:54:37,979
She's already making fools of her teachers,
well, maybe she should come and make a fool out of you.

590
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:42,513
So where are they?
-Heading for Mars.

591
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:47,014
The next time you hear from Cooper,
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

592
00:55:26,315 --> 00:55:30,376
They want me to repeat plant pathology.

593
00:55:30,523 --> 00:55:35,958
It sucks. But, they said I could start
advanced agriculture a year early.

594
00:55:36,424 --> 00:55:39,883
So...alright.
Well, I gotta go Dad.

595
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,145
Hope you're safe up there.

596
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:49,005
Sorry Coop, I asked Murph to say hi.

597
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:54,016
But she's as stubborn as her old man.
I'll try again next time.

598
00:56:09,278 --> 00:56:10,682
Are you okay Rom?

599
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:16,603
This gets to me Cooper.
This, this.

600
00:56:16,744 --> 00:56:20,200
Millimeters of aluminum protecting us
and then nothing...

601
00:56:20,346 --> 00:56:24,054
...out there for millions of miles, won't kill us in seconds.

602
00:56:25,134 --> 00:56:30,048
Did you know that some of
the finest solo yatchsmen in the world...

603
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:34,741
...don't know how to swim?
They don't know, and if they go overboard, it's done.

604
00:56:36,338 --> 00:56:38,578
We are explorers Rom.

605
00:56:39,918 --> 00:56:43,132
This is our boat.
Here.

606
00:57:10,163 --> 00:57:14,937
This is the, relay probe?
-In orbit around the wormhole.

607
00:57:15,051 --> 00:57:17,566
This is the wormhole and every
time we come around...

608
00:57:17,711 --> 00:57:21,416
...we would receive images from
the other side of the foreign galaxy.

609
00:57:21,527 --> 00:57:25,015
Like swinging a periscope around.
-Exactly.

610
00:57:25,129 --> 00:57:29,030
So we got a pretty good idea,
what we're gonna find on the other side, huh?

611
00:57:30,329 --> 00:57:31,982
Navigationally.

612
00:57:33,104 --> 00:57:36,705
Hey guys, looks like we're gonna be
approaching the wormhole in about three hours.

613
00:57:43,586 --> 00:57:46,721
Hey Coop, can we stop the spinning?

614
00:57:46,835 --> 00:57:50,790
Why? -Because we are close enough to see it.

615
00:57:52,304 --> 00:57:54,971
Aha.

616
00:57:59,191 --> 00:58:03,403
Look, that's, that's it! That's the wormhole!

617
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:06,473
Say it, don't spray it Rom.
It's a sphere.

618
00:58:06,619 --> 00:58:10,176
Well of course it is!
What you thought it would just be a hole?

619
00:58:11,226 --> 00:58:15,107
No. It's just that all the illustrations I've ever seen they...

620
00:58:15,272 --> 00:58:19,117
The illustrations, try to show how it works.

621
00:58:19,235 --> 00:58:23,439
So they say you want to go from here, to there.

622
00:58:23,593 --> 00:58:25,078
But this is too far.

623
00:58:25,261 --> 00:58:28,884
So a wormhole bends space like this so you...

624
00:58:28,919 --> 00:58:32,507
...can take a shortcut through a higher dimension.

625
00:58:32,618 --> 00:58:37,412
Okay so, to show that they've turned 3-dimensional space...

626
00:58:37,488 --> 00:58:41,785
...into 2 dimensions, which turns a wormhole in 2 dimensions...

627
00:58:41,804 --> 00:58:44,952
...a circle.
What's a circle in 3 dimensions?

628
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:49,314
A sphere.
-Exactly. A spherical hole.

629
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:53,439
But who put it there?
Who do we have to thank?

630
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:58,374
I'm not thanking anybody
until we get outta here in one piece Rom.

631
00:59:03,694 --> 00:59:06,791
Any trick to this Doyle?

632
00:59:08,168 --> 00:59:09,530
No one knows.

633
00:59:15,971 --> 00:59:18,814
The others made it, right?

634
00:59:20,584 --> 00:59:22,638
At least some of 'em.

635
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:57,491
Everybody ready to say goodbye to our solar system?

636
00:59:57,638 --> 01:00:00,223
To our galaxy.

637
01:00:01,779 --> 01:00:03,478
Here we go.

638
01:00:35,695 --> 01:00:39,152
Controls won't work here.
We are passing through the bulk.

639
01:00:39,264 --> 01:00:44,090
Its space beyond our 3 dimensions.
All you can do is report and observe.

640
01:00:54,008 --> 01:00:56,532
What is that?

641
01:00:57,806 --> 01:01:02,597
I think it's 'Them'.
-Distorting spacetime?

642
01:01:03,975 --> 01:01:06,279
Don't. Don't!

643
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:34,869
What was that?

644
01:01:37,255 --> 01:01:39,378
First handshake.

645
01:01:41,054 --> 01:01:42,322
We're...

646
01:01:43,405 --> 01:01:44,737
We're here.

647
01:02:05,707 --> 01:02:08,910
So the lost communications came through.
-How?

648
01:02:09,023 --> 01:02:13,985
The relay on this side cached them.
It's years of basic data, no real surprises.

649
01:02:14,966 --> 01:02:19,480
Miller's site has kept pinging 'thumbs up',
as has Dr. Mann's.

650
01:02:19,515 --> 01:02:23,319
Edmunds went down three years ago.
-Transmitter failure?

651
01:02:23,428 --> 01:02:26,313
Maybe.
He was sending the thumbs up right until it went dark.

652
01:02:26,462 --> 01:02:30,079
But Miller's still looks good though, right?
Because she's coming up fast.

653
01:02:30,191 --> 01:02:32,428
But there's one complication.

654
01:02:32,501 --> 01:02:36,577
The planet is much closer to Gargantua
than we thought.

655
01:02:36,648 --> 01:02:39,775
Gargantua?
-It's what we're calling the black hole.

656
01:02:39,925 --> 01:02:41,967
Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets both orbit it.

657
01:02:42,002 --> 01:02:45,194
And Miller's is on the horizon?
-Like a basketball around a hoop.

658
01:02:45,308 --> 01:02:47,915
Landing there takes us dangerously close...

659
01:02:48,091 --> 01:02:51,185
...and a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull.

660
01:02:53,298 --> 01:02:56,820
Okay I-, I could swing around that neutron star...

661
01:02:56,934 --> 01:02:59,485
-No no no, it's not that, it's time.
The gravity on that planet will...

662
01:02:59,632 --> 01:03:02,920
...slow our clock compared to Earth's,.. drastically.

663
01:03:02,955 --> 01:03:04,683
Well how bad?

664
01:03:04,794 --> 01:03:11,596
Well, every hour we spend on that planet
will be, uhh, seven years back on Earth.

665
01:03:12,927 --> 01:03:15,804
Jesus. -That's relativity folks.

666
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:20,204
Well, we can't just drop down there without...
-Cooper...

667
01:03:20,352 --> 01:03:22,790
We have a mission.
-Yeah Doyle, we have a mission.

668
01:03:22,896 --> 01:03:25,437
And our mission, Plan A is to find a planet...

669
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:27,978
...that can habitate the people
that are living on the Earth right now.

670
01:03:28,087 --> 01:03:30,714
You can't just think about your family,
now you have to think bigger than that, alright?

671
01:03:30,864 --> 01:03:33,809
I'm thinking about my family
and millions of other families.

672
01:03:33,891 --> 01:03:38,816
Okay, Plan A does not work, if the people
on Earth are dead by the time we pull it off.

673
01:03:39,686 --> 01:03:43,058
No, it doesn't.
That's why there's a Plan B.

674
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:49,225
Okay. Cooper's right.
We have to think about time as a resource just like...

675
01:03:49,335 --> 01:03:51,676
...oxygen and food.
Going down there is gonna cost us.

676
01:03:51,858 --> 01:03:58,048
Okay look, Dr. Mann's data is promising, alright,

677
01:03:58,192 --> 01:04:01,670
but it's gonna take us months to get there,
and Edmunds, it's even further.

678
01:04:01,705 --> 01:04:04,237
Now Miller hasn't said much.
But what she has said is very promising.

679
01:04:04,387 --> 01:04:07,141
It's water, it's organics.
-You don't find that everyday.

680
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:10,662
No, you don't and just think about
the resources including time...

681
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:13,038
...that would be spent trying to get back here.

682
01:04:14,526 --> 01:04:16,148
Romilly.
-Yeah.

683
01:04:16,183 --> 01:04:20,594
How far off of Miller's planet
do we have to be to stay out of the time shift?

684
01:04:20,629 --> 01:04:24,876
Alright, just back from the cusp.
-Which is here, just outside of Miller's planet.

685
01:04:24,992 --> 01:04:27,428
Alright. Okay.

686
01:04:27,547 --> 01:04:30,811
Here's Gargantua, here's Miller's planet.

687
01:04:30,959 --> 01:04:34,597
Instead of taking the Endurance
into orbit around Miller's planet, which would...

688
01:04:34,632 --> 01:04:37,443
...conserve fuel, but we'd lose a lot of time,

689
01:04:37,478 --> 01:04:42,016
what if, what if we take a wider orbit around Gargantua,
parallel with Miller's planet,

690
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:45,546
outside of it's time shift, to here.
Then we take the Ranger down,

691
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:48,565
we get Miller, we get her samples,
we come back, we analyze, we debrief...

692
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,421
...we're in, we're out, we lose a little fuel.
But we save a lot of time.

693
01:04:52,538 --> 01:04:54,442
That'll work.
-That's good. -There's not gonna...

694
01:04:54,593 --> 01:04:58,340
be time for monkey business or chit-chat down there,
so TARS, you should definitely stay here.

695
01:04:59,498 --> 01:05:02,135
CASE, you're with me.
Anyone else can stay.

696
01:05:02,282 --> 01:05:04,591
If we are talking about a couple of years,

697
01:05:04,786 --> 01:05:06,868
I could use the time to research gravity,

698
01:05:07,013 --> 01:05:09,499
observations from the wormhole,
that's gold to Professor Brand.

699
01:05:09,609 --> 01:05:13,903
TARS, factor an orbit around Gargantua,
conserve fuel, minimize thrusting.

700
01:05:14,018 --> 01:05:16,427
Make sure we stay in range
from Miller's planet. You got it?

701
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:19,759
I wouldn't leave you behind, Dr. Brand.

702
01:05:24,478 --> 01:05:28,101
You ready CASE? -Yep.
-You don't say much do you?

703
01:05:28,713 --> 01:05:33,009
TARS talks plenty for both of us.
-Detach.

704
01:05:39,889 --> 01:05:43,187
Romilly, are you reading these forces?
-Unbelievable.

705
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:48,622
A literal heart of darkness.

706
01:05:51,504 --> 01:05:55,777
If we could just see the collapsed star inside,

707
01:05:55,925 --> 01:05:58,798
the singularity, we'd solve gravity.

708
01:05:58,911 --> 01:06:02,265
We can't get anything from it?
-Nothing escapes that horizon,

709
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:06,317
not even light.
All the answers are there, just no way to see it.

710
01:06:06,469 --> 01:06:07,827
There's Miller's planet.

711
01:06:10,395 --> 01:06:11,357
Goodbye Ranger.

712
01:06:24,117 --> 01:06:28,549
This is fast for atmospheric entry.
Shouldn't we use the thrusters to slow?

713
01:06:28,629 --> 01:06:32,710
-No.
I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics to save some fuel.

714
01:06:32,819 --> 01:06:35,849
Air-brake?
-We wanna get down fast don't we?

715
01:06:35,957 --> 01:06:39,352
Actually we wanna get there in one piece.
-Hang on.

716
01:06:39,425 --> 01:06:41,110
Brand, Doyle, get ready.

717
01:06:56,945 --> 01:06:59,677
We should be using the air-brake.
-Hands up CASE.

718
01:06:59,757 --> 01:07:03,176
The only time I ever went down is
when a machine was easing at the wrong time.

719
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:06,406
You're going to get us killed.
-Just like reckless driving.

720
01:07:06,682 --> 01:07:08,323
We're too fast. -I got this.

721
01:07:13,055 --> 01:07:17,126
Should I get ready to detach?
-No. I need to feel the air.

722
01:07:21,131 --> 01:07:22,326
Here we go.

723
01:07:23,771 --> 01:07:26,574
It's just water!

724
01:07:26,683 --> 01:07:31,430
The stuff of life.
-1200 meters.

725
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:34,622
Do we have a fix on her beacon?
-That I have, can you maneuver?

726
01:07:34,731 --> 01:07:39,534
I gonna need to shave some speed.
I'm gonna spiral down on top of it, everybody hang on!

727
01:07:40,941 --> 01:07:42,855
700.

728
01:07:44,801 --> 01:07:47,154
On my cue CASE, on my cue.

729
01:07:49,988 --> 01:07:51,429
500 meters.

730
01:08:00,614 --> 01:08:02,056
Now!

731
01:08:16,132 --> 01:08:17,381
Very graceful.

732
01:08:17,451 --> 01:08:21,873
No, but very efficient.

733
01:08:23,331 --> 01:08:26,081
What're you waiting for?
Let's go.

734
01:08:26,151 --> 01:08:29,862
Go, go, go, go.
7 years per hour here.

735
01:08:29,969 --> 01:08:31,262
Let's make it count.

736
01:08:57,449 --> 01:08:58,336
This way.

737
01:09:00,965 --> 01:09:03,055
About 200 meters.

738
01:09:13,062 --> 01:09:17,664
Gravity's punishing.
-Been floating through space too long?

739
01:09:17,777 --> 01:09:20,078
130% Earth's gravity.

740
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:22,834
Come on, come on, come on.

741
01:09:24,996 --> 01:09:27,407
There's nothing here.
-should be right here.

742
01:09:29,075 --> 01:09:32,537
If the, if the signal's coming from here, then...

743
01:09:41,939 --> 01:09:43,128
Her beacon.

744
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:54,360
Wreckage.
-Where's the rest?

745
01:09:54,433 --> 01:09:56,165
Towards the mountains.

746
01:09:59,483 --> 01:10:01,533
Those aren't mountains.

747
01:10:04,048 --> 01:10:06,395
They're waves.
-What?

748
01:10:09,894 --> 01:10:11,372
Shit.

749
01:10:13,467 --> 01:10:15,588
That one's moving away from us.

750
01:10:20,665 --> 01:10:23,433
We need the recorder.

751
01:10:33,625 --> 01:10:36,326
Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!

752
01:10:36,404 --> 01:10:38,674
I'm not, leaving, without, her data.

753
01:10:40,012 --> 01:10:44,278
Get back here now. We do not have time.
The second wave is coming!

754
01:10:44,391 --> 01:10:46,866
We are in the middle of a swell!

755
01:10:46,975 --> 01:10:50,752
Get your ass back to the Ranger now!

756
01:10:54,285 --> 01:10:57,591
Brand get back here now!!

757
01:10:59,026 --> 01:11:02,937
Cooper, go, Cooper go, I can't make it. Go!

758
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,270
CASE, go get her.

759
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,634
GO!
-Get up, get up Brand.

760
01:11:11,779 --> 01:11:13,494
Go go, go.

761
01:11:14,686 --> 01:11:18,350
I'm not gonna make it!
-Yes you are. Yes you are!

762
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:27,573
Come on CASE has her, CASE has her! Get back here Doyle!

763
01:11:30,346 --> 01:11:31,821
Dr. Brand.

764
01:11:33,515 --> 01:11:35,275
To the hatch.

765
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,302
Go, go. Go.

766
01:11:46,824 --> 01:11:50,861
Manually overriding inside hatch!

767
01:11:54,208 --> 01:11:58,918
Cooper don't!
Cooper don't!

768
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:00,152
Cooper!

769
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:05,848
Engines are flooded!
I'll have to shut it down!

770
01:12:38,989 --> 01:12:40,644
Oh shit!!

771
01:12:45,428 --> 01:12:46,761
Whoaa!

772
01:13:17,867 --> 01:13:21,064
CASE what's wrong?
-Chute's waterlogged, let it drain.

773
01:13:21,895 --> 01:13:25,457
Goddamn it!!
I told you to leave me.

774
01:13:25,569 --> 01:13:27,974
-And I told you to get your ass back here!

775
01:13:28,048 --> 01:13:31,669
The difference is that one of
us was thinkin' about the mission.

776
01:13:31,778 --> 01:13:33,619
-You were thinking about getting home!!

777
01:13:34,642 --> 01:13:39,614
I was trying to do the right thing!
-Can you tell that to Doyle?

778
01:13:41,551 --> 01:13:44,504
CASE, how much time?
-45 to an hour.

779
01:13:45,911 --> 01:13:47,626
The stuff of life huh?

780
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:51,610
What's this gonna cost us Brand?
-A lot.

781
01:13:52,493 --> 01:13:53,308
Decades.

782
01:14:00,503 --> 01:14:03,384
What happened to Miller?
-Judging by...

783
01:14:03,499 --> 01:14:07,307
...the wreckage she was
broken up by a wave soon after impact.

784
01:14:07,417 --> 01:14:10,878
How's the hell the wreckage stayed together
after all these years, huh?

785
01:14:12,141 --> 01:14:13,722
Because of the time slippage.

786
01:14:13,869 --> 01:14:17,491
On this planet's time she,

787
01:14:17,603 --> 01:14:19,624
she's landed hours ago, she...

788
01:14:19,699 --> 01:14:22,653
...she probably just died minutes ago.

789
01:14:22,764 --> 01:14:26,609
The data Doyle received was just the initial
status echoing endlessly.

790
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:29,092
Oh we are not prepared for this.

791
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:35,784
You eggheads have the survival skills
of a boy-scout troop.

792
01:14:35,816 --> 01:14:38,904
Well we got this far on our brains,
farther than any human in history.

793
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:43,573
Well not far enough.
And now we're stuck here till there won't be anyone...

794
01:14:43,574 --> 01:14:44,760
...left on Earth to save.

795
01:14:46,683 --> 01:14:50,242
I'm counting every minute same as you Cooper.

796
01:14:53,993 --> 01:14:58,875
Is there any possibility?
I dunno, maybe some way, I don't know...

797
01:14:58,876 --> 01:15:03,000
...maybe if we could jump in a black hole
and gain back the years?

798
01:14:14,502 --> 01:14:17,857
Don't shake your head at me!
Time is relative, okay.

799
01:15:06,965 --> 01:15:09,212
It can stretch and it can squeeze, but,

800
01:15:09,282 --> 01:15:13,031
it can't run backwards!
Just can't!

801
01:15:13,109 --> 01:15:17,300
The only thing that can move across dimensions,
like time, is gravity.

802
01:15:19,612 --> 01:15:20,939
Okay.

803
01:15:22,809 --> 01:15:25,508
The beings that led us here,

804
01:15:25,619 --> 01:15:28,712
they communicate through gravity, right?

805
01:15:28,863 --> 01:15:32,786
Could they be talking to us from the future?
-Maybe.

806
01:15:32,899 --> 01:15:36,403
Okay, if they can..?
They...

807
01:15:36,518 --> 01:15:39,171
...are beings of 5 dimensions!

808
01:15:39,288 --> 01:15:42,904
Right, to them, time might be
yet another physical dimension.

809
01:15:42,991 --> 01:15:47,532
To them, the past might be a canyon
they can climb into,

810
01:15:47,638 --> 01:15:52,360
and the future, a mountain that they can climb up,
but to us, it's not! Okay!

811
01:15:52,435 --> 01:15:56,376
Look Cooper, I screwed up.
I'm sorry.

812
01:15:57,674 --> 01:15:59,721
But you knew about relativity.

813
01:16:02,533 --> 01:16:03,509
Brand.

814
01:16:07,627 --> 01:16:10,586
My daughter is 10 years old.

815
01:16:10,701 --> 01:16:13,962
Couldn't teach her Einstein's theories before I left,

816
01:16:13,997 --> 01:16:18,643
Couldn't you have told your daughter
that you were going to save the world?
-No.

817
01:16:19,768 --> 01:16:24,476
When you become a parent,
one thing becomes really clear,

818
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:29,273
And that's you wanna make sure your children feel safe,

819
01:16:30,281 --> 01:16:34,101
and it rules out telling a 10 year old,
that the world's endin'.

820
01:16:36,416 --> 01:16:37,421
Cooper.

821
01:16:41,141 --> 01:16:44,543
How long for the engines CASE?
-A minute or two.

822
01:16:44,618 --> 01:16:46,790
Well we don't have it!
Helmets on!!

823
01:16:50,473 --> 01:16:55,283
Brand, co-pilot you're up.
CASE, run the cabin oxygen through the main thrusters.

824
01:16:55,394 --> 01:16:57,346
We're gonna spark it!
-Roger that.

825
01:16:57,459 --> 01:16:58,658
Depressurizing.

826
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:05,172
Engines up!

827
01:17:34,169 --> 01:17:38,086
Hello Rom!
-I've waited years.

828
01:17:39,236 --> 01:17:40,807
How many, how many years?

829
01:17:42,444 --> 01:17:47,416
By now it must be,
23 years, 4 months, 8 days.

830
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:52,461
Doyle?

831
01:17:59,562 --> 01:18:02,914
I thought I was prepared...I knew the theory...

832
01:18:02,985 --> 01:18:05,501
...reality is different.

833
01:18:06,518 --> 01:18:07,373
And Miller?

834
01:18:08,678 --> 01:18:10,548
There's nothing here for us.

835
01:18:14,229 --> 01:18:18,077
Why didn't you sleep?
-Oh I had a couple of stretches.

836
01:18:18,150 --> 01:18:21,037
I stopped believing that you were coming back.

837
01:18:21,116 --> 01:18:23,954
Something seemed wrong about dreaming my life away.

838
01:18:24,023 --> 01:18:27,017
I learned what I could from the black hole

839
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,488
but I couldn't send anything to your father.

840
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:34,370
We've been receiving but nothing gets out.
-Is he alive?

841
01:18:34,453 --> 01:18:37,416
Oh, yeah.
-Yeah? -Yeah.

842
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:44,342
We've got years of messages stored.
-Cooper.

843
01:18:44,451 --> 01:18:47,804
Messages span 23 years.

844
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:51,359
Play from the beginning.

845
01:18:54,732 --> 01:18:59,551
Hey Dad,
Just checkin' in, sayin' hi.

846
01:19:00,856 --> 01:19:04,198
Umm, finished 2nd in school,

847
01:19:04,308 --> 01:19:07,906
Miss Carlin's still giving me Cs though,

848
01:19:08,055 --> 01:19:11,213
pulled me down,
but second's not bad.

849
01:19:12,364 --> 01:19:14,631
Grandpa attended the ceremony.

850
01:19:16,227 --> 01:19:20,709
Umm, oh, I met another girl dad.

851
01:19:20,752 --> 01:19:25,769
I uh, I really think this is the one.

852
01:19:26,286 --> 01:19:28,901
Her name is Lois.
That's her right there.

853
01:19:32,575 --> 01:19:34,195
Murphy stole grandpa's car,

854
01:19:34,303 --> 01:19:37,971
She crashed it, she's okay though.

855
01:19:38,042 --> 01:19:42,838
Hey Dad.
Look at this!

856
01:19:42,917 --> 01:19:47,272
You're a grandpa!
His name's Jesse.

857
01:19:47,377 --> 01:19:52,528
I wanted to go with Coop, but
Lois says maybe next time.

858
01:19:52,651 --> 01:19:55,103
And Donald says he's already got the 'great' part so,

859
01:19:55,176 --> 01:19:57,637
we're not to call him that.

860
01:19:57,752 --> 01:20:01,797


861
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:15,755
Say goodbye to Grandpa.

862
01:20:04,861 --> 01:20:07,815
Goodbye grandpa.

863
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:09,725
Sorry, it's been a while.

864
01:20:10,945 --> 01:20:17,016
It's..., what with Jesse and all...

865
01:20:21,466 --> 01:20:25,776
Uhh, grandpa died last week.

866
01:20:25,883 --> 01:20:28,548
We buried him out in the back 40 next to mom...

867
01:20:28,549 --> 01:20:31,110
...and Jesse.

868
01:20:32,490 --> 01:20:37,018
Which is where we would've buried you,
if you would've ever,... come back.

869
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:40,468
Murph was there at the funeral.

870
01:20:41,478 --> 01:20:44,130
We don't see her that much, but she came for that.

871
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:50,067
You're not listening to this, I know.

872
01:20:53,069 --> 01:20:58,606
All these messages are just, ... drifting...

873
01:20:58,713 --> 01:21:00,977
out there in the darkness.

874
01:21:01,085 --> 01:21:07,179
Lois says that, uh... I have to let you go.

875
01:21:08,369 --> 01:21:09,376
And uh...

876
01:21:10,688 --> 01:21:11,524
...so...

877
01:21:14,082 --> 01:21:18,026
I guess... I'll let you go.

878
01:21:19,076 --> 01:21:21,267
I don't know where you're dad.

879
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:24,941
But I hope that you're at peace. And...

880
01:21:25,052 --> 01:21:27,559
Goodbye.

881
01:21:39,993 --> 01:21:42,220
Hey Dad.

882
01:21:45,284 --> 01:21:48,202
Hey Murph.
-You son of a bitch!

883
01:21:51,599 --> 01:21:54,899
I never made one of these when you were still responding,

884
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:56,773
because I was so mad at you for leaving.

885
01:21:59,175 --> 01:22:02,013
And then when you went quiet,

886
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:07,945
it felt like I should've lived with that decision,
and I have,

887
01:22:11,913 --> 01:22:14,525
but today is my birthday,

888
01:22:17,818 --> 01:22:21,562
And it's a special one,
because you told me,

889
01:22:24,499 --> 01:22:27,842
you once told me that when you come back...

890
01:22:27,956 --> 01:22:29,869
...we might be the same age.

891
01:22:31,569 --> 01:22:34,753
And today I'm the age
you were when you left.

892
01:22:37,641 --> 01:22:41,019
So it would be a real good time for you to come back!

893
01:22:53,191 --> 01:22:55,660
I didn't mean to intrude,

894
01:22:56,596 --> 01:23:00,748
It's just that I've never seen you in here before.
-Because I've never been in here before.

895
01:23:03,124 --> 01:23:07,580
I talk to Amelia, all the time.
It helps.

896
01:23:07,731 --> 01:23:11,803
I'm glad you've started.
-I haven't.

897
01:23:11,915 --> 01:23:16,282
Just had something which needed to get out.
-I know they're still out there.

898
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:16,685
I know.

899
01:23:16,802 --> 01:23:21,646
There are so many reasons why our communications
might not be getting through.

900
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:22,944
I know Professor.

901
01:23:23,058 --> 01:23:27,092
I'm not sure, what I'm more afraid of.

902
01:23:27,205 --> 01:23:30,200
Them never coming back or...

903
01:23:30,270 --> 01:23:34,351
...coming back to find we've failed.

904
01:23:34,464 --> 01:23:37,861
Then let's succeed.
-So,

905
01:23:37,968 --> 01:23:42,867
back to the fourth iteration.
Let's run it through some new fields.

906
01:23:42,978 --> 01:23:46,558
With respect Professor, we've tried that
hundreds of times.

907
01:23:46,670 --> 01:23:50,189
-It only has to work once, Murph.

908
01:23:53,433 --> 01:23:56,844
Every rivet that they strike could've been a bullet.

909
01:23:56,921 --> 01:23:59,990
We've done well, in the world here,

910
01:24:00,098 --> 01:24:04,155
whether or not we crack the equation,
before I kick the bucket.

911
01:24:04,268 --> 01:24:07,939
Don't be morbid Professor.
-I'm not afraid of death.

912
01:24:08,047 --> 01:24:09,810
I am an old physicist.

913
01:24:11,444 --> 01:24:13,096
I'm afraid of time.

914
01:24:19,732 --> 01:24:21,434
Time.

915
01:24:23,616 --> 01:24:25,449
You're afraid of time.

916
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:30,460
For years we've been trying
to solve the equation without changing...

917
01:24:30,547 --> 01:24:33,139
...the underlying assumption about time.
-And?

918
01:24:33,293 --> 01:24:37,252
What it means, is each iteration
is an attempt to prove it's own proof,

919
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:41,200
it's recursive,...it's nonsensical.

920
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:45,047
Are you calling my life's work nonsense, Murph?

921
01:24:46,329 --> 01:24:49,374
No, I'm saying that you've been trying
to finish it with one arm...

922
01:24:49,375 --> 01:24:53,190
...no, with both arms tied behind your back.

923
01:24:54,623 --> 01:24:56,212
And I don't understand why.

924
01:24:57,325 --> 01:24:59,115
I am an old man Murph.

925
01:24:59,224 --> 01:25:02,751
Can we take this point up at another time?

926
01:25:02,862 --> 01:25:04,914
I want to talk to my daughter.

927
01:25:06,429 --> 01:25:09,810
Stepping out into the universe,

928
01:25:09,927 --> 01:25:14,050
we must confront the reality of interstellar travel.

929
01:25:14,162 --> 01:25:18,296
We must reach far beyond our own lifespans.

930
01:25:19,557 --> 01:25:22,304
We must think, not as individuals,

931
01:25:22,416 --> 01:25:24,614
but as a species.

932
01:25:25,946 --> 01:25:30,937
'Do not go gentle into that good night.'

933
01:25:31,486 --> 01:25:34,588
TARS kept the Endurance right where we needed her...

934
01:25:34,663 --> 01:25:37,398
...but the trip took years longer than what we anticipated.

935
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:40,334
We no longer have the fuel to visit both our prospects,

936
01:25:40,410 --> 01:25:42,993
so, we've got to choose.

937
01:25:44,648 --> 01:25:45,228
But how?

938
01:25:46,595 --> 01:25:48,076
They're both promising.

939
01:25:49,378 --> 01:25:51,769
And Edmunds data is better,

940
01:25:51,770 --> 01:25:54,553
but Dr. Mann is the one who's still transmitting. So...

941
01:25:54,663 --> 01:25:57,474
We've got no reason to suspect Edmunds data would've soured.

942
01:25:58,592 --> 01:26:02,804
His world has key elements to sustain human life.
-As does Dr. Mann's.

943
01:26:02,877 --> 01:26:04,245
Cooper, this is my field.

944
01:26:05,730 --> 01:26:10,245
And I really believe Edmund's is the better prospect.
-Why?

945
01:26:10,358 --> 01:26:15,350
Gargantua, that's why.
Look at Miller's planet.

946
01:26:15,461 --> 01:26:19,654
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes;
But no life. Sterile.

947
01:26:19,668 --> 01:26:24,511
We'll find the same thing on Mann's.
-Because of the black hole?

948
01:26:24,587 --> 01:26:28,087
-Murphy's Law.
Whatever can happen, will happen.

949
01:26:28,195 --> 01:26:30,865
Accidents are the first building block of evolution,

950
01:26:31,017 --> 01:26:34,398
but when you're orbiting a black hole,
not enough can happen,

951
01:26:34,513 --> 01:26:38,378
it sucks in asteroids, comets,
other events which would otherwise reach you.

952
01:26:38,487 --> 01:26:39,767
We need to go further afield.

953
01:26:40,516 --> 01:26:46,301
You once said that Dr. Mann, was the best of us.

954
01:26:46,411 --> 01:26:50,058
He is remarkable.
we're only here because of him.

955
01:26:50,165 --> 01:26:53,440
And, and yet here he is,
he is on the ground,

956
01:26:53,588 --> 01:26:58,209
and he's sending a very unambiguous message,
telling us to come to his planet.

957
01:26:59,194 --> 01:27:03,954
-Granted.
But Edmund's data is more promising.

958
01:27:04,027 --> 01:27:07,834
-We should vote.
-Well, if we're going to vote, there's something you should know,

959
01:27:07,944 --> 01:27:11,447
Brand, he has a right to know.

960
01:27:11,521 --> 01:27:14,953
That has nothing to do with it.
-What does?

961
01:27:15,066 --> 01:27:18,210
She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.
-Is that true?

962
01:27:18,323 --> 01:27:19,545
Yes.

963
01:27:22,293 --> 01:27:25,460
And that makes me want to follow my heart.

964
01:27:28,633 --> 01:27:32,678
Maybe we've spent too long trying
to figure all this out with theory,

965
01:27:32,756 --> 01:27:35,881
-You're a scientist Brand.
-So listen to me,

966
01:27:35,996 --> 01:27:40,640
When I say that love isn't
something we invented, it's...

967
01:27:40,752 --> 01:27:44,314
...observable, powerful.

968
01:27:46,227 --> 01:27:50,933
It has to mean something.
-Love has meaning, yes, social utility...

969
01:27:50,934 --> 01:27:54,521
...social bonding, child rearing,
-We love people who have died,

970
01:27:54,628 --> 01:27:58,565
where's the social utility in that?
-None.

971
01:27:58,676 --> 01:28:01,473
-Maybe it means something more,
something we can't...

972
01:28:01,546 --> 01:28:04,566
...yet understand.

973
01:28:04,633 --> 01:28:07,977
Maybe it's, some evidence, some...

974
01:28:08,855 --> 01:28:13,626
...artifact of a higher dimension...
that we can't consciously perceive,

975
01:28:13,749 --> 01:28:16,651
I'm drawn across the universe to someone...

976
01:28:16,724 --> 01:28:21,351
...I haven't seen in a decade.
Who, I know, is probably dead.

977
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:24,485
Love is the one thing we're capable...

978
01:28:24,555 --> 01:28:27,778
...of perceiving that transcends
dimensions of time and space.

979
01:28:29,041 --> 01:28:32,107
Maybe we should trust that,

980
01:28:32,178 --> 01:28:35,110
even if we can't understand it yet.

981
01:28:38,591 --> 01:28:40,821
Alright Cooper,

982
01:28:43,238 --> 01:28:44,176
Yes!

983
01:28:45,687 --> 01:28:48,895
The tiniest possibility of
seeing Wolf again excites me.

984
01:28:49,116 --> 01:28:53,843
But that doesn't mean I'm wrong.
-Honestly Amelia,

985
01:28:55,757 --> 01:28:57,122
it might.

986
01:29:02,842 --> 01:29:06,615
TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.

987
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:31,891
We'll lose about a third again. Next year.
Next year, I'm gonna work Nelson's farm and I'm gonna make it up.

988
01:29:32,004 --> 01:29:33,910
What happened to Nelson?

989
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:44,608
Murph, can I get you anything?
Would you like some more Soufflé?
-No, I'm full. Thanks.

990
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:45,583
It was delicious.

991
01:29:46,987 --> 01:29:48,426
Hand me that donut please.

992
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:54,993
Will you spend the night?
Your room is exactly as you left it. It's...

993
01:29:55,028 --> 01:29:58,379
-I need to get back.
-My sewing machine is in there, but there's plenty...

994
01:29:58,449 --> 01:30:01,454
-I need to...

995
01:30:02,892 --> 01:30:07,037
...too many memories.
-Well, we have something for that.

996
01:30:07,153 --> 01:30:08,405


997
01:29:26,812 --> 01:29:27,915
Dust.

998
01:30:18,535 --> 01:30:21,811
Lois, I have a friend who could...

999
01:30:21,891 --> 01:30:24,080
...look at his lungs.

1000
01:30:42,236 --> 01:30:45,263
Amelia, I'm sorry.
-You're just being objective.

1001
01:30:45,335 --> 01:30:48,530
Unless you're punishing me,
for screwing up on Miller's planet,

1002
01:30:48,733 --> 01:30:50,737
-No, this wasn't a personal decision.

1003
01:30:50,813 --> 01:30:55,272
Well, if you're wrong, you have
a very personal decision to make.

1004
01:30:55,383 --> 01:30:59,415
Your fuel calculations
are based on a return journey.

1005
01:30:59,524 --> 01:31:02,464
Strike out on Mann's planet and you'll
have to decide whether...

1006
01:31:02,539 --> 01:31:06,026
...to return home, or push onto Edmunds with plan B.

1007
01:31:06,190 --> 01:31:09,999
Starting a colony could save us from extinction.

1008
01:31:10,113 --> 01:31:12,853
You might have to decide between
seeing your children again...

1009
01:31:12,964 --> 01:31:14,901
...or the future of the human race.

1010
01:31:16,052 --> 01:31:17,973
I trust you'll be as objective then.

1011
01:31:24,122 --> 01:31:27,397
He has been asking for you since he came to.

1012
01:31:27,472 --> 01:31:28,770
We were trying to reach you.

1013
01:31:34,461 --> 01:31:38,155
Murph?
-Hey.
I'm here Professor.

1014
01:31:38,264 --> 01:31:41,644
I think I let all down.

1015
01:31:41,758 --> 01:31:44,820
No, you got us this far.
We're close.

1016
01:31:46,161 --> 01:31:48,399
I will finish what you started.

1017
01:31:48,513 --> 01:31:51,630
Good, good Murph.

1018
01:31:51,744 --> 01:31:55,938
You had faith.

1019
01:31:56,011 --> 01:32:01,484
All those, all those years,

1020
01:32:02,356 --> 01:32:06,483
I asked you to have faith,

1021
01:32:07,609 --> 01:32:18,635
I wanted you to believe, that your father,... would come back.

1022
01:32:19,032 --> 01:32:20,903
I do Professor.

1023
01:32:22,637 --> 01:32:26,559
Forgive me Murph.
-There's nothing to forgive.

1024
01:32:28,467 --> 01:32:33,286
I lied Murph,

1025
01:32:34,405 --> 01:32:36,716
I lied to you.

1026
01:32:42,441 --> 01:32:49,399
There was no need for him, to come back.

1027
01:32:50,570 --> 01:32:55,786
There's no way to help us.

1028
01:32:55,859 --> 01:32:59,193
But the Plan A? All this?

1029
01:33:00,029 --> 01:33:04,570
All these people.
And the equation?

1030
01:33:07,546 --> 01:33:09,881
Did my father know?

1031
01:33:12,761 --> 01:33:15,383
Did he leave me?

1032
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:28,204
'Do....not....go....gentle....'

1033
01:33:28,396 --> 01:33:34,176
No. NO!

1034
01:33:34,294 --> 01:33:38,595
You can't leave.
NO!!

1035
01:33:38,705 --> 01:33:42,801
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

1036
01:33:42,908 --> 01:33:46,007
He didn't feel any pain. He was at peace.

1037
01:33:46,087 --> 01:33:48,854
I'm very sorry for your loss.

1038
01:34:01,439 --> 01:34:03,637
Brand did you know?

1039
01:34:05,154 --> 01:34:07,431
He told you right?

1040
01:34:09,032 --> 01:34:11,692
You knew?

1041
01:34:12,743 --> 01:34:15,191
This was all a sham.

1042
01:34:19,826 --> 01:34:21,444
You left us here.

1043
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:25,263
To suffocate.

1044
01:34:26,522 --> 01:34:28,354
To starve.

1045
01:34:55,363 --> 01:34:57,534
Frozen cloud.

1046
01:37:21,492 --> 01:37:24,756
It's okay.

1047
01:37:30,013 --> 01:37:33,026
It's okay.

1048
01:37:33,144 --> 01:37:35,086
It's okay.

1049
01:37:37,882 --> 01:37:40,167
Pray you never learn,

1050
01:37:41,542 --> 01:37:44,522
just how good it can be to see another face.

1051
01:37:52,707 --> 01:37:57,997
I hadn't had a lot of hope to begin with.
After so long I had none.

1052
01:37:59,727 --> 01:38:02,460
My supplies were completely exhausted.

1053
01:38:04,338 --> 01:38:08,535
The last time I went to sleep,
I didn't even set up a waking date.

1054
01:38:12,291 --> 01:38:14,993
You've literally raised me from the dead.

1055
01:38:16,008 --> 01:38:17,228
Lazarus.

1056
01:38:18,384 --> 01:38:22,372
What about the others?
-I'm afraid you're it sir.

1057
01:38:23,385 --> 01:38:25,302
So far, surely.

1058
01:38:25,878 --> 01:38:28,556
No. In our present situation...

1059
01:38:28,669 --> 01:38:31,363
...there's very little chance of rescuing any others.

1060
01:38:34,452 --> 01:38:35,873
Dr. Mann.

1061
01:38:36,243 --> 01:38:39,508
Dr. Mann, tell us about your world.

1062
01:38:42,702 --> 01:38:44,757
Our world, we hope...

1063
01:38:47,146 --> 01:38:56,239
Our world is cold, stark,
but undeniably beautiful.

1064
01:38:58,158 --> 01:39:01,488
The days are 67 hours long, cold.

1065
01:39:05,378 --> 01:39:09,297
The nights are 67 far colder hours.

1066
01:39:14,302 --> 01:39:20,217
The gravity is a very, very pleasant
80% of the Earth's.

1067
01:39:20,331 --> 01:39:23,502
Now here, where I landed,
the water is alkali.

1068
01:39:23,619 --> 01:39:27,316
And the air has too much ammonia in it
to breathe for more than just a few minutes.

1069
01:39:27,317 --> 01:39:31,996
But, down at the surface, and there is, a surface,

1070
01:39:32,066 --> 01:39:36,643
the chlorine dissipates,
the ammonia gives way to crystalline hydrocarbons.

1071
01:39:36,751 --> 01:39:39,486
Breathable air, to organics.

1072
01:39:39,596 --> 01:39:42,333
Possibly even, to life.

1073
01:39:42,414 --> 01:39:45,258
We might be sharing this world.

1074
01:39:45,370 --> 01:39:47,654
These readings are from the surface?

1075
01:39:47,770 --> 01:39:52,487
Over the years, I've dropped various probes.
-How far have you explored?

1076
01:39:52,596 --> 01:39:55,547
I have managed several major expeditions,
but with oxygen in...

1077
01:39:55,621 --> 01:40:00,567
...limited supply, KIPP there,
really did most of the legwork.
-What went wrong with him sir?

1078
01:40:00,646 --> 01:40:03,471
Degeneration. He misidentified the first organics...

1079
01:40:03,472 --> 01:40:08,436
...we found as ammonia crystals.
We struggled on for a time, but...

1080
01:40:08,510 --> 01:40:12,405
...ultimately I decommissioned him,
used his power source to keep the mission going.

1081
01:40:12,594 --> 01:40:16,770
I thought I was alone before I even shut him down.
-Would you like me to take a look at him?

1082
01:40:16,842 --> 01:40:20,190
No, no, needs a human touch.

1083
01:40:20,262 --> 01:40:22,511
Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message...

1084
01:40:22,512 --> 01:40:26,800
...for you, from the spaceship.
-Okay, be right there. Excuse me.

1085
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:42,392
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

1086
01:40:42,505 --> 01:40:48,199
He had no pain. He was at peace.

1087
01:40:50,516 --> 01:40:52,501
I'm sorry for your loss.

1088
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:59,714
Is that Murph?
-She's,...she's grown!

1089
01:40:59,787 --> 01:41:00,798
Brand did you know?

1090
01:41:02,206 --> 01:41:03,721
He told you right?

1091
01:41:06,063 --> 01:41:08,073
You knew?

1092
01:41:09,597 --> 01:41:13,851
This was all a sham.
You left us here.

1093
01:41:15,006 --> 01:41:17,669
To suffocate.

1094
01:41:19,370 --> 01:41:21,070
To starve.

1095
01:41:24,777 --> 01:41:26,330
Did my father know too?

1096
01:41:28,601 --> 01:41:29,789
Dad!

1097
01:41:32,026 --> 01:41:37,997
I just want to know, if you left me here to die?

1098
01:41:39,157 --> 01:41:42,080
I just have to know!

1099
01:41:47,197 --> 01:41:55,934
Cooper, my father dedicated
his whole life to plan A, I have...

1100
01:41:56,009 --> 01:41:58,131
...no idea what she's talking about.

1101
01:41:59,217 --> 01:42:00,702
I do.

1102
01:42:05,133 --> 01:42:09,017
He, he never even hoped to get the
people off the Earth?

1103
01:42:09,090 --> 01:42:10,708
No.

1104
01:42:15,180 --> 01:42:18,991
But he has been trying to solve
the gravity equation for 40 years.

1105
01:42:19,100 --> 01:42:23,312
Amelia, your father solved his
equation before I even left.

1106
01:42:23,386 --> 01:42:25,302
Then why wouldn't he use it?

1107
01:42:25,411 --> 01:42:29,878
The equation couldn't reconcile
relativity with quantum mechanics
You need more.

1108
01:42:29,951 --> 01:42:34,574
More? More what?
-More data. You need to see into a black hole.

1109
01:42:34,575 --> 01:42:38,715
The laws of nature prohibit a naked singularity.
-Romilly, is that true?

1110
01:42:39,553 --> 01:42:43,793
If the black hole is an oyster, then
the singularity is the pearl inside.

1111
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:46,213
The gravity is so strong that it is always hidden...

1112
01:42:46,286 --> 01:42:48,045
...in darkness, beyond the horizon.

1113
01:42:49,136 --> 01:42:51,366
That's why we call it a 'black' hole.

1114
01:42:51,475 --> 01:42:55,700
Okay,...what if we see beyond the horizon?

1115
01:42:55,775 --> 01:42:59,862
We can't Cooper.
-There are some things that aren't meant to be known.

1116
01:42:59,970 --> 01:43:04,397
Your father had to find another way to save
the human race from extinction.

1117
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:07,964
Plan B, a colony.
-But why not tell people?

1118
01:43:09,413 --> 01:43:10,793
Why keep it from us?

1119
01:43:10,907 --> 01:43:13,283
Because he knew how hard it would be
to get people...

1120
01:43:13,284 --> 01:43:18,282
...to work together to save the species
instead of themselves. Or their children.

1121
01:43:18,387 --> 01:43:19,471
Bullshit!

1122
01:43:19,579 --> 01:43:22,324
You never would have come here unless
you believed you were gonna save them.

1123
01:43:22,438 --> 01:43:25,198
Evolution has yet to
transcend that simple barrier.

1124
01:43:25,272 --> 01:43:29,482
We can care deeply, selflessly
about those we know.

1125
01:43:29,553 --> 01:43:33,911
But that empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight.
-But the lie?

1126
01:43:37,263 --> 01:43:41,839
That monstrous lie?
-Unforgivable.

1127
01:43:41,951 --> 01:43:46,738
And he knew that.
He was prepared to destroy his own humanity,

1128
01:43:46,850 --> 01:43:50,342
in order to save the species,
he made an incredible sacrifice.

1129
01:43:50,456 --> 01:43:54,950
NO! No, an incredible sacrifice is being made,

1130
01:43:55,025 --> 01:43:57,929
by the people on Earth who're gonna die!

1131
01:43:57,936 --> 01:44:02,581
Because in his fucking arrogance,
he declared their case hopeless.

1132
01:44:02,688 --> 01:44:07,145
I'm sorry Cooper,
their case is hopeless.

1133
01:44:07,187 --> 01:44:11,413
No. No.
-We are the future.

1134
01:44:12,852 --> 01:44:14,073
Cooper.

1135
01:44:15,201 --> 01:44:16,752
Cooper, what I can do?

1136
01:44:19,635 --> 01:44:21,509
Let me go home.

1137
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:24,679
You're absolutely positive?

1138
01:44:24,792 --> 01:44:29,297
His solution was correct. He's had it for years.
-It's worthless?

1139
01:44:29,368 --> 01:44:30,999
It's half the answer.

1140
01:44:31,585 --> 01:44:35,132
Okay, how do you find the other half?

1141
01:44:35,245 --> 01:44:38,384
Out there, in a black hole.
But stuck down on Earth?

1142
01:44:38,493 --> 01:44:40,007
Yeah?

1143
01:44:41,235 --> 01:44:42,744
I'm not sure you can.

1144
01:44:43,689 --> 01:44:47,589
God, they just pack up and leave.

1145
01:44:49,208 --> 01:44:52,976
What're they hoping to find?
-Survival.

1146
01:45:00,224 --> 01:45:01,555
Damn it!

1147
01:45:04,623 --> 01:45:08,469
Murph, don't, don't people have the right to know?

1148
01:45:08,587 --> 01:45:13,010
Panic won't help.
We just have to keep working, same as ever.

1149
01:45:13,081 --> 01:45:16,300
Yes, but isn't that exactly what
Professor Brand was manipulating...

1150
01:45:16,408 --> 01:45:19,723
-Brand gave up on us.
I'm still trying to solve this.

1151
01:45:20,381 --> 01:45:24,245
So, do you have an idea?

1152
01:45:25,431 --> 01:45:26,906
A feeling.

1153
01:45:29,427 --> 01:45:31,849
I told you about my ghost.

1154
01:45:33,404 --> 01:45:37,952
My dad thought I called it a ghost
because I was scared of it.

1155
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:43,491
But I was never scared of it.

1156
01:45:44,467 --> 01:45:52,205
I called it a ghost because
it felt....like a person,

1157
01:45:53,969 --> 01:45:56,814
that was trying to tell me something.

1158
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:02,184
If there is an answer
here on Earth, it's back there,

1159
01:46:02,256 --> 01:46:06,502
somehow in that room.
So I have to find it.

1160
01:46:09,890 --> 01:46:11,978
We're running out of time.

1161
01:46:13,024 --> 01:46:16,154
What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?

1162
01:46:16,261 --> 01:46:19,922
They can stay CASE.
I'll be sleeping most of the way anyway.
-Hey Coop. -Yeah?

1163
01:46:20,030 --> 01:46:23,474
I had a suggestion for your return journey.
-What is that?

1164
01:46:23,583 --> 01:46:25,459
Have one last crack at the black hole.

1165
01:46:26,767 --> 01:46:30,269
I'm going home Rom.
-Yeah I know.

1166
01:46:30,376 --> 01:46:35,033
This isn't gonna cost you any time.
It's a chance for the people on Earth.

1167
01:46:35,111 --> 01:46:38,877
Talk to me.
-Gargantua is an older spinning black hole.

1168
01:46:38,985 --> 01:46:42,200
It is what we call a 'gentle' singularity.
-Gentle?

1169
01:46:42,322 --> 01:46:46,718
They're hardly gentle.
But the tidal gravity is so quick that something...

1170
01:46:46,825 --> 01:46:51,105
...crossing the horizon fast, might survive.
A probe say.

1171
01:46:51,177 --> 01:46:52,657
What happens after it crosses?

1172
01:46:52,736 --> 01:46:55,618
After, the horizon,
is a complete mystery.

1173
01:46:55,691 --> 01:46:58,487
So, what's to say that there isn't some
way that the probe can...

1174
01:46:58,488 --> 01:47:01,412
...glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

1175
01:47:01,542 --> 01:47:05,564
If he's equipped to transmit every form of energy that can pulse...

1176
01:47:05,653 --> 01:47:10,508
Just when did this probe become a 'he' professor?
-TARS is the obvious candidate.

1177
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:13,225
I've already told him what to look for.

1178
01:47:13,341 --> 01:47:17,555
I'll need the old optical transmitter on KIPP, Cooper.
-You would do this for us?

1179
01:47:17,663 --> 01:47:20,504
Before you get all teary,
try to remember that as a robot...

1180
01:47:20,578 --> 01:47:24,190
...I have to do anything you say.
-Your cue light's blinking.

1181
01:47:24,264 --> 01:47:25,680
I'm not joking!

1182
01:47:27,304 --> 01:47:32,029
I'm gonna need TARS to remove and adapt
some components from KIPP.

1183
01:47:32,099 --> 01:47:35,682
Well, I don't wanna disturb his archival functions.
-I'll supervise.

1184
01:47:35,792 --> 01:47:39,971
Alright.
-Dr. Mann, we need to find 3 secure sites.

1185
01:47:40,051 --> 01:47:42,314
One for Brand's lab and 2 for habitat.

1186
01:47:42,428 --> 01:47:44,977
Once those modules have landed,
you don't wanna move.

1187
01:47:45,077 --> 01:47:47,234
Well I can take you to the probes sites,
but I don't think this...

1188
01:47:47,349 --> 01:47:50,263
...these conditions are gonna hold.
I think we should wait.

1189
01:47:50,374 --> 01:47:53,256
CASE is headed back down with the
rest of the distillery equipment.

1190
01:47:53,339 --> 01:47:55,927
I would really like to secure those sites by nightfall.

1191
01:47:57,480 --> 01:48:01,437
Well, these squalls do usually blow over.

1192
01:48:01,515 --> 01:48:04,609
Okay then.
-You're gonna have to take a long-range transmitter.

1193
01:48:04,723 --> 01:48:06,499
Right.
-Are you charged? -Yeah.

1194
01:48:06,581 --> 01:48:07,995
Follow me.

1195
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:12,804
TARS, 72 hours yeah? -Roger that Cooper.

1196
01:48:18,979 --> 01:48:22,033
Brand told me why you feel you've got to go back.

1197
01:48:22,847 --> 01:48:27,625
But I'd be remiss
if didn't at least mention that a mission...

1198
01:48:27,697 --> 01:48:30,862
...such as ours could certainly do
with an extra engineer.

1199
01:48:32,322 --> 01:48:34,666
Oh you better slow down turbo.

1200
01:48:34,778 --> 01:48:39,717
Safety first CASE, do not forget.
-Safety first Cooper.

1201
01:48:39,795 --> 01:48:44,256
I have to tell you Dr. Mann
I'm honored to be a part of this.

1202
01:48:44,369 --> 01:48:46,527
But once we set up
base camp and...

1203
01:48:46,641 --> 01:48:50,992
...secure those modules, my work is done here.
I'm going home.

1204
01:48:53,290 --> 01:48:55,955


1205
01:48:09,829 --> 01:48:11,556
We have attachments.

1206
01:49:00,632 --> 01:49:04,918
But even without a family,
I can, promise you that, that yearning...

1207
01:49:05,024 --> 01:49:07,505
...to be with other people is remarkable.

1208
01:49:07,538 --> 01:49:13,581
That emotion is, at the foundation, of what makes us human.

1209
01:49:13,710 --> 01:49:14,781


1210
01:48:33,266 --> 01:48:36,925
How long have you had that cough?
-For a while.

1211
01:49:35,857 --> 01:49:38,156
Mom let's me play in here.

1212
01:49:38,698 --> 01:49:41,034
I don't touch your stuff.

1213
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:13,733
Just take this gently.

1214
01:50:19,161 --> 01:50:22,619
You know why we couldn't just send
machines on these missions, don't you Cooper?

1215
01:50:22,733 --> 01:50:27,709
A machine doesn't improvise well,
because you can't programme the fear of death.

1216
01:50:27,781 --> 01:50:32,345
Our survival instinct is
our single greatest source of inspiration.

1217
01:50:32,455 --> 01:50:34,447
Take you for example,

1218
01:50:35,341 --> 01:50:40,499
A father, with a survival instinct
that extends to your kids.

1219
01:50:40,622 --> 01:50:45,965
What does research tell us, is the
last thing you're gonna see, before you die?

1220
01:50:47,408 --> 01:50:50,798
Your children.
Their faces.

1221
01:50:50,875 --> 01:50:54,976
At the moment of death, your mind
is going to push you a little bit harder, to survive.

1222
01:50:55,057 --> 01:50:58,642
For them.

1223
01:51:00,737 --> 01:51:04,759
Hey, I bet you're Coop.
Why don't you have a seat here for me.

1224
01:51:04,886 --> 01:51:07,328
It's bad.
They cannot stay here.

1225
01:51:07,687 --> 01:51:09,462
OK? -Yes.

1226
01:51:17,230 --> 01:51:21,881
TARS, what's taking so long?
-Professor, I'm having trouble completing the boot-up.

1227
01:51:21,992 --> 01:51:23,782
I don't understand?

1228
01:51:30,562 --> 01:51:31,755
It's funny.

1229
01:51:33,727 --> 01:51:38,790
When I left Earth,
I thought I was prepared to die.

1230
01:51:39,764 --> 01:51:47,044
The truth is, I never really, considered...

1231
01:51:47,158 --> 01:51:49,455
...the possibility that my planet wasn't the one.

1232
01:51:51,567 --> 01:51:55,659
Nothing turns out the way it's supposed to be.
-Let's go.

1233
01:52:01,313 --> 01:52:03,891
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!!

1234
01:52:12,002 --> 01:52:14,218
What is this?
-What are you doing??

1235
01:52:14,330 --> 01:52:17,683
I'm sorry, I can't let you leave
with that ship.

1236
01:52:17,765 --> 01:52:20,420
We're going to need it
to complete the mission.

1237
01:52:20,530 --> 01:52:25,527
Once the others, realize what this place isn't.
We cannot survive here.

1238
01:52:25,604 --> 01:52:27,993
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1239
01:52:37,981 --> 01:52:39,299
They can't stay here anymore.

1240
01:52:39,373 --> 01:52:42,995
You have to leave, right now.
Hey buddy, let me make something abundantly clear...

1241
01:52:43,071 --> 01:52:45,837
You have a responsibility.
-Shit.

1242
01:52:45,949 --> 01:52:48,543
Coop, get her stuff, she's goin' home.

1243
01:52:48,653 --> 01:52:50,723
-Dad didn't raise you to be this dumb Tom!

1244
01:52:50,802 --> 01:52:53,099
Dad didn't raise me, grandpa did,
and he's buried...

1245
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:54,614
...out back with mom and Jesse.

1246
01:52:54,649 --> 01:53:04,103
All the data?

1247
01:53:06,177 --> 01:53:11,009
No. I tried to do my duty Cooper.

1248
01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:15,932
But I knew, the day that I arrived here,
this place had nothing...

1249
01:53:16,008 --> 01:53:20,289
...and I resisted the temptation, for years

1250
01:53:20,364 --> 01:53:28,320
But, I knew that, if I just pressed
that button, then, somebody would come and save me.

1251
01:53:29,446 --> 01:53:32,825
You fucking coward!
-Yes.

1252
01:53:37,806 --> 01:53:39,208
Yes.

1253
01:53:40,582 --> 01:53:42,129
Yes.

1254
01:53:43,135 --> 01:53:44,069
Yes.

1255
01:53:55,932 --> 01:54:00,685
Listen, if you're not gonna go, let your family go.
Just let,...save your family.

1256
01:54:00,717 --> 01:54:05,574
And go to live underground? With you?
Pray that daddy comes to save us?

1257
01:54:05,644 --> 01:54:09,569
Dad's not coming back. He never was coming back.
It's upto me!

1258
01:54:09,613 --> 01:54:14,477
Are you going to save everybody?
Because dad couldn't do it?. -DAD DIDN'T EVEN TRY!!

1259
01:54:14,597 --> 01:54:16,293
Dad just abandoned us!!

1260
01:54:17,483 --> 01:54:21,733
He left us here to die.
-Nobody is going with you.

1261
01:54:25,618 --> 01:54:27,822
You're gonna wait for your next kid to die?

1262
01:54:30,851 --> 01:54:34,745
Get out, and don't come back!

1263
01:54:39,510 --> 01:54:41,352
Do what you want with those things.

1264
01:54:52,037 --> 01:54:53,740
Stop it!

1265
01:54:55,510 --> 01:54:58,061
No. NO!

1266
01:54:58,998 --> 01:55:02,347
Dr. Mann there's a 50-50 chance that you're gonna kill yourselves.

1267
01:55:02,420 --> 01:55:05,156
Those are the best odds I've had in years!

1268
01:55:25,209 --> 01:55:30,041
Don't judge me Cooper.
You were never tested like I was.

1269
01:55:30,486 --> 01:55:32,414
Few men have been.

1270
01:55:40,704 --> 01:55:42,400
You tried your best Murph.

1271
01:55:51,209 --> 01:55:53,123
Do you feel it?

1272
01:55:54,133 --> 01:55:56,431
The survival instinct.

1273
01:55:57,336 --> 01:56:02,011
That's what drove me.
It's what drives all of us, and it's what's gonna save us.

1274
01:56:02,087 --> 01:56:05,843
Because I want to save all of us.
For you Cooper.

1275
01:56:10,963 --> 01:56:14,979
I'm sorry, I can't,
I can't watch you go through this. I'm sorry.

1276
01:56:15,055 --> 01:56:17,324
I thought I could, but I can't.

1277
01:56:18,589 --> 01:56:21,054
I'm here, I'm here for you.

1278
01:56:21,161 --> 01:56:24,953
Just listen to my voice Cooper, I'm right here.

1279
01:56:26,078 --> 01:56:28,709
You're not alone.

1280
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:40,049
Do you see your children?

1281
01:56:42,537 --> 01:56:46,661
It's okay.
They are right there with you.

1282
01:56:50,522 --> 01:56:53,802
Did Professor Brand tell you that poem
before you left?

1283
01:56:53,912 --> 01:56:55,606
Do you remember?

1284
01:56:56,833 --> 01:57:01,300
'Do not go gentle,
into that good night'

1285
01:57:01,413 --> 01:57:07,129
'Old age should burn, and rave
at close of day.'

1286
01:57:08,470 --> 01:57:11,821
'Rage, rage against the
dying of the light.'

1287
01:57:36,233 --> 01:57:39,127
Help! Help!
-Cooper?

1288
01:57:46,045 --> 01:57:48,864
CASE!
-Brand.

1289
01:57:49,818 --> 01:57:50,694
No air!

1290
01:57:52,726 --> 01:57:56,174
Cooper. Cooper I'm coming.
CASE! -I have a fix.

1291
01:57:56,256 --> 01:57:58,590
Go, go, go!!

1292
01:58:10,341 --> 01:58:13,178
Cooper we're coming, hang in there, don't talk!

1293
01:58:13,251 --> 01:58:15,762
Breathe as little as possible. We're almost there!

1294
01:58:18,774 --> 01:58:21,244
There is a security lockout sir, it requires...

1295
01:58:21,326 --> 01:58:24,017
...a person to access the functions.

1296
01:58:28,530 --> 01:58:31,784
It's all yours sir.

1297
01:58:38,523 --> 01:58:43,049


1298
01:58:43,161 --> 01:58:48,056


1299
01:57:59,163 --> 01:58:00,082
Cooper!!

1300
01:58:52,788 --> 01:58:55,163
Come on!

1301
01:59:01,387 --> 01:59:05,816
I see him! I see him!
To the right. Bank right!

1302
01:59:23,848 --> 01:59:27,107
Cooper!
Cooper, I'm here.

1303
01:59:32,653 --> 01:59:33,672
Take this!

1304
01:59:41,514 --> 01:59:43,203
Joey bring the tankers!

1305
01:59:49,785 --> 01:59:52,122
This data makes no sense.

1306
01:59:59,742 --> 02:00:03,275
I'm sorry.
-What?

1307
02:00:03,390 --> 02:00:05,233
Mann, was lying!

1308
02:00:11,822 --> 02:00:14,890


1309
01:59:26,014 --> 01:59:28,927
Romilly!

1310
02:00:18,036 --> 02:00:21,324
Romilly, do you read me?
Romilly!!

1311
02:00:21,433 --> 02:00:23,207
STEP BACK PROFESSOR!! STEP BACK!!

1312
02:00:30,572 --> 02:00:33,849
Romilly. -Romilly! Do you read me?!!

1313
02:00:36,203 --> 02:00:37,821
Keep watch!

1314
02:00:38,973 --> 02:00:42,598
Lois!
-What happened to caution CASE?

1315
02:00:42,676 --> 02:00:44,041
Safety first Cooper.

1316
02:00:44,119 --> 02:00:47,860
Romilly, Romilly do you read me? This is Brand.

1317
02:00:50,627 --> 02:00:54,680
Romilly!
-Dr. Brand, Cooper, there's been an explosion.

1318
02:00:54,794 --> 02:00:56,728
Dr. Mann's compound.

1319
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:26,562
TARS, TARS! 10 o'clock.

1320
02:01:33,045 --> 02:01:35,006
Tell me when TARS is aboard.

1321
02:01:38,571 --> 02:01:40,336
Romilly did not survive.

1322
02:01:41,563 --> 02:01:45,448
I could not save him.
-TARS is in. -I'll take it from here!

1323
02:01:45,559 --> 02:01:47,945
D'you have a fix on the Ranger?
-He is pushing into orbit.

1324
02:01:48,058 --> 02:01:51,272
Ah, if he takes control
of that ship we're dead.

1325
02:01:52,503 --> 02:01:55,751
He'd maroon us?
-He is marooning us!

1326
02:01:57,084 --> 02:02:00,677
Get downstairs. Go wait by the car.

1327
02:02:07,397 --> 02:02:11,277
Come on.
Get in the back!

1328
02:02:11,346 --> 02:02:12,358
Get in the back seat, now!!

1329
02:02:17,537 --> 02:02:22,222
Dr. Mann please respond!
Dr. Mann please respond!!

1330
02:02:22,336 --> 02:02:26,333
He doesn't know the Endurance's docking procedure.
-But the autopilot does.

1331
02:02:26,446 --> 02:02:30,220
Not since TARS disabled it!
-Nice!

1332
02:02:30,293 --> 02:02:33,104
What is your trust setting TARS?
-Lower than yours apparently!

1333
02:02:37,955 --> 02:02:41,024
Do not attempt docking, I repeat do not attempt docking.

1334
02:03:40,375 --> 02:03:43,111
Auto docking sequence withheld.

1335
02:03:43,148 --> 02:03:47,461
Override. -Unauthorized.
-Override!

1336
02:03:47,537 --> 02:03:49,665
Unauthorized.

1337
02:03:54,076 --> 02:03:58,717
Do not attempt docking, I repeat Do Not! attempt docking! Please resp...

1338
02:04:42,250 --> 02:04:44,163
Moving slowly towards the Endurance.

1339
02:05:08,451 --> 02:05:12,791
Imperfect contact.
-Override! -Hatch locked.

1340
02:05:20,230 --> 02:05:22,649
Has he locked on yet? -Imperfectly.

1341
02:05:24,683 --> 02:05:26,368
Dr. Mann...

1342
02:05:47,024 --> 02:05:49,978
Hatch lockout disengaged.

1343
02:05:58,899 --> 02:06:02,785
Dr. Mann, do not, I repeat, do not open the hatch.

1344
02:06:02,858 --> 02:06:07,628
I repeat, do not open the hatch.
If you open the hatch, the airlock will depressurize.

1345
02:06:33,072 --> 02:06:36,087
What happens if he blows the airlock?
-Nothing good.

1346
02:06:41,841 --> 02:06:46,128
Okay, pull back, pull back. Retro thrusters full
move back CASE! -Maximum. -Back!

1347
02:06:46,381 --> 02:06:49,151
CASE relay my message
to the onboard computer...

1348
02:06:49,265 --> 02:06:50,769
...and have it rebroadcast
as emergency PA.

1349
02:06:50,804 --> 02:06:56,687
Dr. Mann, do not open the air hatch.

1350
02:06:56,796 --> 02:06:59,098
I repeat, do not... -Brand?

1351
02:06:59,170 --> 02:07:04,141
I don't know what he said to you?
But I'm taking command of the Endurance.

1352
02:07:04,217 --> 02:07:06,993
And then we're gonna talk about completing the mission.

1353
02:07:09,512 --> 02:07:12,352
Dr. Mann, listen to me!

1354
02:07:12,430 --> 02:07:16,315
This is not about my life, or Cooper's life,

1355
02:07:16,422 --> 02:07:18,194
This is about all mankind.

1356
02:07:19,283 --> 02:07:20,313
There is a moment...

1357
02:07:27,081 --> 02:07:28,121
It is not...

1358
02:07:36,259 --> 02:07:37,945
Oh, my God.

1359
02:07:55,853 --> 02:08:01,597
Cooper there's no point in using your fuel...
-Analyze the Endurance's spin.

1360
02:08:05,674 --> 02:08:08,481
-Cooper, what are you doing?
-Docking.

1361
02:08:11,353 --> 02:08:14,530
Computer says rotation at 67, 68 rpm.

1362
02:08:14,603 --> 02:08:18,747
Get ready to match our spin with the retro thrusters.
-It's not possible.

1363
02:08:18,829 --> 02:08:20,875
-No, it's necessary.

1364
02:08:31,953 --> 02:08:34,651
The Endurance is entering the atmosphere.

1365
02:08:38,879 --> 02:08:40,503
It does not have a heat shield.

1366
02:08:42,953 --> 02:08:45,610
CASE, you ready?
-Ready.

1367
02:08:53,979 --> 02:08:56,798
Cooper, this is no time for caution.

1368
02:08:58,565 --> 02:09:00,581
CASE, if I pass out, you take the stick.

1369
02:09:00,693 --> 02:09:04,182
TARS, get ready to engage
the docking mechanism.

1370
02:09:10,571 --> 02:09:14,011
The Endurance is starting to heat.
-20 feet out.

1371
02:09:14,093 --> 02:09:17,940
I need three degrees starboard Cooper.
-10 feet out.

1372
02:09:18,049 --> 02:09:21,581
Cooper, we are, lined up!

1373
02:09:21,697 --> 02:09:23,093
Initiate spin!

1374
02:10:04,997 --> 02:10:06,286
Hold on TARS!

1375
02:10:14,099 --> 02:10:15,390
HOLD ON!

1376
02:10:25,858 --> 02:10:29,323
We're locked Cooper. -EASING UP!

1377
02:10:36,567 --> 02:10:38,665
Slowly.

1378
02:10:39,692 --> 02:10:40,945
Slowly.

1379
02:10:46,219 --> 02:10:48,160
Retro thrusters!

1380
02:10:55,663 --> 02:10:57,948
Main engines on!

1381
02:11:03,061 --> 02:11:06,545
We're getting out of orbit. Come on baby!

1382
02:11:14,121 --> 02:11:15,747
Shutting engines.

1383
02:11:16,825 --> 02:11:18,813
Okay we're out of orbit!

1384
02:11:26,379 --> 02:11:29,616
Okay! And for our next trick!

1385
02:11:30,554 --> 02:11:34,703
It better be good.
We're headed into Gargantua's pull.

1386
02:11:35,670 --> 02:11:39,213
Shit. CASE take the stick.
-Roger that.

1387
02:12:28,345 --> 02:12:31,253
Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua.

1388
02:12:31,401 --> 02:12:33,924
Shall I use the engines?

1389
02:12:34,036 --> 02:12:38,348
No, we gotta let her slide as far as we can!

1390
02:12:47,609 --> 02:12:50,433
Give it to me.
-It's good news and bad news Cooper.

1391
02:12:50,543 --> 02:12:54,433
Yeah, to hell with it TARS!
Just give it to me straight.

1392
02:13:02,067 --> 02:13:06,104
The back-up generator kicked in,
so the system's stable. They're all good.

1393
02:13:07,274 --> 02:13:11,491
Good! Okay.
The navigational hub's been completely destroyed.

1394
02:13:11,599 --> 02:13:14,216
We don't have enough life support to make it back to Earth,

1395
02:13:14,291 --> 02:13:18,229
but I think we can scratch over to Edmund's planet.
-What about fuel?

1396
02:13:18,339 --> 02:13:21,042
It's not enough.
But I have a plan.

1397
02:13:21,081 --> 02:13:24,595
We let, Gargantua, pull us down close...

1398
02:13:24,598 --> 02:13:27,729
to the horizon, and a powered slingshot...

1399
02:13:27,848 --> 02:13:30,503
...around launching us towards Edmund's planet.
-Manually?

1400
02:13:30,615 --> 02:13:34,282
That's what I'm here for.
I'll take us just inside the critical orbit.

1401
02:13:34,357 --> 02:13:35,865
What about the time slippage?

1402
02:13:35,979 --> 02:13:39,472
Neither one of us have time
to worry about relativity right now Dr. Brand.

1403
02:13:44,075 --> 02:13:45,063
Sorry Cooper.

1404
02:13:47,300 --> 02:13:50,330
Once we have gathered enough speed...

1405
02:13:50,402 --> 02:13:53,454
...around Gargantua,
we use Lander 1,

1406
02:13:53,953 --> 02:13:56,590
and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters...

1407
02:13:56,847 --> 02:13:59,512
...to push us out of the black hole's gravity

1408
02:14:01,064 --> 02:14:03,904
The Lander's linkages have been destroyed,

1409
02:14:03,981 --> 02:14:06,970
so we're going to have
to control it manually.

1410
02:14:08,447 --> 02:14:11,725
Once Lander 1 is spent,
TARS will detach...

1411
02:14:11,834 --> 02:14:16,052
...and get sucked right into that black hole!
-Why does TARS have to detach?

1412
02:14:16,163 --> 02:14:20,651
We have to shed the weight, escape gravity.
-Newton's third law.

1413
02:14:20,727 --> 02:14:24,603
The only way humans have figured out of getting somewhere
is to leave something behind.

1414
02:14:24,759 --> 02:14:29,661
Cooper, you can't ask TARS to do this for us.
-He's a robot...

1415
02:14:29,776 --> 02:14:33,871
...so you don't have to ask him to do anything.
-Cooper, you asshole!

1416
02:14:33,943 --> 02:14:38,320
Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.
-It's what we intended Dr. Brand.

1417
02:14:38,337 --> 02:14:41,287
It's our only chance to save people on Earth,

1418
02:14:41,364 --> 02:14:46,126
if I can find a way to transmit the quantum data I'll find in there,
maybe they'll make it.

1419
02:14:47,714 --> 02:14:50,051
Let's just hope there is still someone there to save.

1420
02:15:18,609 --> 02:15:20,460
Maximum velocity achieved.

1421
02:15:20,536 --> 02:15:25,376
Prepare to fire speed thrusters.

1422
02:15:25,449 --> 02:15:27,985
Ready?
-Ready. -Ready.

1423
02:15:28,071 --> 02:15:34,286
Main engine ignition in 3, 2, 1...

1424
02:15:49,974 --> 02:15:52,072
Engines of Lander 1 on my command,

1425
02:15:52,983 --> 02:15:57,928
3, 2, 1...

1426
02:16:02,192 --> 02:16:05,321
Engines of Ranger 2 on my command,

1427
02:16:05,395 --> 02:16:09,956
3, 2, 1...

1428
02:16:19,179 --> 02:16:23,136
This little maneuver is gonna cost us 51 years!!

1429
02:16:23,214 --> 02:16:26,528
You're not too bad for someone pushing 120!

1430
02:16:41,641 --> 02:16:44,815
Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark,

1431
02:16:44,925 --> 02:16:50,748
3, 2, 1...

1432
02:16:50,820 --> 02:16:51,874
Detach!

1433
02:16:54,779 --> 02:16:59,347
Goodbye TARS!
-Goodbye Dr. Brand. See you on the other side Coop.

1434
02:16:59,424 --> 02:17:00,768
See you there slick!

1435
02:17:09,301 --> 02:17:12,754
Okay CASE. Nice reckless flying!

1436
02:17:12,869 --> 02:17:15,333
Learned from the master!

1437
02:17:15,414 --> 02:17:17,921
Ranger 2, prepare for detachment.

1438
02:17:18,004 --> 02:17:21,683
-What, no, no! Cooper, Cooper,
what are you doing??

1439
02:17:21,791 --> 02:17:25,060
Newton's third law.
You gotta leave something behind!

1440
02:17:25,429 --> 02:17:29,838
You said we had enough resources for both of us!
-We agreed Amelia,

1441
02:17:29,873 --> 02:17:32,405
90%

1442
02:17:32,518 --> 02:17:34,680
No!

1443
02:17:35,959 --> 02:17:38,130
Detach.

1444
02:17:51,513 --> 02:17:53,939
Okay, we're nosing down.

1445
02:17:57,419 --> 02:17:59,650
Approaching the event horizon.

1446
02:18:00,843 --> 02:18:12,948
Portside, dipping down beneath it..., to go through it.
Heading towards... blackness... <I have a visual of the event!>

1447
02:18:13,172 --> 02:18:15,044
It's all black!

1448
02:18:17,385 --> 02:18:21,463
TARS, do you read me? It's all black.

1449
02:18:22,261 --> 02:18:25,122
TARS, do you read me? Over.

1450
02:18:29,740 --> 02:18:36,070
We're...we're getting screens,
We're getting interference.

1451
02:18:37,914 --> 02:18:39,177
Losing control of the stick.

1452
02:18:39,281 --> 02:18:43,204
We've got flashes.
Flashes of lightness and blackness.

1453
02:18:43,279 --> 02:18:47,983
There's a turbulence in the gravity.

1454
02:18:52,666 --> 02:18:55,586
Computers going down.

1455
02:19:07,227 --> 02:19:10,459
The gravitational pull, we're losing control of the stick.

1456
02:19:43,465 --> 02:19:45,623
Murph! Murph, come on!

1457
02:21:52,486 --> 02:21:53,568
Murph!

1458
02:22:03,975 --> 02:22:06,101
Murph! Murph!! Murphhh!!

1459
02:22:14,673 --> 02:22:15,049
Murph!!

1460
02:22:22,464 --> 02:22:25,664
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Murphhhhhhhhh!!!!!

1461
02:22:25,740 --> 02:22:27,148
Murphhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!

1462
02:22:28,155 --> 02:22:29,273
No, no!!!!!!!

1463
02:23:28,479 --> 02:23:32,435
If you're leaving just go!
-No.

1464
02:23:33,408 --> 02:23:37,163
No, don't go. Don't go you idiot!
Don't go!!!

1465
02:23:39,543 --> 02:23:45,987
Morse, Morse, Morse.

1466
02:23:46,107 --> 02:23:46,843
'S'

1467
02:23:53,074 --> 02:23:53,827
'T'

1468
02:23:57,102 --> 02:23:59,562
'A'

1469
02:24:00,408 --> 02:24:01,580
'-'

1470
02:24:03,464 --> 02:24:05,758
'-'

1471
02:24:06,550 --> 02:24:10,403
Murph, we don't have time for this, come on!

1472
02:24:16,302 --> 02:24:17,400
STAY!!!

1473
02:24:27,677 --> 02:24:38,271
Come on, come on, Murph, Murph, come on!
What's it say? What's it say? What's it say?

1474
02:24:45,477 --> 02:24:46,449
It say's STAY!

1475
02:25:22,132 --> 02:25:24,883
Tell him Murph. Make him stay.

1476
02:25:27,264 --> 02:25:30,069
Make him, make him stay Murph.

1477
02:25:34,351 --> 02:25:35,897
STAY

1478
02:25:38,650 --> 02:25:40,595
Make him stay Murph!

1479
02:25:41,822 --> 02:25:44,409
Don't let me leave Murph!!!

1480
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:50,456
Don't, DON'T LET ME LEAVE MURPH!!!

1481
02:25:55,267 --> 02:25:57,720
NO, NO, NO, NOOO!!!.

1482
02:26:18,736 --> 02:26:20,427
It was you!!

1483
02:26:31,602 --> 02:26:34,087
You were my ghost!!

1484
02:26:45,697 --> 02:26:49,450
Cooper, Cooper come in.
-TARS??

1485
02:26:49,607 --> 02:26:51,041
Roger that.

1486
02:26:52,414 --> 02:26:55,608
You survived?
-Somewhere...

1487
02:26:55,725 --> 02:26:59,935
...in their fifth dimension.
They saved us!

1488
02:27:00,052 --> 02:27:03,576
Yeah? Well who the hell is 'They'?

1489
02:27:03,687 --> 02:27:05,813
And just why would they want to help us?

1490
02:27:05,894 --> 02:27:08,979
I don't know, but they constructed
this three-dimensional space...

1491
02:27:08,980 --> 02:27:13,716
...inside their five dimensional
reality to allow you to understand it.
-Yeah well it ain't working.

1492
02:27:13,792 --> 02:27:19,909
Yes it is. You've seen that time,
is represented as a physical dimension.

1493
02:27:20,029 --> 02:27:24,585
You've worked out that you can exert a force
across spacetime.
-Gravity...

1494
02:27:25,629 --> 02:27:28,246
...to send a message?
-Affirmative.

1495
02:27:30,187 --> 02:27:32,157
Gravity...

1496
02:27:32,273 --> 02:27:36,731
...can cross the dimensions, including time?

1497
02:27:37,006 --> 02:27:38,268
-Apparently.

1498
02:27:42,056 --> 02:27:45,974
Do you have the quantum data?
-Roger, I have it.

1499
02:27:46,084 --> 02:27:49,421
I've translated it on all wavelengths...

1500
02:27:49,422 --> 02:27:53,583
...but nothing is getting out Cooper.
-I can do this, I can.

1501
02:27:53,632 --> 02:27:58,266
But such complicated data to a child?
-Not just any child.

1502
02:28:00,106 --> 02:28:01,937
Come on dad!

1503
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:06,736
Murph, the fire's out! Come on!

1504
02:28:06,807 --> 02:28:10,498
Even though you communicate it here,
she won't understand it's significance for years!

1505
02:28:10,661 --> 02:28:15,530
No, no, I get that TARS, but
we've got to figure something out alright...

1506
02:28:15,642 --> 02:28:18,273
...or the people on Earth are gonna die!
Think, think, think!

1507
02:28:18,546 --> 02:28:22,152
Cooper, they didn't bring
us here to change the past.

1508
02:28:25,818 --> 02:28:30,717
Say that again.
-They didn't bring us here, to change the past.

1509
02:28:34,929 --> 02:28:37,737
No, they didn't bring us here at all.

1510
02:28:42,860 --> 02:28:43,812
We brought ourselves!

1511
02:28:52,975 --> 02:28:57,385
TARS, give me the coordinates for NASA, in binary.

1512
02:28:57,512 --> 02:28:59,843
In binary, roger, translating data.

1513
02:29:23,544 --> 02:29:26,316
It's not a ghost.

1514
02:29:27,254 --> 02:29:31,761
It's gravity.
-Don't you get it yet TARS?

1515
02:29:31,874 --> 02:29:33,714
I brought myself here!

1516
02:29:34,211 --> 02:29:38,161
We're here to communicate,
with the three dimensional world!

1517
02:29:38,698 --> 02:29:39,998
We are the bridge!

1518
02:29:47,177 --> 02:29:50,272
I thought they chose me.

1519
02:29:52,900 --> 02:29:56,908
But they didn't choose me, they chose her!
-For what Cooper?

1520
02:29:59,402 --> 02:30:01,021
To save the world!

1521
02:30:05,058 --> 02:30:09,185
All of this! In one, little girl's bedroom.

1522
02:30:09,297 --> 02:30:11,719
Every moment, it's infinitely complex.

1523
02:30:11,826 --> 02:30:14,819
They have access to infinite time and space...

1524
02:30:14,820 --> 02:30:16,448
...but they're not bound by anything!

1525
02:30:16,577 --> 02:30:21,327
They can't find, a specific place in time.
They can't communicate.

1526
02:30:21,443 --> 02:30:25,100
That's why I'm here.
-I'm here to find a way...

1527
02:30:25,124 --> 02:30:28,256
...to tell Murph,
just like I found this moment.
-How Cooper?

1528
02:30:28,372 --> 02:30:29,928
Love TARS, love!

1529
02:30:30,040 --> 02:30:33,634
It's just like Brand said,
my connection with Murph, it is quantifiable.

1530
02:30:33,742 --> 02:30:36,245
It is the key. -Why are we here?

1531
02:30:37,440 --> 02:30:39,342
To find out how to tell.

1532
02:30:41,859 --> 02:30:43,621
The watch!

1533
02:30:46,655 --> 02:30:50,319
The watch!

1534
02:30:52,555 --> 02:30:55,714
Encode the data in the
movement of the second hand.

1535
02:30:59,139 --> 02:31:03,135
TARS, translate the data into Morse
and give it to me.

1536
02:31:03,208 --> 02:31:06,565
Translating the data to Morse.
Cooper, what if she never came back for it?

1537
02:31:07,903 --> 02:31:11,533
She will. She will.

1538
02:31:13,153 --> 02:31:16,935
He's coming Murph!

1539
02:31:18,052 --> 02:31:23,030
Okay, coming down!
-How do you know?

1540
02:31:26,489 --> 02:31:28,255
Because I gave it to her!

1541
02:31:32,902 --> 02:31:36,360
Roger Morse is dot dot dash dot,

1542
02:31:39,206 --> 02:31:44,093
Dot, dot, dash, dot,

1543
02:31:44,168 --> 02:31:46,405
dot, dash, dot, dot,

1544
02:31:46,481 --> 02:31:51,161
dot, dash, dot, dot,

1545
02:31:51,236 --> 02:31:54,183


1546
02:31:22,073 --> 02:31:25,995
It was him!!

1547
02:32:15,108 --> 02:32:18,418
All the time!!
I knew it!!!

1548
02:32:18,504 --> 02:32:20,687
Dad saved us!!

1549
02:32:59,146 --> 02:33:00,357


1550
02:32:14,946 --> 02:32:17,570
Eureka!!!

1551
02:33:09,022 --> 02:33:10,930
It's traditional.

1552
02:33:15,042 --> 02:33:16,805
Eureka!!!

1553
02:33:21,559 --> 02:33:24,955
Did it work?
-I think it might have.

1554
02:33:26,325 --> 02:33:27,981
How do you know?

1555
02:33:28,061 --> 02:33:31,505
Because, the bulk beings
are closing the Tesseract.

1556
02:33:35,333 --> 02:33:37,345
Don't you get it yet TARS?

1557
02:33:37,418 --> 02:33:40,729
They're not beings.

1558
02:33:40,805 --> 02:33:42,495
They're us!

1559
02:33:44,009 --> 02:33:47,781
What I've been doing for Murph,
they've been doing for me!

1560
02:33:47,896 --> 02:33:51,775
For all of us.
-Cooper, people couldn't build this.

1561
02:33:51,851 --> 02:33:56,388
No, no. Not yet. But one day.

1562
02:33:56,539 --> 02:34:00,416
Not you and me. But people.

1563
02:34:00,488 --> 02:34:06,138
A civilization that's evolved
past the 4 dimensions that we know.

1564
02:34:11,693 --> 02:34:12,805
What happens now?

1565
02:35:15,773 --> 02:35:16,638
Mr. Cooper.

1566
02:35:21,281 --> 02:35:25,069
Let's take it slow sir.
Nice and easy Mr. Cooper.

1567
02:35:25,181 --> 02:35:27,949
Remember you're no spring chicken anymore.

1568
02:35:28,059 --> 02:35:30,502
Actually you are one hundred and twenty four years old.

1569
02:35:37,539 --> 02:35:39,155
Take it slow sir.

1570
02:35:40,614 --> 02:35:42,128
You were, um, extremely lucky.

1571
02:35:42,236 --> 02:35:46,513
The Rangers found you with only minutes
left in your oxygen supply.

1572
02:35:58,516 --> 02:36:01,290
Where am I?

1573
02:36:03,204 --> 02:36:04,787
Cooper station.

1574
02:36:06,050 --> 02:36:07,713
Currently orbiting Saturn.

1575
02:36:08,947 --> 02:36:11,690
Cooper station?

1576
02:36:14,448 --> 02:36:16,887
What nice of you to name it after me!

1577
02:36:19,942 --> 02:36:23,526
What?
-Well, the station isn't named after you sir,

1578
02:36:23,640 --> 02:36:25,100
It's uh, it's named after your daughter.

1579
02:36:25,115 --> 02:36:29,539
Although she's always maintained
just how important you were.
-Is she still alive?

1580
02:36:29,613 --> 02:36:33,477
She'll be here in a couple of weeks.

1581
02:36:34,567 --> 02:36:37,817
She is far too old to be
transferred from another station...

1582
02:36:37,891 --> 02:36:40,122
...but when she heard that you'd been found.

1583
02:36:40,229 --> 02:36:43,756
Well this is, this is
Murphy Cooper we're talking about!

1584
02:36:43,867 --> 02:36:45,741
Yes it is!

1585
02:36:48,222 --> 02:36:50,244
We'll have you checked out of here
in a couple of days.

1586
02:36:53,301 --> 02:36:55,869
I'm sure you'll be excited to see what's in store.

1587
02:36:56,522 --> 02:37:01,396
I actually uhh, did a paper on you,
in high school,

1588
02:37:01,504 --> 02:37:03,132
I know all about your life back on Earth.

1589
02:37:04,931 --> 02:37:07,632
Oh yeah, right.

1590
02:37:09,004 --> 02:37:15,365
Sir, if you could follow me?
You've got a really good situation.

1591
02:37:19,147 --> 02:37:22,537
So um, when I made my suggestion to Ms. Cooper,

1592
02:37:23,873 --> 02:37:26,817
I was delighted to hear that she thought it was perfect.

1593
02:37:33,438 --> 02:37:37,200
Well of course, I didn't speak to her in person.

1594
02:37:41,429 --> 02:37:46,313
My dad was a farmer.
Like everybody else back then.

1595
02:37:46,422 --> 02:37:49,641
Anyway, there just wasn't enough food.

1596
02:37:49,753 --> 02:37:55,727
We had strips of sheet to
cover our nose and mouth.

1597
02:37:56,021 --> 02:37:58,284
So we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

1598
02:37:58,358 --> 02:38:01,302


1599
02:37:12,412 --> 02:37:16,944


1600
02:37:17,025 --> 02:37:19,677
She did confirm, just how much you loved farming.

1601
02:38:08,758 --> 02:38:11,141
She did? Did she?

1602
02:38:11,215 --> 02:38:14,529
Well, home sweet home!

1603
02:38:14,601 --> 02:38:18,229
Everything is in its place and
faithfully reproduced.

1604
02:38:18,310 --> 02:38:19,695
Yes.

1605
02:38:24,244 --> 02:38:29,517
Hey, is this? -Oh yeah, the machine
we found out near Saturn with you.

1606
02:38:29,630 --> 02:38:32,994
It's power source is shot,
but we can get another one if you want.

1607
02:38:33,103 --> 02:38:34,863
Yes, please!

1608
02:38:36,126 --> 02:38:36,908
Settings.

1609
02:38:38,105 --> 02:38:39,053
General settings.

1610
02:38:40,097 --> 02:38:41,280
Security settings.

1611
02:38:43,408 --> 02:38:46,423
Honesty, new setting.

1612
02:38:47,658 --> 02:38:52,518
95%
Confirmed. Additional customization?

1613
02:38:52,592 --> 02:38:57,272
Humor: 75%

1614
02:38:57,382 --> 02:38:58,935
Confirmed.

1615
02:38:59,046 --> 02:39:03,053
Auto self destruct T minus 10, 9...

1616
02:39:03,158 --> 02:39:04,740
Let's make that 60%.

1617
02:39:06,514 --> 02:39:09,317
60% confirmed.

1618
02:39:09,390 --> 02:39:13,138
Knock Knock. -You want 55?

1619
02:39:17,503 --> 02:39:19,503
Is this really what it was like?

1620
02:39:21,845 --> 02:39:24,549
It was never this clean slick.

1621
02:39:29,270 --> 02:39:33,793
I don't care much for this, pretending
we are back where we started.

1622
02:39:34,622 --> 02:39:36,853
I want to know where we are?

1623
02:39:37,978 --> 02:39:40,309
Where are we going?

1624
02:39:45,183 --> 02:39:47,645
Mr Cooper. -Yes?
-The family is all in there.

1625
02:39:47,802 --> 02:39:49,433
Family?

1626
02:39:49,544 --> 02:39:53,392
Yeah, they all came out to see her.
She's been in cryo sleep for almost 2 years.

1627
02:40:26,034 --> 02:40:28,800
You told them I liked farming?

1628
02:40:34,241 --> 02:40:35,393
It was me Murph!

1629
02:40:37,839 --> 02:40:40,250
I was your ghost!

1630
02:40:41,300 --> 02:40:42,774
I know.

1631
02:40:44,901 --> 02:40:50,545
People didn't believe me,
they thought I was doing it all myself. But...

1632
02:40:53,721 --> 02:40:56,134
...I knew who it was.

1633
02:41:00,277 --> 02:41:02,368
Nobody believed me.

1634
02:41:02,487 --> 02:41:05,431
But I knew you'd come back.

1635
02:41:07,234 --> 02:41:08,849
How?

1636
02:41:10,190 --> 02:41:14,150
Because my dad promised me!

1637
02:41:20,540 --> 02:41:24,642
I'm here now Murph.
I'm here!

1638
02:41:26,450 --> 02:41:33,894
No. No parent should have
to watch their own child die.

1639
02:41:36,028 --> 02:41:40,166
I have my kids here for me now.

1640
02:41:42,436 --> 02:41:44,505
You go!

1641
02:41:47,058 --> 02:41:47,994
Where?

1642
02:41:51,352 --> 02:41:53,479
Brand.

1643
02:42:02,505 --> 02:42:05,299
She's, out there.

1644
02:42:09,863 --> 02:42:12,829
Setting up camp.

1645
02:42:39,381 --> 02:42:44,814
Alone, in a strange galaxy.

1646
02:42:55,554 --> 02:42:59,023
Maybe right now she's, settling in...

1647
02:42:59,058 --> 02:43:01,378
...for the long nap.

1648
02:43:17,324 --> 02:43:21,753
By the light of our new sun.

1649
02:43:36,669 --> 02:43:39,369
In our new home.

1650
02:43:42,369 --> 02:43:46,369
