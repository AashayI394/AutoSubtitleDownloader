tt0104257,"00:14:48,680","00:14:51,723",You haven't talked to a witness or looked at a piece of paper.
tt0104257,"00:14:52,141","00:14:53,892","Pretty impressive, huh?"
tt0104257,"00:14:54,060","00:14:55,644",You'll have to go deeper than that.
tt0104257,"00:14:55,812","00:14:58,480",Do you have some jurisdiction here I should know about?
tt0104257,"00:14:58,648","00:15:01,275",My job is to make sure that you do your job.
tt0104257,"00:15:01,442","00:15:06,822",I'm special counsel for Internal Affairs. So my jurisdiction's in your face.
tt0104257,"00:15:09,075","00:15:12,077",Read the letters. I'll expect a report when you return from Cuba.
tt0104257,"00:15:12,620","00:15:14,830",-Sure. -You're dismissed!
tt0104257,"00:15:17,041","00:15:19,418",I always forget that part.
tt0104257,"00:15:21,337","00:15:23,714",He's a little preoccupied.
tt0104257,"00:15:23,881","00:15:26,842",Team's playing Bethesda Medical next week.
tt0104257,"00:15:27,010","00:15:31,597",Tell your friend not to get cute. Guantánamo Marines are fanatical.
tt0104257,"00:15:31,764","00:15:35,350",#NAME?
tt0104257,"00:15:35,518","00:15:39,313","Dear sir, my name is PFC William T. Santiago."
tt0104257,"00:15:39,480","00:15:41,523",I'm a Marine stationed at Marine barracks...
tt0104257,"00:15:41,691","00:15:45,152","...Rifle Security Company Windward, 2nd Platoon Bravo."
tt0104257,"00:15:45,320","00:15:48,822",l am writing to inform you of my problems here in Cuba...
tt0104257,"00:15:48,990","00:15:50,574",...and to ask for your help.
tt0104257,"00:15:50,742","00:15:56,038","I've fallen out of runs before, because of dizziness or nausea."
tt0104257,"00:15:56,205","00:15:59,791","But on May 18th, I'd fallen back about 20 yards..."
tt0104257,"00:15:59,959","00:16:02,502","...going down a rocky, unstable hill."
tt0104257,"00:16:02,670","00:16:05,422",My sergeant grabbed me and pushed me down the hill...
tt0104257,"00:16:05,590","00:16:09,426",...then I saw all black and the last thing I remember is hitting the deck.
tt0104257,"00:16:09,636","00:16:12,846",I was brought to the hospital. They said it was heat exhaustion.
tt0104257,"00:16:13,014","00:16:18,101","I ask you to help me. Please, l need a transfer out of RSC."
tt0104257,"00:16:18,269","00:16:22,689","Sincerely, PFC William T. Santiago, U.S. Marine Corps."
tt0104257,"00:16:22,857","00:16:26,860","P.S. In exchange for my transfer, I'm willing to provide you...."
tt0104257,"00:16:27,028","00:16:32,074",“--with information about an illegal fenceline shooting on August 2nd.”
tt0104257,"00:16:33,076","00:16:37,371",Who the fuck is PFC William T. Santiago?
tt0104257,"00:16:37,580","00:16:40,582","Private Santiago's a member of 2nd Platoon Bravo, sir."
tt0104257,"00:16:40,750","00:16:44,920",Yeah. Apparently he's not very happy down here at Shangri-la...
tt0104257,"00:16:45,088","00:16:49,925","...because he's written everybody but Santa Claus, asking for a transfer."
tt0104257,"00:16:50,093","00:16:55,597",Now he's telling tales about a fenceline shooting. Matthew?
tt0104257,"00:16:56,057","00:17:01,478","-I'm appalled, sir. -You're appalled."
tt0104257,"00:17:02,563","00:17:05,941",This kid broke the chain of command and ratted on a member of his unit...
tt0104257,"00:17:06,109","00:17:09,319",...to say nothing of the fact that he's a U.S. Marine...
tt0104257,"00:17:09,487","00:17:14,616",...and it would appear he can't run from here to there without collapsing.
tt0104257,"00:17:14,784","00:17:17,953","What the fuck is going on in Bravo company, Matthew?"
tt0104257,"00:17:18,121","00:17:21,039","Colonel, I think it would be better to discuss it in private."
tt0104257,"00:17:21,207","00:17:25,252","That won't be necessary. I can handle this situation, sir."
tt0104257,"00:17:25,420","00:17:27,754","-Like you handled Curtis Bell? -Sir, your methods--"
tt0104257,"00:17:27,922","00:17:30,590","Don't interrupt me, lieutenant, I'm your superior!"
tt0104257,"00:17:30,758","00:17:32,634","And I'm yours, Matthew."
tt0104257,"00:17:34,637","00:17:37,889",I wanna know what we're going to do about this.
tt0104257,"00:17:38,057","00:17:40,892",I think Santiago should be transferred immediately.
tt0104257,"00:17:41,060","00:17:42,644",He's that bad?
tt0104257,"00:17:42,812","00:17:46,815","And word of this letter will get out, and he'll get his ass whipped."
tt0104257,"00:17:48,609","00:17:52,779",Transfer Santiago? Yes.
tt0104257,"00:17:52,947","00:17:57,075","Sure, you're right. I'm sure that's the thing to do."
tt0104257,"00:17:58,828","00:18:02,831","Wait. Wait, I've got a better idea."
tt0104257,"00:18:02,999","00:18:06,793",Let's transfer the whole squad off the base. Let's....
tt0104257,"00:18:06,961","00:18:09,004","On second thought, Windward."
tt0104257,"00:18:09,172","00:18:13,300",Let's transfer the whole Windward division off the base.
tt0104257,"00:18:13,468","00:18:18,722","Jon, go get those boys off the fence. They're packing their bags."
tt0104257,"00:18:18,890","00:18:21,433",-Tom! -Sir?
tt0104257,"00:18:21,601","00:18:23,477",Get me the president on the phone.
tt0104257,"00:18:23,644","00:18:26,271",We're surrendering our position in Cuba.
tt0104257,"00:18:26,439","00:18:28,774",#NAME?
tt0104257,"00:18:28,941","00:18:34,696",Don't get the president yet. Maybe we should consider this for a second.
tt0104257,"00:18:34,864","00:18:36,823",#NAME?
tt0104257,"00:18:38,201","00:18:41,870",Maybe-- And I'm just spit-balling here.
tt0104257,"00:18:42,038","00:18:46,875",Maybe we have a responsibility as officers to train Santiago.
tt0104257,"00:18:47,084","00:18:51,338","Maybe we, as officers, have a responsibility to this country..."
tt0104257,"00:18:51,506","00:18:54,925",...to see that the men and women charged with its security...
tt0104257,"00:18:55,092","00:18:56,885",...are trained professionals.
tt0104257,"00:18:57,053","00:19:00,722","Yes, I'm certain that I read that somewhere once."
tt0104257,"00:19:00,890","00:19:03,475","And now I'm thinking, Colonel Markinson..."
tt0104257,"00:19:03,643","00:19:07,729",...that your suggestion of transferring Santiago...
tt0104257,"00:19:07,897","00:19:11,107",...while expeditious and certainly painless...
tt0104257,"00:19:11,317","00:19:16,613","...might not be, in a manner of speaking, the American way."
tt0104257,"00:19:16,823","00:19:21,076",Santiago stays where he is.
tt0104257,"00:19:21,244","00:19:26,456","We're gonna train the lad. Jon, you're in charge."
tt0104257,"00:19:26,624","00:19:33,421","Santiago doesn't make 4.6, 4.6 on his next proficiency report..."
tt0104257,"00:19:33,589","00:19:35,924",...I'm going to blame you.
tt0104257,"00:19:36,092","00:19:38,552","-Then I'm going to kill you. -Yes, sir."
tt0104257,"00:19:38,928","00:19:41,221","I think that's a mistake, colonel."
tt0104257,"00:19:42,765","00:19:46,935","Matthew, I think I will have that word in private with you now."
tt0104257,"00:19:47,103","00:19:50,772","Jon, that's all. Why don't we meet at the “O” Club and have lunch..."
tt0104257,"00:19:50,940","00:19:53,650",...and we'll talk about the training of young William.
tt0104257,"00:19:53,860","00:19:56,528",I'd be delighted to hear your suggestions.
tt0104257,"00:19:56,696","00:19:58,405",Dismissed.
tt0104257,"00:20:02,243","00:20:05,287","Matthew, sit down. Please."
tt0104257,"00:20:10,793","00:20:14,963",-What do you think of Kendrick? -I don't think my opinion of Kendrick--
tt0104257,"00:20:15,131","00:20:18,300",I think he's pretty much of a weasel myself.
tt0104257,"00:20:18,467","00:20:20,260",But he's an awfully good officer...
tt0104257,"00:20:20,428","00:20:24,764","...and in the end, we see eye to eye on the best way to run a Marine unit."
tt0104257,"00:20:24,974","00:20:28,310","We're in the business of saving lives, Matthew."
tt0104257,"00:20:28,477","00:20:32,147",That is a responsibility that we have to take pretty seriously.
tt0104257,"00:20:32,315","00:20:36,526",And I believe that taking a Marine who is not up to the job...
tt0104257,"00:20:36,694","00:20:41,156",...and shipping him off to another assignment puts lives in danger.
tt0104257,"00:20:41,991","00:20:44,159","Sit down, Matthew."
tt0104257,"00:20:53,794","00:20:55,921",We go back a while.
tt0104257,"00:20:56,088","00:20:58,214",We went to the Academy together...
tt0104257,"00:20:58,382","00:21:01,843","...were commissioned together, did our tours in Vietnam together."
tt0104257,"00:21:02,428","00:21:07,974",But I've been promoted with greater speed and success than you.
tt0104257,"00:21:08,142","00:21:12,145","Now, if that's a source of tension or embarrassment for you..."
tt0104257,"00:21:12,313","00:21:14,189",...I don't give a shit.
tt0104257,"00:21:14,357","00:21:19,569","We're in the business of saving lives, Lieutenant Colonel Markinson."
tt0104257,"00:21:19,737","00:21:23,615",Don't ever question my orders in front of another officer.
tt0104257,"00:21:43,594","00:21:48,890",All the paperwork's in order. Step over there.
tt0104257,"00:21:52,770","00:21:56,815","-Hal, is this Washington D.C.? -All right, let's move."
tt0104257,"00:21:56,983","00:21:58,775","Yes, sir."
tt0104257,"00:22:05,992","00:22:07,450",Got all of that one.
tt0104257,"00:22:07,618","00:22:12,205",Excuse me. I wanted to talk to you about Dawson and Downey.
tt0104257,"00:22:12,373","00:22:16,126",#NAME?
tt0104257,"00:22:16,293","00:22:18,169","The names seem familiar, but...."
tt0104257,"00:22:18,421","00:22:21,047",Dawson. Downey. Your clients?
tt0104257,"00:22:21,215","00:22:24,426","The Cuba thing! Yes! Oh, Dawson and Downey. Right."
tt0104257,"00:22:27,263","00:22:29,681","I've done something wrong again, haven't I?"
tt0104257,"00:22:29,849","00:22:34,602",I was wondering why they're locked up while their lawyer's out hitting a ball.
tt0104257,"00:22:36,772","00:22:39,941",-We need the practice. -That wasn't funny.
tt0104257,"00:22:40,693","00:22:42,068",It was a little funny.
tt0104257,"00:22:42,236","00:22:47,490","Lieutenant, would you be very insulted if I recommended different counsel?"
tt0104257,"00:22:47,658","00:22:50,952",-Why? -I don't think you're fit to handle it.
tt0104257,"00:22:51,579","00:22:57,459",You don't even know me. Ordinarily it takes someone hours to find that out.
tt0104257,"00:22:59,670","00:23:02,589","Oh, come on. That was damn funny."
tt0104257,"00:23:05,593","00:23:09,846",You're wrong. I do know you.
tt0104257,"00:23:10,056","00:23:13,475","Daniel Alistair Kaffee, born June 8th, 1964..."
tt0104257,"00:23:13,642","00:23:15,602",...at Boston Mercy Hospital.
tt0104257,"00:23:15,770","00:23:20,523","Your father's Lionel Kaffee, former Attorney General of the U.S..."
tt0104257,"00:23:20,691","00:23:22,317",...died 1985.
tt0104257,"00:23:22,568","00:23:25,320","You went to Harvard Law, then joined the Navy..."
tt0104257,"00:23:25,488","00:23:27,989",...probably because that's what your father wanted.
tt0104257,"00:23:28,157","00:23:31,785",Now you're just treading water for the three years in the JAG corps...
tt0104257,"00:23:31,952","00:23:34,954",...just laying low till you can get out and get a real job.
tt0104257,"00:23:35,122","00:23:38,583","If that's the situation, that's fine, I won't tell anyone."
tt0104257,"00:23:38,751","00:23:43,713","But if this case is handled in the same fast-food, slick-assed manner..."
tt0104257,"00:23:43,881","00:23:45,799",...with which you handle everything else...
tt0104257,"00:23:45,966","00:23:47,550",...then something's gonna get missed.
tt0104257,"00:23:47,718","00:23:52,889",And I wouldn't be doing my job if I let Dawson and Downey to sit in prison...
tt0104257,"00:23:53,099","00:23:57,519",...because their attorney predetermined the path of least resistance.
tt0104257,"00:24:01,398","00:24:04,025","I'm sexually aroused, commander."
tt0104257,"00:24:04,693","00:24:06,945",I don't think your clients murdered anyone.
tt0104257,"00:24:07,113","00:24:10,365",#NAME?
tt0104257,"00:24:10,533","00:24:13,243",Doctor's report says Santiago died of asphyxiation...
tt0104257,"00:24:13,410","00:24:15,078",...from acute lactic acidosis...
tt0104257,"00:24:15,246","00:24:18,915",...and the nature of the acidosis strongly suggests poisoning.
tt0104257,"00:24:19,083","00:24:21,960","Now, I don't know what that means, but it sounds bad."
tt0104257,"00:24:22,128","00:24:26,673","Santiago died at 1 a.m. At 3, the doctor didn't know the reason."
tt0104257,"00:24:26,841","00:24:29,050","Two hours later, he said it was poison."
tt0104257,"00:24:29,218","00:24:31,553","Oh, now I see what you're saying."
tt0104257,"00:24:31,720","00:24:35,056","It had to be Professor Plum, in the library, with the candlestick."
tt0104257,"00:24:35,224","00:24:37,559",I'm gonna talk to your supervisor.
tt0104257,"00:24:37,726","00:24:42,397",Go straight up Pennsylvania Avenue. It's the big white house with the pillars.
tt0104257,"00:24:42,982","00:24:45,316",-Thank you. -I don't think you'll have much luck.
tt0104257,"00:24:45,484","00:24:50,238",I was assigned by Division. Somebody thinks I'm a good lawyer.
tt0104257,"00:24:50,406","00:24:56,411","So, while I appreciate your interest and enthusiasm, I think I can handle things."
tt0104257,"00:24:56,579","00:24:58,580",You know what a Code Red is?
tt0104257,"00:25:02,751","00:25:04,586",What a pity.

tt0104257,"00:39:41,463","00:39:44,965","Private Santiago is dead, and that is a tragedy."
tt0104257,"00:39:45,133","00:39:47,176",But he is dead because he had no code...
tt0104257,"00:39:47,343","00:39:51,597",...and no honor. And God was watching.
tt0104257,"00:39:54,267","00:39:58,145",-How do you feel about that theory? -Sounds good. Let's move on.
tt0104257,"00:39:58,313","00:40:03,859","Are you planning on investigating, or you just gonna take the guided tour?"
tt0104257,"00:40:04,069","00:40:06,653",I'm pacing myself.

tt0104257,"00:40:33,348","00:40:39,978",An NIS agent told you that Santiago tipped him off to a fenceline shooting.
tt0104257,"00:40:40,146","00:40:43,190",Santiago was gonna reveal who did it in exchange for a transfer.
tt0104257,"00:40:43,358","00:40:45,526",Yes.
tt0104257,"00:40:47,821","00:40:53,700","If you feel there are any details that I'm missing, feel free to speak up."

tt0104257,"00:41:01,543","00:41:03,919",You called Lt. Colonel Markinson...
tt0104257,"00:41:04,087","00:41:07,005",...and Lt. Kendrick into your office. Is that right?

tt0104257,"00:41:09,676","00:41:15,389","We agreed that, for his own safety, Santiago should be transferred."

tt0104257,"00:41:55,930","00:42:02,561","-Have you heard the term Code Red? -I've heard the term, yes."

tt0104257,"00:42:11,654","00:42:13,238",...wasn't to be condoned.
tt0104257,"00:42:13,406","00:42:16,158",I submit to you that whoever wrote that memo...
tt0104257,"00:42:16,326","00:42:22,122",...has never faced the working end of a Cuban AK-47 assault rifle.
tt0104257,"00:42:22,290","00:42:25,792","However, the directive, having come from the commander..."
tt0104257,"00:42:25,960","00:42:27,753",...I gave it its due attention.

tt0104257,"00:42:29,422","00:42:34,092","She has no point, it's part of her charm. We're out of here. Thank you."
tt0104257,"00:42:34,260","00:42:39,806",My point is that I think Code Reds still go on. Do they?
tt0104257,"00:42:39,974","00:42:42,309","-He doesn't need to answer that. -Yes, he does."
tt0104257,"00:42:42,518","00:42:46,021","-No, he really doesn't. -Yeah, he really does."

tt0104257,"00:43:24,435","00:43:28,063","The practice of Code Reds is still condoned on this base, isn't it?"
tt0104257,"00:43:28,273","00:43:31,483","My problem is I'm a colonel, so I'll just have to take cold showers..."

tt0104257,"00:43:47,542","00:43:49,293",You wanna ask me about Code Reds?

tt0104257,"00:43:52,213","00:43:54,214",...in accordance with the directive.
tt0104257,"00:43:54,382","00:43:59,428","Off the record, I tell you it is an invaluable part of infantry training."
tt0104257,"00:43:59,595","00:44:06,393","If it goes on without my knowledge, so be it. That's how I run my unit."

tt0104257,"00:44:11,232","00:44:15,610",I eat breakfast 300 yards from 4000 Cubans who are trained to kill me.

tt0104257,"00:44:37,342","00:44:40,594",Santiago's transfer order. You guys have paperwork on it.
tt0104257,"00:44:40,762","00:44:42,387",I just need it for the file.

tt0104257,"00:44:47,560","00:44:51,938",Of course you can have a copy of the transfer order for the file.

tt0104257,"00:45:00,365","00:45:01,698",Of course.
tt0104257,"00:45:02,450","00:45:07,120",The corporal will take you by Personnel on your way to the flight line...

tt0104257,"00:45:12,460","00:45:14,461",But you have to ask me nicely.

tt0104257,"00:45:28,142","00:45:30,685",What I do want is for you to stand there...

tt0104257,"00:47:05,239","00:47:10,911",You're coming close to interfering with a government investigation.
tt0104257,"00:47:11,078","00:47:17,417",I'm Louden Downey's attorney. Aunt Ginny feels like she knows me.
tt0104257,"00:47:17,585","00:47:22,005",So I suggested that I get more directly involved with the case.
tt0104257,"00:47:22,173","00:47:25,717",She had Louden sign the papers about an hour ago.
tt0104257,"00:47:25,885","00:47:30,055",I suppose it's too much to hope that you're making this up just to bother me.

tt0104257,"00:48:23,985","00:48:28,488",-At ease. Let's sort this thing out. -Shit.
tt0104257,"00:48:28,656","00:48:31,950",There was a platoon meeting on September 6th at 4 p.m.
tt0104257,"00:48:32,118","00:48:36,454",Lieutenant Kendrick says he told you nothing was to happen to Santiago.
tt0104257,"00:48:37,081","00:48:42,294","Now, is this true? I want you to speak freely."
tt0104257,"00:48:45,214","00:48:49,509","Ma'am, that's correct. But then he dismissed the platoon."

tt0104257,"00:49:03,316","00:49:07,527",Lt. Kendrick ordered us to give Santiago a Code Red.
tt0104257,"00:49:09,196","00:49:13,617",Jack! Jack! They were given an order.

tt0104257,"00:49:41,187","00:49:43,355",...and testify for the record they were ordered.
tt0104257,"00:49:43,522","00:49:46,650",Kendrick told those men not to touch Santiago.
tt0104257,"00:49:46,817","00:49:50,904",Then he told Dawson and Downey to give him a Code Red. Kendrick's lying.

tt0104257,"00:50:17,598","00:50:21,393",Division will give me room to spare him and the Corps any embarrassment.
tt0104257,"00:50:21,560","00:50:22,769",How much room?
tt0104257,"00:50:24,063","00:50:27,524",I'll knock it down to involuntary manslaughter. Two years.
tt0104257,"00:50:27,692","00:50:28,942","No, we're going to court."
tt0104257,"00:50:29,110","00:50:30,944","-No, you're not. -Why not?"
tt0104257,"00:50:31,112","00:50:34,030","Because you'll lose, and Danny knows it."
tt0104257,"00:50:34,198","00:50:37,117","And he knows if we go to court, I'll have to go all the way."
tt0104257,"00:50:37,284","00:50:39,536",They'll be charged with the whole truckload.
tt0104257,"00:50:39,704","00:50:42,205","Murder, conspiracy, conduct unbecoming."
tt0104257,"00:50:42,373","00:50:47,127","Danny's got me by the balls here, but not in the courtroom."
tt0104257,"00:50:47,294","00:50:49,087",Danny's an awfully talented lawyer.
tt0104257,"00:50:49,255","00:50:54,134",He won't see his clients go jail for life if they could be home in six months.
tt0104257,"00:50:54,802","00:51:00,056",That's the end of this negotiation. I'll see you at the arraignment.
tt0104257,"00:51:03,477","00:51:06,104","All right, here's the story."
tt0104257,"00:51:06,272","00:51:11,151",The government's offering involuntary manslaughter. Two years.

tt0104257,"01:05:39,436","01:05:43,522",Is the government prepared to make an opening statement?
tt0104257,"01:05:46,610","01:05:48,485",The facts of the case are these:
tt0104257,"01:05:48,653","01:05:54,700","On September 6th, the accused entered PFC Santiago's room."
tt0104257,"01:05:54,868","01:05:57,703","They woke him up, tied his arms and legs..."
tt0104257,"01:05:57,871","01:06:00,205",...and forced a rag into his throat.
tt0104257,"01:06:00,373","01:06:06,045","Minutes later, a reaction called lactic acidosis caused his lungs to bleed."
tt0104257,"01:06:06,212","01:06:11,717","He drowned in his own blood, and was dead at 37 minutes past midnight."
tt0104257,"01:06:11,885","01:06:16,889","These are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed."
tt0104257,"01:06:17,057","01:06:22,353",That's right. What I've just told you is exactly what you will hear...
tt0104257,"01:06:22,520","01:06:27,107",...from Lance Corporal Dawson and Private Downey.
tt0104257,"01:06:27,275","01:06:32,321","Furthermore, we will also show that the accused soaked the rag in poison..."
tt0104257,"01:06:32,489","01:06:37,826",...and entered Santiago's room with motive and intent to kill.
tt0104257,"01:06:37,994","01:06:43,374",Lieutenant Kaffee is gonna try and pull off a little magic act here.
tt0104257,"01:06:43,541","01:06:45,584",He'll try a little misdirection.
tt0104257,"01:06:46,044","01:06:49,296",He'll astonish you with stories of rituals.
tt0104257,"01:06:49,464","01:06:55,678",Dazzle you with official-sounding terms like “Code Red.”
tt0104257,"01:06:55,845","01:06:58,806",He might even try to cut into a few officers for you.
tt0104257,"01:06:58,973","01:07:03,727","He'll have no evidence, none, but it'll be entertaining."
tt0104257,"01:07:03,978","01:07:05,396",But in the end...
tt0104257,"01:07:05,563","01:07:10,150",...all the magic in the world will not divert your attention from the fact...
tt0104257,"01:07:10,318","01:07:17,241","...that Willy Santiago is dead, and Dawson and Downey killed him."
tt0104257,"01:07:17,409","01:07:21,245","These are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed."
tt0104257,"01:07:22,372","01:07:24,081",Lieutenant Kaffee.
tt0104257,"01:07:24,249","01:07:27,251",There was no poison on the rag and there was no intent to kill...
tt0104257,"01:07:27,419","01:07:31,463","...and any attempt to prove otherwise is futile, because it just ain't true."
tt0104257,"01:07:32,048","01:07:35,300",Dawson and Downey didn't go into Santiago's room...
tt0104257,"01:07:35,468","01:07:37,678",...because of vengeance.
tt0104257,"01:07:37,887","01:07:41,849",It wasn't to kill or harm. And they weren't looking for kicks.
tt0104257,"01:07:42,016","01:07:45,310",It's because it was what they were ordered to do.
tt0104257,"01:07:45,895","01:07:50,482",Let me say that again. It's because they were ordered to do it.
tt0104257,"01:07:51,109","01:07:52,985","Out in the real world, that means nothing."
tt0104257,"01:07:53,153","01:07:55,487",And here in the Washington Navy Yard...
tt0104257,"01:07:55,655","01:07:57,281",...doesn't mean a whole lot more.
tt0104257,"01:07:57,449","01:07:58,991",But if you're a Marine...
tt0104257,"01:07:59,159","01:08:03,454","...assigned to Rifle Security Company Windward, Guantánamo Bay, Cuba..."
tt0104257,"01:08:03,621","01:08:06,999","...you follow orders, or you pack your bags."
tt0104257,"01:08:07,208","01:08:12,421",Make no mistake about it. Dawson and Downey are sitting here...
tt0104257,"01:08:12,589","01:08:15,841",...because they did their job.
tt0104257,"01:08:19,429","01:08:22,514",Is the government ready to call its first witness?
tt0104257,"01:08:22,682","01:08:26,351","Please the court, government calls Mr. R.C. Mc.Guire."
tt0104257,"01:08:30,857","01:08:33,025","Raise your right hand, please."
tt0104257,"01:08:33,193","01:08:38,864","Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?"
tt0104257,"01:08:39,032","01:08:41,408",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:08:42,494","01:08:45,704",Would you state your full name and occupation?
tt0104257,"01:08:45,872","01:08:50,209","Robert C. Mc.Guire, special agent, Naval Investigative Service."
tt0104257,"01:08:50,376","01:08:56,715",Did you receive a letter from PFC Santiago on 3 September of this year?
tt0104257,"01:08:56,883","01:08:58,967",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:08:59,135","01:09:03,847",That a member of Santiago's unit had illegally fired across the fenceline.
tt0104257,"01:09:04,015","01:09:06,058",Was that Marine identified in the letter?
tt0104257,"01:09:06,226","01:09:11,730",No. I told Colonel Jessep that I would be coming down to investigate.
tt0104257,"01:09:11,898","01:09:13,565",And what did you find?
tt0104257,"01:09:13,733","01:09:16,819",The shift reported only one sentry returned his weapon...
tt0104257,"01:09:16,986","01:09:18,529",...with ammo missing.
tt0104257,"01:09:18,696","01:09:21,990",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:09:22,158","01:09:23,742",Your Witness.
tt0104257,"01:09:26,329","01:09:29,665","Mr. McGuire, have you questioned Dawson about the shooting?"
tt0104257,"01:09:29,916","01:09:33,544","Yes, he claims to have been engaged in some manner by the enemy."
tt0104257,"01:09:33,711","01:09:35,963",-But you don't believe him? -It's not my place--
tt0104257,"01:09:36,130","01:09:41,009",Why wasn't Dawson charged with firing at the enemy without cause?
tt0104257,"01:09:42,804","01:09:45,681",There wasn't enough evidence to support such a charge.
tt0104257,"01:09:45,849","01:09:47,474",Thank you.
tt0104257,"01:09:48,893","01:09:55,941",Why was there not enough evidence? You had William Santiago's letter.
tt0104257,"01:09:57,110","01:10:02,614",Santiago was the only eyewitness. I had no chance to interview him.
tt0104257,"01:10:02,782","01:10:05,784","And now we'll never know, will we, Mr. McGuire?"
tt0104257,"01:10:06,536","01:10:07,995",No.
tt0104257,"01:10:09,414","01:10:13,584",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:10:16,504","01:10:18,964","Corporal Carl Hammaker, Marine barracks..."
tt0104257,"01:10:19,132","01:10:22,467","...Rifle Security Company Windward, 2nd Platoon Bravo."
tt0104257,"01:10:22,635","01:10:24,970",Were you present at a meeting...
tt0104257,"01:10:25,138","01:10:29,433",...held by Lieutenant Kendrick on September 6th?
tt0104257,"01:10:29,601","01:10:33,478",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:10:33,646","01:10:36,690",Lieutenant Kendrick told us we had an informer in our group.
tt0104257,"01:10:36,858","01:10:42,487",That Santiago had reported to the NIS on a member of our platoon.
tt0104257,"01:10:42,655","01:10:44,865",Did that make you mad?
tt0104257,"01:10:45,033","01:10:48,327",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:10:48,494","01:10:49,661",How mad?
tt0104257,"01:10:49,829","01:10:53,582",Santiago betrayed a code we believe in.
tt0104257,"01:10:53,750","01:10:56,376",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:10:56,628","01:10:58,211",Were Dawson and Downey?
tt0104257,"01:10:58,463","01:11:00,714",Is the counsel asking this witness to testify...
tt0104257,"01:11:00,882","01:11:03,508",...as to how my clients felt on Sept. 6th?
tt0104257,"01:11:03,927","01:11:05,510",Sustained.
tt0104257,"01:11:07,388","01:11:11,350",Did Lieutenant Kendrick leave a standing order at that meeting?
tt0104257,"01:11:11,517","01:11:13,769",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:11:15,897","01:11:19,316",It was clear he didn't want us taking matters into our own hands.
tt0104257,"01:11:19,484","01:11:26,198",-What was the order? -Santiago wasn't to be touched.
tt0104257,"01:11:27,617","01:11:30,452",Your witness.
tt0104257,"01:11:30,620","01:11:34,373",Were you in Dawson and Downey's room five minutes later?
tt0104257,"01:11:34,540","01:11:35,874","No, sir."
tt0104257,"01:11:36,250","01:11:40,879",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:11:44,842","01:11:47,260",Government calls Corporal Raymond Thomas.
tt0104257,"01:11:47,428","01:11:52,933",Captain Ross is planning to call all the members of the platoon to testify.
tt0104257,"01:11:53,101","01:11:55,477",In light of the defense Kaffee is planning...
tt0104257,"01:11:55,645","01:11:59,314",...the platoon leader's instructions seems relevant testimony.
tt0104257,"01:11:59,482","01:12:04,069",The defense concedes that all 22 will confirm Hammaker's account...
tt0104257,"01:12:04,237","01:12:06,488",...if the government concedes none of them...
tt0104257,"01:12:06,656","01:12:10,409",...were in Dawson and Downey's room at 1620.
tt0104257,"01:12:10,576","01:12:14,913",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:12:15,081","01:12:19,001",Then we will adjourn. You can call your next witness tomorrow.
tt0104257,"01:12:19,168","01:12:20,919",All rise.
tt0104257,"01:12:32,598","01:12:35,308",-Let's go over the doctor again. -It's the right approach.
tt0104257,"01:12:35,560","01:12:37,352",We've been over this already.
tt0104257,"01:12:37,520","01:12:41,231","At 3:00, Stone says he doesn't know what killed Santiago."
tt0104257,"01:12:41,399","01:12:46,111","Then he meets with Jessep, and at 5:00 he says it was poison? He's lying."
tt0104257,"01:12:46,279","01:12:47,362",That's a relief.
tt0104257,"01:12:47,530","01:12:50,991","I was afraid I couldn't use the “liar, liar, pants on fire” defense."
tt0104257,"01:12:51,159","01:12:57,414",We can't prove coercion. Let's go over what we have.
tt0104257,"01:13:06,049","01:13:09,634",Private Santiago was admitted to the ER at 00:12...
tt0104257,"01:13:09,802","01:13:13,680",...and he was pronounced dead at 00:37.
tt0104257,"01:13:13,848","01:13:17,142","Dr. Stone, what is lactic acidosis?"
tt0104257,"01:13:17,310","01:13:20,896",If the muscles and other cells burn sugar instead of oxygen...
tt0104257,"01:13:21,064","01:13:22,564",...lactic acid is produced.
tt0104257,"01:13:22,732","01:13:26,151",That lactic acid is what caused Santiago's lungs to bleed.
tt0104257,"01:13:26,319","01:13:31,656",How long does it take before the muscles start burning sugar?
tt0104257,"01:13:32,533","01:13:38,121",-Twenty to 30 minutes. -What made it faster with Santiago?
tt0104257,"01:13:38,289","01:13:43,502",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:13:43,669","01:13:45,378",He is an expert medical witness.
tt0104257,"01:13:45,546","01:13:48,173","In this court, his opinion is not speculation."
tt0104257,"01:13:48,341","01:13:53,845",He is not a criminologist. The medical facts are inconclusive.
tt0104257,"01:13:54,013","01:13:57,682",A point I'm confident you'll illustrate on your cross-examination.
tt0104257,"01:13:57,850","01:14:00,852",So I'm sure you won't mind if his opinion is admitted now?
tt0104257,"01:14:01,437","01:14:03,522","Not at all, sir."
tt0104257,"01:14:05,066","01:14:11,154",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:14:11,322","01:14:15,325",You're aware that the lab and coroner's reports show no traces of poison?
tt0104257,"01:14:15,493","01:14:17,953","-Yes, I am. -Then how do you justify--?"
tt0104257,"01:14:18,121","01:14:23,583",There are literally dozens of toxins which are virtually undetectable.
tt0104257,"01:14:23,751","01:14:27,462",The nature of the acidosis is the compelling factor here.
tt0104257,"01:14:28,047","01:14:30,173","Thank you, sir."
tt0104257,"01:14:32,260","01:14:36,888","Commander, is it possible for a person to have an affliction, some condition..."
tt0104257,"01:14:37,056","01:14:39,891",...which might also speed up acidosis?
tt0104257,"01:14:42,728","01:14:46,481",-Is it possible? -It's possible.
tt0104257,"01:14:46,649","01:14:50,110",What might some of those conditions be?
tt0104257,"01:14:50,278","01:14:53,405",If a person had a coronary or cerebral disorder...
tt0104257,"01:14:53,573","01:14:55,657",...the process would be more rapid.
tt0104257,"01:14:55,825","01:14:57,909",If I had a coronary condition...
tt0104257,"01:14:58,077","01:15:01,663",...and a perfectly clean rag was placed in my mouth and pushed too far...
tt0104257,"01:15:01,831","01:15:04,749",...is it possible my cells would continue burning sugar...
tt0104257,"01:15:04,917","01:15:06,418",...after the rag was taken out?
tt0104257,"01:15:06,919","01:15:09,379",It would have to be a very serious condition.
tt0104257,"01:15:09,547","01:15:11,673",Is it possible to have a serious condition...
tt0104257,"01:15:11,841","01:15:13,800",...where initial symptoms were so mild...
tt0104257,"01:15:13,968","01:15:18,221",...as to escape a physician during a routine medical exam?
tt0104257,"01:15:18,389","01:15:21,099",Possibly. There would still be symptoms.
tt0104257,"01:15:21,267","01:15:22,601",What kind of symptoms?
tt0104257,"01:15:23,019","01:15:25,228",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:15:25,396","01:15:28,607",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:15:29,066","01:15:30,442",Of course.
tt0104257,"01:15:36,240","01:15:40,744",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:15:41,287","01:15:45,123",This is an order for Private Santiago to be put on restricted duty.
tt0104257,"01:15:45,291","01:15:49,127",Would you read your handwritten remarks at the bottom of the page?
tt0104257,"01:15:49,295","01:15:55,634","“Patient complains of chest pains, shortness of breath, and fatigue."
tt0104257,"01:15:55,801","01:16:00,138",Restricted from running distances over five miles for one week.”
tt0104257,"01:16:02,308","01:16:05,644",Isn't it possible Santiago had a serious coronary condition...
tt0104257,"01:16:05,811","01:16:08,313","...and it was that condition, not poison..."
tt0104257,"01:16:08,481","01:16:10,815",...that caused the rapid chemical reaction?
tt0104257,"01:16:10,983","01:16:14,152",-No. -It's not possible?
tt0104257,"01:16:14,654","01:16:19,157",No. I personally give each man a thorough physical examination.
tt0104257,"01:16:19,325","01:16:22,327",Private Santiago was given a clean bill of health.
tt0104257,"01:16:22,495","01:16:24,829","That's why it had to be poison, right?"
tt0104257,"01:16:24,997","01:16:27,791",Because if you gave a man with a serious condition...
tt0104257,"01:16:27,959","01:16:31,670",...a clean bill of health and he died from a heart-related incident...
tt0104257,"01:16:31,837","01:16:33,755",...you'd have a lot to answer for.
tt0104257,"01:16:33,923","01:16:36,800",-Object! Move to strike! -Sustained.
tt0104257,"01:16:38,052","01:16:41,179","I have no more questions, Your Honor."
tt0104257,"01:16:41,347","01:16:44,683",You've held a license to practice medicine for 17 years.

tt0104257,"01:29:53,138","01:29:56,974",Thanks. And I wanna tell you I think the whole fucking bunch of you are insane.
tt0104257,"01:29:57,142","01:29:59,560",This code of honor makes me wanna beat someone!
tt0104257,"01:29:59,728","01:30:03,481",Don't you dare lump me in with Kendrick and Jessep.
tt0104257,"01:30:03,648","01:30:08,611","I'm your friend. Your clients don't belong in jail, but it's not my decision."
tt0104257,"01:30:08,779","01:30:13,157",I represent the U.S. government without passion or prejudice...
tt0104257,"01:30:13,325","01:30:16,243",-...and my client has a case. -Here you go.
tt0104257,"01:30:20,290","01:30:23,542",I want you to acknowledge that the judge advocate has made you aware...
tt0104257,"01:30:23,710","01:30:28,255",...of the consequences of accusing a Marine officer without evidence.
tt0104257,"01:30:29,091","01:30:30,966",I've been so advised.
tt0104257,"01:30:35,222","01:30:42,103",You got bullied into that courtroom. By everyone. By Dawson. By Galloway.
tt0104257,"01:30:42,270","01:30:44,522","Shit, I practically dared you."
tt0104257,"01:30:45,941","01:30:51,278",You got bullied into that courtroom by the memory of a dead lawyer.
tt0104257,"01:30:55,450","01:31:00,454","You're a lousy fucking softball player, Jack!"
tt0104257,"01:31:01,957","01:31:07,503","Your boys are going down, Danny. I can't stop it anymore."
tt0104257,"01:31:11,466","01:31:16,846",-Was Santiago a good Marine? -I'd say he was average.
tt0104257,"01:31:17,013","01:31:23,936",Your proficiency and conduct reports all indicate he was below average.
tt0104257,"01:31:27,524","01:31:31,277","Yes, he was below average."
tt0104257,"01:31:31,444","01:31:34,238",I did not see the need to trample on his grave.
tt0104257,"01:31:35,407","01:31:37,408","We appreciate it, but you're under oath."
tt0104257,"01:31:37,576","01:31:40,161",I think we'd all like to hear the truth.
tt0104257,"01:31:40,328","01:31:42,079",I'm aware of my oath.
tt0104257,"01:31:42,247","01:31:44,999",These are the last three pro-con reports you signed...
tt0104257,"01:31:45,167","01:31:47,293",...for Lance Corporal Dawson.
tt0104257,"01:31:47,460","01:31:53,549","He rated exceptional twice, but on June 9th he's below average."
tt0104257,"01:31:53,717","01:31:57,595",-I'd like to discuss that. -That would be fine.
tt0104257,"01:31:57,762","01:32:01,348",Dawson's ranking after the School of Infantry was perfect.
tt0104257,"01:32:01,516","01:32:06,729","But unlike most of his class, he hasn't been promoted."
tt0104257,"01:32:06,897","01:32:11,775",-Was this report the reason? -I'm sure it was.
tt0104257,"01:32:11,943","01:32:16,238",-Do you recall why he got this grade? -I'm sure I don't.
tt0104257,"01:32:16,406","01:32:20,117",I have many men in my charge. I write many reports.
tt0104257,"01:32:20,285","01:32:25,956",Do you recall an incident involving a PFC Curtis Bell...
tt0104257,"01:32:26,124","01:32:28,751",...stealing liquor from the officers' club?
tt0104257,"01:32:29,044","01:32:30,753","Yes, I do."
tt0104257,"01:32:30,921","01:32:35,049",Did you report Private Bell to the proper authorities?
tt0104257,"01:32:35,217","01:32:37,259",I have two books at my bedside:
tt0104257,"01:32:37,427","01:32:40,221",the Marine Code and the King James Bible.
tt0104257,"01:32:40,388","01:32:45,851",The only proper authorities I'm aware of are Colonel Jessep and God.
tt0104257,"01:32:47,395","01:32:52,733",Then you don't recognize this court as a proper authority?
tt0104257,"01:32:52,901","01:32:57,780",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:32:57,948","01:33:03,744",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:33:03,912","01:33:06,664",I didn't want his record tarnished by a charge.
tt0104257,"01:33:07,749","01:33:10,668",You preferred it be handled in the unit?
tt0104257,"01:33:12,462","01:33:14,338","Yes, I most certainly did."
tt0104257,"01:33:15,382","01:33:18,801",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:33:18,969","01:33:22,096",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:33:22,264","01:33:28,519",Did you order that Private Bell receive no food or drink except water...
tt0104257,"01:33:28,687","01:33:30,771",...for a period of seven days?
tt0104257,"01:33:30,939","01:33:35,526",You're distorting the truth. He was on barracks restriction.
tt0104257,"01:33:35,694","01:33:42,658",He was given water and vitamins. His health was never in danger.
tt0104257,"01:33:42,867","01:33:48,205",I'm sure it was lovely for him. But you did order the restriction.
tt0104257,"01:33:48,373","01:33:52,459",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:33:52,627","01:33:59,049",-Wouldn't this be called a Code Red? -No.
tt0104257,"01:33:59,217","01:34:02,845",Would the other 478 Marines at Guantánamo...
tt0104257,"01:34:03,013","01:34:04,555",...consider it a Code Red?
tt0104257,"01:34:04,723","01:34:09,184",The witness can't testify as to what 478 other men would say.
tt0104257,"01:34:09,352","01:34:15,566","These questions are argumentative, and irrelevant badgering of the witness."
tt0104257,"01:34:15,734","01:34:19,403",Sustained. And I would remind you...
tt0104257,"01:34:19,571","01:34:23,574",...that you're questioning an officer with an impeccable service record.
tt0104257,"01:34:23,742","01:34:25,326","Thank you, Your Honor."
tt0104257,"01:34:26,202","01:34:32,916",Was Dawson rated below average for sneaking food to Private Bell?
tt0104257,"01:34:33,084","01:34:36,420",-Object! -Not so fast. Lieutenant?
tt0104257,"01:34:38,089","01:34:45,220",Dawson was given a below average rating for committing a crime.
tt0104257,"01:34:45,388","01:34:49,558",Crime? What crime did he commit?
tt0104257,"01:34:50,352","01:34:56,523","Lieutenant Kendrick, Dawson brought a hungry guy some food."
tt0104257,"01:34:56,691","01:35:01,779",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:35:01,946","01:35:07,493",And because he made a decision about the welfare of a Marine...
tt0104257,"01:35:07,660","01:35:11,121","...that conflicted with your order, he was punished, right?"
tt0104257,"01:35:11,289","01:35:14,750",Lance Corporal Dawson disobeyed an order!
tt0104257,"01:35:14,918","01:35:19,671","It wasn't a real order, was it? After all, it's peacetime."
tt0104257,"01:35:19,839","01:35:22,966",He wasn't asked to advance on a beachhead.
tt0104257,"01:35:23,134","01:35:27,471",Surely a Marine of Dawson's intelligence...
tt0104257,"01:35:27,639","01:35:30,474",...can be trusted to distinguish important orders...
tt0104257,"01:35:30,642","01:35:34,603",...from those that might be morally questionable?
tt0104257,"01:35:35,980","01:35:39,775",Lieutenant Kendrick? Can he?
tt0104257,"01:35:39,943","01:35:43,404",Can Dawson determine on his own which orders to follow?
tt0104257,"01:35:43,571","01:35:45,155","No, he cannot."
tt0104257,"01:35:45,323","01:35:47,950",A lesson he learned after the Bell incident.
tt0104257,"01:35:48,118","01:35:50,452","-I would think so. -You know so, don't you?"
tt0104257,"01:35:50,662","01:35:52,663",-Object! -Sustained.
tt0104257,"01:35:55,166","01:35:57,876","Lieutenant Kendrick, one final question."
tt0104257,"01:35:58,878","01:36:02,256",If you had ordered Dawson to give Santiago a Code Red...
tt0104257,"01:36:02,424","01:36:06,510",-I ordered them not to touch him! -...would he dare disobey you again?
tt0104257,"01:36:06,678","01:36:10,681","-Lieutenant, don't answer that! -You don't have to. I'm through."
tt0104257,"01:36:11,141","01:36:18,856",Did you order Dawson and Downey to give Willy Santiago a Code Red?
tt0104257,"01:36:20,275","01:36:24,611","-Lieutenant Kendrick, did you--? -No, I did not."
tt0104257,"01:36:28,533","01:36:31,410",-What's the word? -Well...
tt0104257,"01:36:31,578","01:36:35,038",...I got the tower chief's log. Jessep's telling the truth.
tt0104257,"01:36:35,206","01:36:38,375",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:36:49,512","01:36:54,141",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:36:56,978","01:37:00,606",There was no flight at 11:00! What the fuck are you trying to pull?!
tt0104257,"01:37:00,773","01:37:07,779",The first flight left at 23:00. It arrived at Andrews at 2 a.m.
tt0104257,"01:37:07,947","01:37:11,074",Really? Then why isn't it listed in the tower chief's log?
tt0104257,"01:37:13,077","01:37:18,916",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:37:19,083","01:37:22,669","Maybe he can make it so it didn't take off, but I can prove it landed."
tt0104257,"01:37:22,837","01:37:25,297",I'll get the logbook from Andrews.
tt0104257,"01:37:25,465","01:37:30,260",-You won't find anything. -He can make a flight disappear?
tt0104257,"01:37:30,887","01:37:32,804",Nathan Jessep is about to be appointed...
tt0104257,"01:37:32,972","01:37:34,932",...to the National Security Council.
tt0104257,"01:37:35,099","01:37:38,894",You don't get there without knowing how to sidestep a few landmines.
tt0104257,"01:37:39,062","01:37:41,480",He won't be able to sidestep you.
tt0104257,"01:37:42,023","01:37:44,274",You still intend to put me on the stand?
tt0104257,"01:37:44,442","01:37:47,277",Thursday morning. Ten o'clock.
tt0104257,"01:37:51,866","01:37:55,619",There's gotta be someone who can testify to the flight.
tt0104257,"01:37:55,787","01:38:01,917",This isn't TWA. You know how many planes take off and land every day?
tt0104257,"01:38:02,085","01:38:04,920",The ground crew isn't gonna remember it.
tt0104257,"01:38:05,088","01:38:06,255","Well, how do you know--"
tt0104257,"01:38:06,506","01:38:08,674",Forget the flight. Forget the flight.
tt0104257,"01:38:08,925","01:38:13,679",Markinson will testify that the transfer was forged.
tt0104257,"01:38:13,846","01:38:17,599",That and Downey's testimony really ought to be enough.
tt0104257,"01:38:23,356","01:38:27,317",Why did you go into Santiago's room on the night of the 6th?
tt0104257,"01:38:27,485","01:38:32,656",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:38:33,241","01:38:37,828",I was ordered to by the platoon commander...
tt0104257,"01:38:37,996","01:38:40,455",...Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick.
tt0104257,"01:38:41,624","01:38:43,667",You're gonna do fine.
tt0104257,"01:38:45,837","01:38:51,508",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:38:54,804","01:39:00,225",Remember the order of the questions? Are you sure? And use small words.
tt0104257,"01:39:00,393","01:39:02,185",-Just go slow. -I'm gonna go slow.
tt0104257,"01:39:02,437","01:39:06,148",Okay. And get him off as fast as you can.
tt0104257,"01:39:06,399","01:39:08,775",What? It's gonna be fine.
tt0104257,"01:39:11,571","01:39:17,367","Dear Mr. and Mrs. Santiago, l was William's executive officer."
tt0104257,"01:39:17,535","01:39:20,871","I knew your son vaguely, which is to say I knew his name."
tt0104257,"01:39:21,873","01:39:26,793","Soon, the trial of the two men charged with his death will be concluded..."
tt0104257,"01:39:26,961","01:39:33,342",...and the jury will try to offer you an explanation as to why he's dead.
tt0104257,"01:39:33,509","01:39:37,346","For my part, I've done as much as I can to bring the truth to light."
tt0104257,"01:39:37,513","01:39:39,222",And the truth is this:
tt0104257,"01:39:39,390","01:39:41,892",Your son is dead for only one reason...
tt0104257,"01:39:42,268","01:39:44,895",...I wasn't strong enough to stop it.
tt0104257,"01:39:45,063","01:39:49,024","Always, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Andrew Markinson..."
tt0104257,"01:39:49,192","01:39:50,901",...United States Marine Corps.
tt0104257,"01:39:56,199","01:39:59,826","Private, I want you to tell us one last time:"
tt0104257,"01:39:59,994","01:40:05,916",Why did you go to Santiago's room on the night of September 6th?
tt0104257,"01:40:06,084","01:40:10,379",A Code Red was ordered by Platoon Commander Kendrick.
tt0104257,"01:40:10,546","01:40:14,424",Thank you. Your witness.
tt0104257,"01:40:18,930","01:40:22,015","The week of 2 September, the switch log..."
tt0104257,"01:40:22,183","01:40:25,936",...has you down at Post 39 until 16:00. Right?
tt0104257,"01:40:26,104","01:40:32,609",-They keep that log pretty good. -How far is Post 39 from barracks?
tt0104257,"01:40:32,777","01:40:38,990","-It's a ways, sir. It's a hike. -About how far by jeep?"
tt0104257,"01:40:40,576","01:40:42,536","About 10, 15 minutes, sir."
tt0104257,"01:40:42,704","01:40:46,623",#NAME?
tt0104257,"01:40:46,791","01:40:51,712",The pickup private-- That's what we call the guy that drops us off.
tt0104257,"01:40:51,879","01:40:55,841",Also because he can get the girls in New York City.
tt0104257,"01:40:56,008","01:41:03,056","--he got a flat tire at Post 39, so we had to jog back to barracks."
tt0104257,"01:41:03,224","01:41:09,938","And if it's 10 or 15 minutes by jeep, it must be an hour by foot, right?"
tt0104257,"01:41:10,106","01:41:16,027","-We did it in 45 flat, sir. -Not bad."
tt0104257,"01:41:16,195","01:41:22,617",You've said your assault on Santiago was ordered by Lieutenant Kendrick...

tt0104257,"01:41:27,790","01:41:28,957","Yes, sir."
tt0104257,"01:41:29,125","01:41:34,171",You said you weren't back before 16:45.

tt0104257,"01:41:42,764","01:41:45,849","Well, you see, sir, there was a blow-out...."
tt0104257,"01:41:46,017","01:41:47,851",Did you ever actually hear...
tt0104257,"01:41:48,019","01:41:49,853",...Lieutenant Kendrick order a Code Red?
tt0104257,"01:41:50,021","01:41:52,189","Well, Hal said that--"
tt0104257,"01:41:52,356","01:41:54,274",Did you ever actually hear...

tt0104257,"01:41:58,070","01:42:02,157","-No, sir. -I'd like to request a recess."
tt0104257,"01:42:02,325","01:42:06,369",-The witness has rights! -He has been read his rights.
tt0104257,"01:42:06,537","01:42:07,954",The question will be repeated.
tt0104257,"01:42:08,206","01:42:13,460",Why did you go to Santiago's room? Did Dawson tell you to?
tt0104257,"01:42:13,628","01:42:17,214",-Don't look at him! -Answer the captain's question.
tt0104257,"01:42:20,551","01:42:25,722",Yes. I was given an order by Lance Corporal Dawson...
tt0104257,"01:42:25,890","01:42:27,641",...and I followed it.

tt0104257,"01:43:15,356","01:43:18,108",...or call Downey back before we get to Dawson.

tt0104257,"01:58:09,833","01:58:12,501","Lieutenant, state your question."
tt0104257,"01:58:13,003","01:58:15,796",I'm wondering why Santiago wasn't packed.
tt0104257,"01:58:18,383","01:58:21,469","Tell you what, we'll get back to that one in a minute."
tt0104257,"01:58:21,636","01:58:25,473",This is a record of all phone calls from your base in the past 24 hours.
tt0104257,"01:58:25,640","01:58:28,893","After being subpoenaed, you made three calls."
tt0104257,"01:58:29,060","01:58:31,520",Do you recognize those numbers?
tt0104257,"01:58:31,688","01:58:37,443",I called Colonel Fitzhughes to let him know I'd be in town.
tt0104257,"01:58:37,611","01:58:43,282",The second was to arrange a meeting with Congressman Richman.

tt0104257,"01:58:52,209","01:58:53,542",I'll put a stop to this.
tt0104257,"01:58:53,710","01:58:57,463",These are the phone records from Gitmo for September 6th.
tt0104257,"01:58:57,631","01:59:02,927",And these are 14 letters that Santiago wrote in nine months...
tt0104257,"01:59:03,094","01:59:06,347","...requesting, begging for a transfer."
tt0104257,"01:59:06,515","01:59:09,308",Upon hearing the news he was getting it...
tt0104257,"01:59:09,476","01:59:11,268",...Santiago was so excited...
tt0104257,"01:59:11,436","01:59:15,689",...you know how many people he called? Zero! Nobody.
tt0104257,"01:59:16,107","01:59:19,568","Not one call to his parents, saying he was coming home."
tt0104257,"01:59:19,736","01:59:23,197","Not one call to a friend, saying, “Can you pick me up?”"
tt0104257,"01:59:23,365","01:59:29,411","He was asleep at midnight, and you say he had a flight in six hours."
tt0104257,"01:59:29,579","01:59:35,918",Yet everything he owned was in his closet or his footlocker.
tt0104257,"01:59:36,086","01:59:39,588","You were leaving for one day, you packed and made three calls."
tt0104257,"01:59:39,756","01:59:45,970",Santiago was leaving for the rest of his life...
tt0104257,"01:59:46,137","01:59:50,975","...and he hadn't called a soul, and he hadn't packed a thing."
tt0104257,"01:59:54,688","01:59:56,272",Can you explain that?
tt0104257,"01:59:59,150","02:00:03,863","Fact is, there was no transfer order. Santiago wasn't going anywhere, right?"
tt0104257,"02:00:04,030","02:00:09,785",Objection! Lieutenant Kaffee is trying to smear a high-ranking Marine officer...
tt0104257,"02:00:09,953","02:00:12,288",...desperately hoping to suggest impropriety...
tt0104257,"02:00:12,455","02:00:14,331",...and win points with the court.
tt0104257,"02:00:14,499","02:00:17,585",I recommend that he be reprimanded...
tt0104257,"02:00:17,752","02:00:21,589",...and the witness be excused with apologies.
tt0104257,"02:00:22,173","02:00:28,596",#NAME?
tt0104257,"02:00:32,684","02:00:37,146","-Is this funny, sir? -No, it's not. It's tragic."
tt0104257,"02:00:37,314","02:00:44,153",-Do you have an answer? -Absolutely. I don't have a damn clue.
tt0104257,"02:00:44,321","02:00:50,659",Maybe he was an early riser. Maybe he didn't have any friends.
tt0104257,"02:00:50,827","02:00:54,246","I'm an educated man, but I can't speak intelligently..."
tt0104257,"02:00:54,414","02:00:58,000",...about the travel habits of William Santiago.
tt0104257,"02:00:58,168","02:01:02,963",What I do know is that he was set to leave the base at 06:00.
tt0104257,"02:01:03,798","02:01:08,719","Now, are these really the questions that I was called here to answer?"
tt0104257,"02:01:08,887","02:01:11,347",Phone calls and foot lockers?
tt0104257,"02:01:11,806","02:01:15,142","Please tell me you have something more, lieutenant."
tt0104257,"02:01:15,352","02:01:18,938",These two Marines are on trial for their lives.
tt0104257,"02:01:19,105","02:01:25,861",Please tell me their lawyer hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone bill.
tt0104257,"02:01:26,279","02:01:29,365","Do you have any other questions for me, counselor?"
tt0104257,"02:01:38,249","02:01:40,876",Lieutenant Kaffee?
tt0104257,"02:01:48,218","02:01:52,554","Lieutenant, do you have anything further for this witness?"
tt0104257,"02:01:59,354","02:02:04,149","-Thanks, Danny. I love Washington. -Excuse me. I didn't dismiss you."
tt0104257,"02:02:05,151","02:02:09,780",I beg your pardon? -I'm not through with my examination.
tt0104257,"02:02:09,948","02:02:11,573",Sit down.
tt0104257,"02:02:13,410","02:02:15,911",-“Colonel.” -What's that?
tt0104257,"02:02:16,079","02:02:20,416",I'd appreciate if he would address me as “colonel” or “sir.” I've earned it.
tt0104257,"02:02:21,001","02:02:24,545",Defense counsel will address him “colonel” or “sir”.
tt0104257,"02:02:24,713","02:02:27,756",I don't know what the hell kind of unit you're running here.
tt0104257,"02:02:27,924","02:02:31,510",And the witness will address me as “judge” or “Your Honor.”
tt0104257,"02:02:31,678","02:02:33,512",I'm quite certain I've earned it.
tt0104257,"02:02:34,264","02:02:38,225","Take your seat, colonel."
tt0104257,"02:02:41,396","02:02:45,566",What shall we discuss now? My favorite color?
tt0104257,"02:02:46,568","02:02:49,194","Colonel, the 6 a.m. flight was the first off the base?"
tt0104257,"02:02:49,362","02:02:50,946",Yes.
tt0104257,"02:02:51,114","02:02:55,200",There wasn't one seven hours earlier and landed at Andrews at 2 a.m.?
tt0104257,"02:02:55,368","02:02:58,245","I think we've covered this, haven't we?"
tt0104257,"02:02:59,080","02:03:04,293",These are the tower chief's logs for Guantánamo Bay and Andrews.
tt0104257,"02:03:04,794","02:03:10,299","There's no flight at 11 p.m., and no arrival at 2 a.m."
tt0104257,"02:03:10,467","02:03:13,802",I'd like to admit them as Defense Exhibits Alpha and Bravo.
tt0104257,"02:03:13,970","02:03:17,389",You're admitting evidence of a flight that never existed.
tt0104257,"02:03:17,557","02:03:19,975","We believe it did, sir."
tt0104257,"02:03:20,143","02:03:26,148",We call Airmen O'Malley and Rodriguez of Andrews Air Base.
tt0104257,"02:03:26,316","02:03:33,739",-They weren't on the list. -They are rebuttal witnesses.
tt0104257,"02:03:33,907","02:03:36,742",-I'll allow the witnesses. -This is ridiculous!
tt0104257,"02:03:37,077","02:03:38,410","Colonel, a moment ago--"
tt0104257,"02:03:38,578","02:03:44,333","-Check the logs, for chrissake! -We'll get to that in a minute."
tt0104257,"02:03:45,418","02:03:51,465",You said you ordered Kendrick to say that Santiago wasn't to be touched.
tt0104257,"02:03:51,633","02:03:53,092",That's right.

tt0104257,"02:04:06,356","02:04:10,359","Any chance he could have thought, “The old man is wrong”?"
tt0104257,"02:04:10,985","02:04:12,361",No.
tt0104257,"02:04:12,529","02:04:18,033","When Lt. Kendrick talked to the men, any chance they ignored him?"

tt0104257,"02:04:34,551","02:04:39,096","We follow orders, son. We follow orders or people die."
tt0104257,"02:04:39,264","02:04:42,391",It's that simple. Are we clear?
tt0104257,"02:04:43,101","02:04:44,351","Yes, sir."
tt0104257,"02:04:44,519","02:04:48,897",#NAME?
tt0104257,"02:04:50,608","02:04:54,820","Just one more question, before I call Airmen O'Malley and Rodriguez."
tt0104257,"02:04:56,114","02:05:00,409",If you ordered that Santiago wasn't to be touched...
tt0104257,"02:05:00,910","02:05:04,705",...and your orders are always followed...
tt0104257,"02:05:04,873","02:05:09,084",...then why would Santiago be in danger?
tt0104257,"02:05:10,044","02:05:13,755",Why would it be necessary to transfer him off the base?
tt0104257,"02:05:19,554","02:05:23,849",Santiago was a substandard Marine. He was being transferred--
tt0104257,"02:05:24,017","02:05:27,978",You said he was being transferred because he was in grave danger.
tt0104257,"02:05:28,146","02:05:30,272",-That's correct. -You said he was in danger.
tt0104257,"02:05:30,440","02:05:32,608","-I said, “grave danger?” You said-- -I recall--"
tt0104257,"02:05:32,775","02:05:34,276",I can have the reporter read--
tt0104257,"02:05:34,444","02:05:37,362",I know what I said! I don't have to have it read back--
tt0104257,"02:05:37,530","02:05:41,033",Then why the two orders? Colonel?
tt0104257,"02:05:43,161","02:05:45,621",Sometimes men take matters into their own hands.
tt0104257,"02:05:45,788","02:05:48,707","No, sir. You made it clear your men never do."
tt0104257,"02:05:48,875","02:05:53,587","Your men follow orders or people die. So Santiago wasn't in danger, right?"
tt0104257,"02:05:53,755","02:05:55,881",You snotty little bastard.
tt0104257,"02:05:56,049","02:05:59,259","-Your Honor, I ask for a recess. -I'd like an answer."
tt0104257,"02:05:59,427","02:06:01,220",The court will wait for an answer.
tt0104257,"02:06:02,055","02:06:07,851",If Lt. Kendrick gave an order that Santiago wasn't to be touched...
tt0104257,"02:06:08,019","02:06:12,272",...why did he have to be transferred? Colonel?
tt0104257,"02:06:12,440","02:06:16,193",Kendrick ordered a Code Red because that's what you told him to do!
tt0104257,"02:06:16,361","02:06:17,486",Object!
tt0104257,"02:06:17,654","02:06:23,867","And when it went bad, you signed a phony transfer and doctored the logs!"
tt0104257,"02:06:24,035","02:06:25,702",You coerced the doctor!
tt0104257,"02:06:25,870","02:06:28,997","Colonel Jessep, did you order the Code Red?"
tt0104257,"02:06:29,165","02:06:32,417",-You don't have to answer that. -I'll answer the question.
tt0104257,"02:06:32,585","02:06:34,836",-You want answers? -I think I'm entitled!
tt0104257,"02:06:35,004","02:06:37,256",-You want answers? -I want the truth!
tt0104257,"02:06:37,423","02:06:40,550",You can't handle the truth!
tt0104257,"02:06:40,718","02:06:45,013","Son, we live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded."
tt0104257,"02:06:45,181","02:06:49,685","Who's gonna do it? You? You, Lieutenant Weinberg?"
tt0104257,"02:06:49,852","02:06:53,689",I have a greater responsibility than you can possible fathom.
tt0104257,"02:06:53,856","02:06:57,192",You weep for Santiago and you curse the Marines.
tt0104257,"02:06:57,360","02:07:01,196",You have that luxury. The luxury of not knowing what I know:
tt0104257,"02:07:01,364","02:07:05,325","That Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives."
tt0104257,"02:07:05,493","02:07:11,290","And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives!"
tt0104257,"02:07:11,457","02:07:13,417",You don't want the truth because deep down...
tt0104257,"02:07:13,584","02:07:15,711",...in places you don't talk about at parties...
tt0104257,"02:07:15,878","02:07:20,590",...you want me on that wall. You need me on that wall.
tt0104257,"02:07:20,758","02:07:25,262","We use words like honor, code, loyalty."
tt0104257,"02:07:25,430","02:07:28,849",We use them as the backbone of a life spent defending something.
tt0104257,"02:07:29,017","02:07:31,059",You use them as a punchline!
tt0104257,"02:07:31,227","02:07:34,980",I have neither the time nor inclination to explain myself...
tt0104257,"02:07:35,148","02:07:39,609",...to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the freedom I provide...
tt0104257,"02:07:39,777","02:07:42,154",...then questions the manner in which I provide it!
tt0104257,"02:07:42,322","02:07:45,365",I would rather you just said “thank you” and went on your way.
tt0104257,"02:07:45,533","02:07:49,286","Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post."
tt0104257,"02:07:49,454","02:07:54,249","Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you are entitled to!"
tt0104257,"02:07:54,417","02:07:56,918",-Did you order the Code Red? -I did the job--
tt0104257,"02:07:57,086","02:08:00,422",-Did you order the Code Red? -You're goddamn right I did!
tt0104257,"02:08:11,476","02:08:14,311",I suggest the members be dismissed...
tt0104257,"02:08:14,479","02:08:17,898",...so we can move to an article 39A session.

tt0104257,"02:13:39,553","02:13:44,891","O'Malley and Rodriguez, what exactly could they testify to?"

tt1431045,"00:13:43,700","00:13:45,611","Anyhow, technically, this is a murder."
tt1431045,"00:13:45,620","00:13:48,313",But some of the best love stories start with a murder.
tt1431045,"00:13:48,506","00:13:52,559","And that's exactly what this is: a love story. And to tell it right,"
tt1431045,"00:13:52,660","00:13:57,515",I gotta take you back to long before I squeeze this ass into red spandex.

tt1431045,"00:37:34,003","00:37:36,907","- You big, chrome cockgobbler! - That's not nice."
tt1431045,"00:37:37,006","00:37:39,910",You really got to fuck this up for me? Trust me...
tt1431045,"00:37:40,009","00:37:45,916",That wheezing bag of dick-tits has it coming! He's pure evil!
tt1431045,"00:37:46,015","00:37:49,920","Besides, nobody's getting hurt."
tt1431045,"00:37:54,925","00:37:57,627",That guy was already up there when I got here.
tt1431045,"00:37:57,627","00:38:00,047","Wade, you are better than this."
tt1431045,"00:38:00,056","00:38:03,267","Join us, use your powers for good."
tt1431045,"00:38:03,283","00:38:05,098",- Heads up! - Be a superhero.
tt1431045,"00:38:05,107","00:38:09,347","- Listen! The day I decide to be a crime-fighting shit-swizzler,"
tt1431045,"00:38:09,440","00:38:11,467","who rooms with a bunch of other little whiners,"
tt1431045,"00:38:11,476","00:38:13,493","at the Neverland Mansion of some creepy,"
tt1431045,"00:38:13,502","00:38:17,171","old, bald, heaven's gate looking motherfucker,"
tt1431045,"00:38:17,248","00:38:18,347","on that day!,"
tt1431045,"00:38:18,356","00:38:21,348","I'll send your shiny, happy ass a friend request."
tt1431045,"00:38:21,348","00:38:24,062","But until then, I'm gonna do what I came here to do."
tt1431045,"00:38:24,153","00:38:26,754","Either that, or slap the bitch out of you!"
tt1431045,"00:38:26,763","00:38:28,077",#NAME?
tt1431045,"00:38:28,086","00:38:30,168","- Zip it, Sinead! - Hey, Douchepool!"
tt1431045,"00:38:30,761","00:38:32,963",And I hope you're watching...
tt1431045,"00:38:35,966","00:38:37,968",Quite unfortunate.
tt1431045,"00:38:40,971","00:38:43,974",That does it!
tt1431045,"00:38:46,977","00:38:48,979",Canada!
tt1431045,"00:38:50,481","00:38:53,984","- That's not good. Cock shot! - Wade, please."
tt1431045,"00:38:54,985","00:38:57,988","Oh, your poor wife!"
tt1431045,"00:38:58,087","00:38:59,990",You really should stop.
tt1431045,"00:39:02,293","00:39:05,396",All the dinosaurs feared the T-Rex.
tt1431045,"00:39:08,999","00:39:11,552","I promise this gets worse for you, big boy!"
tt1431045,"00:39:11,561","00:39:13,010",This is embarassing.
tt1431045,"00:39:14,004","00:39:16,006",Please. Stay down.
tt1431045,"00:39:17,007","00:39:19,709",Did you ever hear of the one-legged man in the ass-kicking contest?
tt1431045,"00:39:19,810","00:39:20,906",Do you have 'off' switch?
tt1431045,"00:39:20,915","00:39:23,822","Yeah, it's right next to the prostate. Or is that the 'on' switch?"
tt1431045,"00:39:24,014","00:39:25,316",Enough!
tt1431045,"00:39:34,024","00:39:36,026",Let us go talk to the Professor.
tt1431045,"00:39:37,027","00:39:41,631",McAvoy or Stewart? These timelines are so confusing...
tt1431045,"00:39:42,032","00:39:47,438","- Dead or alive, you're coming with me! - You will recover, Wade. You always do."
tt1431045,"00:39:53,043","00:39:56,046","Did you ever see ""127 Hours""? Spoiler alert!"
tt1431045,"00:40:00,050","00:40:03,053",Oh my God. Nasty.
tt1431045,"00:40:05,055","00:40:11,061","Oh, there's the money shot, baby. Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret."
tt1431045,"00:40:21,071","00:40:23,474","Rock, meet bottom."
tt1431045,"00:40:24,074","00:40:26,975","When life ends up breathtakingly fucked,"
tt1431045,"00:40:26,984","00:40:31,088","you can generally trace it back to one big, bad decision."
tt1431045,"00:40:31,180","00:40:34,084",The one that sent you down the road to Shitsburg.
tt1431045,"00:40:34,183","00:40:37,087","This, well, this was mine."
tt1431045,"00:40:38,088","00:40:44,094",Mr. Wilson. Nothing warms my heart more than a change of someone else's.
tt1431045,"00:40:45,095","00:40:48,098",You've finally hit fuck-it.
tt1431045,"00:40:48,197","00:40:50,778",Just promise you'll do right by me.
tt1431045,"00:40:50,787","00:40:53,212",So I can do right by someone else.
tt1431045,"00:40:53,221","00:40:54,420",Of course.
tt1431045,"00:40:55,105","00:41:00,110",And please don't make the super-suit green. Or animated!
tt1431045,"00:41:20,130","00:41:25,135",This place seems sanitary. My first request is warmer hands.
tt1431045,"00:41:25,235","00:41:29,139",And Jesus! A warmer table.
tt1431045,"00:41:30,140","00:41:33,276","You should really come up with a safe word, fellas."
tt1431045,"00:41:33,285","00:41:35,152",I'm thinking 'pork and beans'.
tt1431045,"00:41:37,622","00:41:39,624",Easy!
tt1431045,"00:41:42,227","00:41:44,070",Aren't you a little strong for a lady?
tt1431045,"00:41:45,048","00:41:48,051",I'm calling Wang.
tt1431045,"00:41:50,053","00:41:55,058",What's up with the matches? Oral fixation? Or just a big Stallone fan?
tt1431045,"00:41:56,059","00:41:58,475","Patience, Angel. All in good time."
tt1431045,"00:41:58,484","00:42:02,072",Are you here for the turn down service or what?
tt1431045,"00:42:03,333","00:42:04,387",We have another talker.
tt1431045,"00:42:04,396","00:42:06,923",I'm just excited about my first day at superhero camp.
tt1431045,"00:42:07,015","00:42:09,032",Shut the fuck up.
tt1431045,"00:42:12,075","00:42:17,080","Mr. Wilson, my name's Ajax. I manage this workshop."
tt1431045,"00:42:18,182","00:42:21,082","All of my welcome speeches used to be filled with euphemisms like,"
tt1431045,"00:42:21,084","00:42:25,088","""this may hurt a little,"" or ""this might cause you some discomfort."""
tt1431045,"00:42:25,189","00:42:26,631",But I'm going blunt.
tt1431045,"00:42:26,640","00:42:30,093",This workshop is not a government-led program.
tt1431045,"00:42:30,093","00:42:32,947",It's a private institution that turns reclamation projects
tt1431045,"00:42:32,956","00:42:34,406",like yourself into men of....
tt1431045,"00:42:35,098","00:42:38,101",Extraordinary abilities.
tt1431045,"00:42:39,102","00:42:43,106",But if you think superhuman powers are acquired painlessly...
tt1431045,"00:42:43,115","00:42:44,216",Wrong.
tt1431045,"00:42:44,608","00:42:46,109",I'm injecting you with a serum
tt1431045,"00:42:46,118","00:42:48,820",that activates any mutant genes lurking in your DNA.
tt1431045,"00:42:49,012","00:42:54,117","For it to work, we need to subject you to extreme stress."
tt1431045,"00:42:58,121","00:43:02,125","You've heard the whole, ""make an omelet, break some eggs"" bit, I hope."
tt1431045,"00:43:02,526","00:43:07,130","I'm about to hurt you, Wade. I was a patient here once myself, you know."
tt1431045,"00:43:08,131","00:43:13,136",The treatment affects everyone differently. It made Angel inhumanly strong.
tt1431045,"00:43:14,137","00:43:17,013","In my case, it enhanced my reflexes,"
tt1431045,"00:43:17,022","00:43:21,453",also scorched my nerve endings so I no longer feel pain.
tt1431045,"00:43:23,146","00:43:26,751","And in fact, I no longer feel anything."
tt1431045,"00:43:36,159","00:43:40,163",Thank... thank you! You have something in your teeth.
tt1431045,"00:43:41,164","00:43:46,169","Right in the middle there, just... Nugget of romaine lettuce or something."
tt1431045,"00:43:48,171","00:43:50,173",It's been bothering me for a long time.
tt1431045,"00:43:52,175","00:43:55,120","Made you look. Hey, is Ajax your actual name,"
tt1431045,"00:43:55,129","00:43:57,690",because it sounds suspiciously made up.
tt1431045,"00:43:57,782","00:44:05,390",What is it really? Kevin? Bruce? Scott? Mitch? Rickster? Is it Basil Fawlty?
tt1431045,"00:44:05,498","00:44:10,093",Joke away. One thing that never survives this place is a sense of humor.
tt1431045,"00:44:10,193","00:44:13,197",- We'll see about that. - I suppose we will.
tt1431045,"00:44:14,198","00:44:15,599",He's all yours.
tt1431045,"00:44:15,608","00:44:21,214",C'mon. You're gonna leave me all alone here with less angry Rosie O'Donnell?
tt1431045,"00:44:25,209","00:44:27,332",This is how it's going to work.
tt1431045,"00:44:27,341","00:44:30,663","Adrenaline acts as a catalyst for the serum, so"
tt1431045,"00:44:30,672","00:44:33,233",we're gonna have to make you suffer.
tt1431045,"00:44:34,218","00:44:38,729","If you're lucky, your mutant genes will activate and manifest in a"
tt1431045,"00:44:38,738","00:44:40,733",spectacular fashion.
tt1431045,"00:44:44,228","00:44:47,231","If not, well, we'll have to keep on hurting you."
tt1431045,"00:44:48,232","00:44:52,236","In new and different ways, each more painful than the last."
tt1431045,"00:44:54,238","00:44:57,241",Until you finally mutate...
tt1431045,"00:44:58,242","00:45:00,195",or die.
tt1431045,"00:45:06,250","00:45:08,137",You mean like a bucket list?
tt1431045,"00:45:08,146","00:45:13,266","Like a fuck it list, I'd like to light a spiff off the Olympic torch."
tt1431045,"00:45:13,358","00:45:15,860","Acid to me, right after."
tt1431045,"00:45:15,960","00:45:22,266",Let's not forget: naked tandem base-jumping with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs.
tt1431045,"00:45:22,367","00:45:25,269",Anything on my bucket list would involve public nudity.
tt1431045,"00:45:26,270","00:45:29,273","Finally, giving Meredith Baxter Birney a dutch oven."
tt1431045,"00:45:29,374","00:45:32,877","No, receiving a dutch oven from Meredith Baxter Birney."
tt1431045,"00:45:36,280","00:45:40,284",Making banana pancakes... For my kids...
tt1431045,"00:45:43,687","00:45:46,290",Vanessa...
tt1431045,"00:45:49,293","00:45:52,296",I wanna see Vanessa.
tt1431045,"00:45:52,397","00:45:56,300","Oh, lovely. I don't know about anyone else but, I'm touched."
tt1431045,"00:45:56,401","00:45:58,202",We're just joking.
tt1431045,"00:45:58,211","00:46:03,316","No, no. It's okay. I encourage distractions."
tt1431045,"00:46:03,408","00:46:06,308","Wouldn't want you giving up on us now, would we?"
tt1431045,"00:46:06,310","00:46:10,314","Hey, don't take any shit from him, Cunningham. How tough can he be..."
tt1431045,"00:46:11,315","00:46:15,319",- ... with a name like Francis? - Francis?
tt1431045,"00:46:16,320","00:46:21,325",It's his legal name. He got Ajax from a dish soap.
tt1431045,"00:46:23,327","00:46:28,332",F-R-A-N-C-I... oops!
tt1431045,"00:46:31,035","00:46:34,338",Snagged the dry cleaning tag off your lab coat.
tt1431045,"00:46:34,439","00:46:38,342","FYI, I can probably get you a superhero discount."
tt1431045,"00:46:38,443","00:46:42,346",#NAME?
tt1431045,"00:46:42,447","00:46:45,390",Why don't you do us all a favor and shut the fuck up?
tt1431045,"00:46:45,398","00:46:47,360",Or I'll sew your pretty mouth shut.
tt1431045,"00:46:47,452","00:46:51,255","Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you."
tt1431045,"00:46:51,355","00:46:54,474","See, here's the problem with round-the-clock torture,"
tt1431045,"00:46:54,483","00:46:57,370",it's that you can't really step it up from there.
tt1431045,"00:46:59,363","00:47:02,366",Is that what you think?
tt1431045,"00:47:07,371","00:47:12,076","If this doesn't unlock your mutation, then, well, nothing will."
tt1431045,"00:47:12,376","00:47:15,685",What we're gonna do is lower the oxygen concentration in the air
tt1431045,"00:47:15,694","00:47:18,391",to the exact point you feel like you're suffocating.
tt1431045,"00:47:18,483","00:47:22,556","If your brain wave's slow meaning you're about to pass out,"
tt1431045,"00:47:22,565","00:47:24,397",then we'll turn up the O2.
tt1431045,"00:47:24,489","00:47:28,059","If your heart rate slows meaning you're able to catch your breath,"
tt1431045,"00:47:28,068","00:47:29,402",we'll turn it back down.
tt1431045,"00:47:30,394","00:47:34,398",And that's where we'll leave you. Right there.
tt1431045,"00:47:35,399","00:47:39,403",#NAME?
tt1431045,"00:47:40,404","00:47:43,407",You still think we're making you a superhero.
tt1431045,"00:47:43,508","00:47:50,214",You? A dishonorable discharge? Hip deep in hookers?
tt1431045,"00:47:50,414","00:47:55,419","You're nothing. A little secret, Wade..."
tt1431045,"00:47:55,520","00:47:59,423","This workshop doesn't make superheroes, we make superslaves."
tt1431045,"00:48:00,424","00:48:05,429",We're gonna fit you with a control collar and auction you off to the highest bidder.
tt1431045,"00:48:05,530","00:48:07,639",And that's what they'll have you doing.
tt1431045,"00:48:07,648","00:48:10,443","Terrorizing citizens, putting down freedom fighters."
tt1431045,"00:48:12,436","00:48:15,439",Maybe just mow the occasional lawn.
tt1431045,"00:48:16,440","00:48:18,442",What the fuck is wrong with you?
tt1431045,"00:48:23,447","00:48:29,153",You're never going home after this. Now there's a brave face.
tt1431045,"00:48:29,453","00:48:32,456","Wait, wait, wait..."
tt1431045,"00:48:33,457","00:48:38,462","Seriously, you actually have something in your teeth now."
tt1431045,"00:48:39,463","00:48:45,469",#NAME?
tt1431045,"00:49:26,510","00:49:31,515",Did I say this was a love story? No. It's a horror movie.
tt1431045,"00:49:47,531","00:49:52,536",Fucking hell! Looks like someone lost a shot at homecoming king.
tt1431045,"00:49:52,637","00:49:54,055",What have you done to me?
tt1431045,"00:49:54,064","00:49:58,551",I've mainly raised your stress levels high enough to trigger a mutation.
tt1431045,"00:49:58,643","00:50:03,547","- You sadistic fuck! - I've cured you, Wade."
tt1431045,"00:50:03,648","00:50:06,499",Now your mutated cells can heal anything.
tt1431045,"00:50:06,508","00:50:09,562",Striking your cancer as fast as it can form.
tt1431045,"00:50:10,554","00:50:15,559","Yeah, I've seen some other side effects before... I could cure them."
tt1431045,"00:50:18,562","00:50:20,564",But where's the fun in that?
tt1431045,"00:50:22,566","00:50:25,569","Now I'm gonna shut you in again, Wade."
tt1431045,"00:50:27,061","00:50:30,574",Not because I need to.
tt1431045,"00:50:33,577","00:50:35,579",Because I want to.
tt1431045,"00:50:49,593","00:50:52,596",Farewell. Go ahead.
tt1431045,"00:50:54,598","00:50:57,601",Ugh. You smell like shit.
tt1431045,"00:51:00,604","00:51:04,608","- Motherfucker... - That's alright, it's alright..."
tt1431045,"00:51:04,709","00:51:11,615","I think we have earned that one. You take off. Go on, off you go."

tt0137523,"00:11:52,427","00:11:54,417",I couldn't sleep.

tt0137523,"00:12:27,369","00:12:29,722",And you're never really awake.
tt0137523,"00:12:30,847","00:12:33,235","To begin tonight's communion,"
tt0137523,"00:12:33,326","00:12:35,963",Chloe would like to say a few words.

tt0137523,"00:12:57,233","00:13:00,826",I no longer have any fear of death.
tt0137523,"00:13:04,589","00:13:08,182",But... I am in a pretty lonely place.
tt0137523,"00:13:09,187","00:13:11,177",No one will have sex with me.

tt0137523,"00:14:36,062","00:14:38,052",- I'm onto you. - What?
tt0137523,"00:14:38,141","00:14:41,131",Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.
tt0137523,"00:14:41,219","00:14:42,936",Sorry?
tt0137523,"00:14:43,018","00:14:47,806","In the Tibetan philosophy, Sylvia Plath sense of the word, I know we're all dying."
tt0137523,"00:14:47,896","00:14:51,933",- But you're not dying the way Chloe back there is dying. - So?
tt0137523,"00:14:52,493","00:14:54,483",So you're a tourist.
tt0137523,"00:14:54,572","00:14:58,609","I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma, I saw you at tuberculosis."

tt0137523,"00:15:13,522","00:15:16,274",Come together. Let yourselves cry.
tt0137523,"00:15:22,997","00:15:24,987","Oh, God. Why are you doing this?"
tt0137523,"00:15:25,076","00:15:27,748",It's cheaper than a movie and there's free coffee.
tt0137523,"00:15:27,835","00:15:30,472","Look, this is important. OK? These are my groups."
tt0137523,"00:15:30,553","00:15:32,588",I've been coming here for over a year.

tt0137523,"00:15:54,501","00:15:58,572","I'm not kidding. I can't cry if there's another faker person, and I need this."
tt0137523,"00:15:58,659","00:16:00,649",You got to find somewhere else to go.
tt0137523,"00:16:00,738","00:16:04,172",Candy-stripe a cancer ward. It's not my problem.
tt0137523,"00:16:07,174","00:16:09,164","No, wait a second. Hold on."
tt0137523,"00:16:09,253","00:16:11,243","We'll split up the week, OK?"
tt0137523,"00:16:11,332","00:16:13,447",You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.
tt0137523,"00:16:13,531","00:16:16,522",You take tuberculosis. My smoking doesn't go over at all.
tt0137523,"00:16:16,610","00:16:19,759",OK. Good. Fine. Testicular cancer should be no contest.
tt0137523,"00:16:19,848","00:16:23,600","Well, technically. I have more of a right to be there than you. You still have your balls."
tt0137523,"00:16:23,686","00:16:25,960",- You're kidding. - I don't know. Am I?
tt0137523,"00:16:26,604","00:16:28,003",No. No.
tt0137523,"00:16:28,084","00:16:30,596",- What do you want? - I'll take the parasites.
tt0137523,"00:16:30,682","00:16:33,354",You can't have both parasites. Take the blood parasites.
tt0137523,"00:16:33,441","00:16:37,591",- I want brain parasites. - I'll take the blood parasites and organic brain dementia.
tt0137523,"00:16:37,679","00:16:40,316",- I want that. - You can't have the whole brain.
tt0137523,"00:16:40,397","00:16:42,785","So far, you have four. I only have two."
tt0137523,"00:16:42,876","00:16:46,628",OK. Take blood parasites. They're yours.
tt0137523,"00:16:46,714","00:16:48,908",Now we both have three...
tt0137523,"00:16:51,511","00:16:54,070",Hey! You left half your clothes.
tt0137523,"00:17:09,902","00:17:11,971","- What, are you selling those? - Yes!"
tt0137523,"00:17:12,061","00:17:14,051",I'm selling some clothes!
tt0137523,"00:17:14,140","00:17:16,130",So! We each have three. That's six.
tt0137523,"00:17:16,219","00:17:18,936",What about the seventh day? I want ascending bowel cancer.
tt0137523,"00:17:19,017","00:17:21,007",The girl had done her homework.
tt0137523,"00:17:21,096","00:17:23,086",No. No. I want bowel cancer.
tt0137523,"00:17:23,735","00:17:25,725",That's your favourite too?
tt0137523,"00:17:25,814","00:17:29,168","- Tried to slip it by me, eh? - Look, we're gonna split it. OK?"
tt0137523,"00:17:29,252","00:17:31,242",Take the first and third Sunday of the month.
tt0137523,"00:17:33,609","00:17:35,406",Deal.
tt0137523,"00:17:37,887","00:17:40,116",Looks like this is goodbye.
tt0137523,"00:17:40,206","00:17:42,241",Let's not make a big thing out of it. OK?
tt0137523,"00:17:42,325","00:17:44,679",How's this for not making a big thing?
tt0137523,"00:17:48,002","00:17:49,753","Hey, Marla!"
tt0137523,"00:17:50,041","00:17:52,110",Marla!
tt0137523,"00:17:52,200","00:17:54,667",Maybe we should exchange numbers.

tt0137523,"00:18:05,553","00:18:07,986",This is how I met Marla Singer.
tt0137523,"00:18:09,631","00:18:13,702",Marla's philosophy of life was that she might die at any moment.
tt0137523,"00:18:13,789","00:18:15,982","The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't."
tt0137523,"00:18:16,067","00:18:19,944",It doesn't have your name! Who are you? Cornelius? Rupert?
tt0137523,"00:18:20,025","00:18:23,811",Travis? Any of the stupid names you give each night?
tt0137523,"00:18:26,662","00:18:28,652",You wake up at SeaTac.

tt0137523,"00:18:48,850","00:18:51,727",You wake up at Air Harbor International.

tt0137523,"00:19:36,386","00:19:39,979",I was a recall coordinator. My job was to apply the formula.
tt0137523,"00:19:40,064","00:19:42,338",Here's where the infant went through the windshield. Three points.
tt0137523,"00:19:42,423","00:19:46,334",A new car built by my company leaves somewhere travelling at 60mph.

tt0137523,"00:20:00,053","00:20:02,043",The father must have been huge.
tt0137523,"00:20:02,132","00:20:05,203",See how the fat burnt into the driver's seat with the polyester shirt?

tt0137523,"00:20:22,842","00:20:24,797",we don't do one.
tt0137523,"00:20:24,880","00:20:27,951",Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?
tt0137523,"00:20:28,039","00:20:29,869",You wouldn't believe.
tt0137523,"00:20:31,277","00:20:33,710",Which car company do you work for?
tt0137523,"00:20:33,796","00:20:35,786",A major one.

tt0137523,"00:23:59,569","00:24:01,559",it's an electric razor.
tt0137523,"00:24:01,648","00:24:03,683",But... every once in a while
tt0137523,"00:24:06,485","00:24:08,475",it's a dildo.
tt0137523,"00:24:09,204","00:24:13,115","Of course, it's company policy never to imply ownership in the event of a dildo."
tt0137523,"00:24:13,202","00:24:16,909","We have to use the indefinite article, a dildo, never"
tt0137523,"00:24:17,000","00:24:18,990",your dildo.
tt0137523,"00:24:19,079","00:24:21,069",I don't own...
tt0137523,"00:24:23,636","00:24:26,627",I had everything in that suitcase. My C.K. shirts.
tt0137523,"00:24:26,715","00:24:29,750",My D.K.N.Y. shoes. My A.X. ties.
tt0137523,"00:24:31,352","00:24:33,581",Never mind.
tt0137523,"00:24:35,390","00:24:37,983",Hey! That's my car!
tt0137523,"00:24:44,066","00:24:45,942",Home was a condo on the 15th floor
tt0137523,"00:24:46,025","00:24:48,935",of a filing cabinet for widows and young professionals.
tt0137523,"00:24:49,023","00:24:51,536",The walls were solid concrete.
tt0137523,"00:24:51,622","00:24:53,612",A foot of concrete is important
tt0137523,"00:24:53,701","00:24:57,772",when your next-door neighbour lets her hearing aid gonad has to watch games show at full volume.
tt0137523,"00:24:57,859","00:25:01,566",Or when a volcanic blast of debris that used to be your furniture and personal effects
tt0137523,"00:25:01,657","00:25:05,534",blows out of your floor-to-ceiling windows and sails flaming into the night.
tt0137523,"00:25:11,731","00:25:13,925",I suppose these things happen.
tt0137523,"00:25:26,244","00:25:28,234",There's... nothing up there.
tt0137523,"00:25:28,323","00:25:31,552",You can't go into the unit. Police orders.
tt0137523,"00:25:39,877","00:25:42,309",Do you have somebody you can call?
tt0137523,"00:25:42,395","00:25:44,430",How embarrassing.
tt0137523,"00:25:44,514","00:25:47,266",A house full of condiments and no food.
tt0137523,"00:25:56,308","00:25:59,935",The police would later tell me that the pilot light might have gone out
tt0137523,"00:26:00,906","00:26:03,737",letting out just a little bit of gas.
tt0137523,"00:26:03,824","00:26:05,973",That gas could have slowly filled the condo.
tt0137523,"00:26:06,063","00:26:09,451","17-handred square feet with high ceilings, for days and days."
tt0137523,"00:26:17,297","00:26:20,924",Then the refrigerator's compressor could have clicked on.
tt0137523,"00:26:21,975","00:26:23,965",Yeah?
tt0137523,"00:26:26,932","00:26:28,922",I can hear you breathing...
tt0137523,"00:26:37,247","00:26:40,999","If you ask me now, I couldn't tell you why I called him."
tt0137523,"00:27:22,463","00:27:24,578",- Hello? - Who's this?
tt0137523,"00:27:26,741","00:27:28,731",#NAME?
tt0137523,"00:27:30,219","00:27:32,334",We met... We met on the airplane.
tt0137523,"00:27:32,418","00:27:34,567",We had the same suitcase?
tt0137523,"00:27:34,657","00:27:36,647",The clever guy?
tt0137523,"00:27:36,736","00:27:38,965","Oh, yeah. Right."
tt0137523,"00:27:40,894","00:27:43,453",I called a second ago. There was no answer.
tt0137523,"00:27:43,532","00:27:47,523","- I'm at a payphone. - Yeah, I *69'd you. I never pick up my phone."
tt0137523,"00:27:50,209","00:27:52,199",So what's up?
tt0137523,"00:27:52,848","00:27:54,803",Well.
tt0137523,"00:27:54,887","00:27:56,877",You're not gonna believe this.
tt0137523,"00:27:58,924","00:28:01,039","You know, it could be worse."
tt0137523,"00:28:01,123","00:28:04,716",A woman could cut off your penis while you sleep and toss it out of the window of a moving car.
tt0137523,"00:28:05,561","00:28:08,676",There's always that. I don't know.
tt0137523,"00:28:08,759","00:28:11,750","When you buy furniture, you tell yourself, that's it."
tt0137523,"00:28:11,838","00:28:13,828",That's the last sofa I'm gonna need.
tt0137523,"00:28:13,917","00:28:16,588","Whatever else happens, I've got the sofa problem handled."
tt0137523,"00:28:16,675","00:28:19,984",I had it all. I had a stereo that was very decent.
tt0137523,"00:28:20,073","00:28:23,462",A wardrobe that was getting very respectable.
tt0137523,"00:28:23,552","00:28:25,621",I was close to being complete.
tt0137523,"00:28:25,711","00:28:28,143","- Shit, man. Now it's all gone. - All gone."
tt0137523,"00:28:28,229","00:28:30,867",All gone.
tt0137523,"00:28:32,067","00:28:34,022",Do you know what a duvet is?
tt0137523,"00:28:34,106","00:28:36,858",- A comforter. - It's a blanket.
tt0137523,"00:28:36,945","00:28:40,777",Just a blanket. Why do guys like you and I know what a duvet is?
tt0137523,"00:28:40,863","00:28:44,854",Is this essential to our survival in the hunter-gatherer sense of the word?
tt0137523,"00:28:44,941","00:28:46,498",No.
tt0137523,"00:28:46,580","00:28:48,490","What are we, then?"
tt0137523,"00:28:48,579","00:28:51,045",I don't know. Consumers.
tt0137523,"00:28:51,137","00:28:53,127",Right. We're consumers.
tt0137523,"00:28:53,216","00:28:56,366",We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession.
tt0137523,"00:28:56,455","00:29:00,207","Murder, crime, poverty. These things don't concern me."
tt0137523,"00:29:00,293","00:29:03,567","What concerns me are celebrity magazines,"
tt0137523,"00:29:03,651","00:29:05,641","television with 500 channels,"
tt0137523,"00:29:05,730","00:29:08,288",some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine.
tt0137523,"00:29:08,368","00:29:10,358",Viagra. Olestra.
tt0137523,"00:29:10,447","00:29:13,165",#NAME?
tt0137523,"00:29:13,246","00:29:16,600","Martha's polishes on the brass of the Titanic. It's all going down, man."
tt0137523,"00:29:16,684","00:29:20,277",So fuck off with your sofa units and Strinne green stripe patterns.
tt0137523,"00:29:20,362","00:29:23,512",I say never be complete.
tt0137523,"00:29:23,600","00:29:25,555",I say stop being perfect.
tt0137523,"00:29:25,639","00:29:27,594",I say let's evolve.
tt0137523,"00:29:27,678","00:29:29,872",Let the chips fall where they may.
tt0137523,"00:29:31,956","00:29:33,946","But that's me, and I could be wrong."
tt0137523,"00:29:34,035","00:29:36,025",Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
tt0137523,"00:29:36,114","00:29:38,502",It's just stuff. Not a tragedy...
tt0137523,"00:29:38,593","00:29:42,186",You did lose a lot of versatile solutions for modern living.
tt0137523,"00:29:42,271","00:29:44,737","Fuck, you're right. I don't smoke."
tt0137523,"00:29:47,988","00:29:51,581","My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so..."
tt0137523,"00:29:53,945","00:29:55,980",What?
tt0137523,"00:29:56,064","00:29:59,054",The things you own end up owning you.
tt0137523,"00:30:02,260","00:30:04,250","Do what you like, man."
tt0137523,"00:30:04,939","00:30:07,293","Oh, it's late."
tt0137523,"00:30:07,378","00:30:09,970",#NAME?
tt0137523,"00:30:10,056","00:30:12,046",I should find a hotel.
tt0137523,"00:30:12,775","00:30:14,765",What?
tt0137523,"00:30:14,854","00:30:16,411",What?
tt0137523,"00:30:16,493","00:30:18,483",#NAME?

tt0137523,"00:30:26,168","00:30:27,725",What?
tt0137523,"00:30:27,807","00:30:30,366",You called me because you needed a place to stay.
tt0137523,"00:30:30,446","00:30:33,720",#NAME?
tt0137523,"00:30:33,804","00:30:36,271","Cut the foreplay and just ask, man."
tt0137523,"00:30:38,002","00:30:40,151",Would... Would that be a problem?
tt0137523,"00:30:40,241","00:30:42,231",Is it a problem for you to ask?
tt0137523,"00:30:43,199","00:30:45,348",#NAME?
tt0137523,"00:30:46,677","00:30:48,667",Thanks.
tt0137523,"00:30:52,634","00:30:55,511",#NAME?
tt0137523,"00:30:55,593","00:30:57,900",I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
tt0137523,"00:30:57,991","00:30:59,867",What?
tt0137523,"00:30:59,950","00:31:03,623",I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
tt0137523,"00:31:03,708","00:31:06,505",Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.
tt0137523,"00:31:06,707","00:31:08,936",Tyler was a night person.
tt0137523,"00:31:09,026","00:31:11,175","While the rest of us were sleeping, he worked."
tt0137523,"00:31:11,265","00:31:14,300",He had one part-time job as a projectionist.
tt0137523,"00:31:14,383","00:31:17,259",A movie doesn't come all on one big reel. It comes on a few.
tt0137523,"00:31:17,341","00:31:20,889",So someone has to be there to switch the projectors at the exact moment
tt0137523,"00:31:20,979","00:31:24,095",that one reel ends and the next one begins.
tt0137523,"00:31:24,178","00:31:27,930",If you look for it you can see little dots coming into the upper right hand corner of the screen.
tt0137523,"00:31:28,016","00:31:30,608","In the industry, we call them cigarette burns."
tt0137523,"00:31:30,694","00:31:32,684",That's the cue for a changeover.
tt0137523,"00:31:32,773","00:31:37,322","He flips the projectors, movie keeps right on going and nobody in the audience has any idea."
tt0137523,"00:31:37,411","00:31:39,560",Why would anyone want this shitjob?
tt0137523,"00:31:39,650","00:31:42,685",Because it affords him other interesting opportunities.
tt0137523,"00:31:42,768","00:31:46,156",Like splicing single frames of pornography into family films.
tt0137523,"00:31:46,246","00:31:51,034","So when the snooty cat and the courageous dog, with the celebrity voices,"
tt0137523,"00:31:51,124","00:31:55,161",that's when you'll catch a flash of Tyler's contribution in the film.
tt0137523,"00:32:01,758","00:32:04,271",Nobody knows that they saw it but they did.
tt0137523,"00:32:04,357","00:32:06,790","Nice, big cock."
tt0137523,"00:32:11,393","00:32:14,065",Even a hummingbird couldn't catch Tyler at work.
tt0137523,"00:32:19,149","00:32:23,982",Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet waiter at the luxurious Pressman hotel.
tt0137523,"00:32:28,464","00:32:32,341",He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
tt0137523,"00:32:32,422","00:32:34,616",Do not watch. I cannot go when you watch.
tt0137523,"00:32:34,701","00:32:38,931","Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque, he farted on meringues,"
tt0137523,"00:32:39,019","00:32:41,452",and as for the cream of mushroom soup... well...
tt0137523,"00:32:41,538","00:32:43,493","Go ahead, tell 'em."
tt0137523,"00:32:43,577","00:32:45,487",You get the idea.
tt0137523,"00:32:45,695","00:32:48,766",#NAME?
tt0137523,"00:32:48,854","00:32:52,083",- Why? - I don't know. Never been in a fight. You?
tt0137523,"00:32:52,172","00:32:56,004","- No. But that's a good thing. -  No, it is not! How much can you know about yourself"
tt0137523,"00:32:56,090","00:32:58,319",I don't wanna die without any scars.
tt0137523,"00:32:58,409","00:33:02,525",#NAME?
tt0137523,"00:33:02,607","00:33:04,801",So go crazy! Let it rip.
tt0137523,"00:33:04,885","00:33:07,444",- I don't know about this. - I don't either.
tt0137523,"00:33:07,524","00:33:10,481",Who gives a shit? No one's watching. What do you care?
tt0137523,"00:33:10,563","00:33:12,916",This is crazy. You want me to hit you?!
tt0137523,"00:33:13,001","00:33:14,991",That's right.
tt0137523,"00:33:15,080","00:33:18,151",#NAME?
tt0137523,"00:33:20,237","00:33:22,227",This is so fucking stupid.
tt0137523,"00:33:32,671","00:33:34,740",Motherfucker!
tt0137523,"00:33:34,830","00:33:36,820",He hit me in the ear!
tt0137523,"00:33:36,909","00:33:39,979","- Well, Jesus, I'm sorry. - Ow, Christ!"
tt0137523,"00:33:40,067","00:33:42,057",#NAME?
tt0137523,"00:33:42,146","00:33:43,783","No, that was perfect."
tt0137523,"00:33:56,139","00:33:58,174","No, it's all right."
tt0137523,"00:33:58,977","00:34:00,967",It really hurts.
tt0137523,"00:34:01,416","00:34:03,406",Right.
tt0137523,"00:34:03,735","00:34:05,850",Hit me again.
tt0137523,"00:34:05,934","00:34:07,969","No, you hit me. Come on!"
tt0137523,"00:34:24,204","00:34:26,592",We should do this again sometime.
tt0137523,"00:34:38,877","00:34:40,992",- Where's your car? - What car?
tt0137523,"00:34:51,070","00:34:53,344",I don't know how Tyler found that house
tt0137523,"00:34:53,429","00:34:55,578",but he said he'd been there for a year.
tt0137523,"00:34:55,668","00:34:58,419",It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.
tt0137523,"00:34:58,506","00:35:00,814",Most of the windows were boarded up.
tt0137523,"00:35:00,905","00:35:06,023","There was no lock on the front door from where the police, or whoever, kicked it in."
tt0137523,"00:35:06,102","00:35:08,092",The stairs were ready to collapse.
tt0137523,"00:35:08,181","00:35:10,614",I didn't know if he owned it or he was squatting.
tt0137523,"00:35:10,700","00:35:13,088",Neither would have surprised me.
tt0137523,"00:35:13,938","00:35:15,928",Yep. That's you.
tt0137523,"00:35:16,017","00:35:18,484",That's me. That's the toilet. Good?
tt0137523,"00:35:18,576","00:35:20,566","Yeah, thanks."
tt0137523,"00:35:20,655","00:35:22,485",What a shit hole.
tt0137523,"00:35:22,574","00:35:24,450",Nothing worked.
tt0137523,"00:35:27,931","00:35:31,717",Turning on one light meant another light in the house went out.
tt0137523,"00:35:31,809","00:35:35,402",There were no neighbours. Just some warehouses and a papermill.
tt0137523,"00:35:35,487","00:35:39,319","That fart smell of steam, the hamster cage smell of wood chips."
tt0137523,"00:35:41,004","00:35:43,278",What have we here?
tt0137523,"00:35:57,476","00:35:59,511",#NAME?
tt0137523,"00:36:10,029","00:36:12,986","Every time it rained, we had to kill the power."
tt0137523,"00:36:13,827","00:36:17,057","By the end of the first month, I didn't miss TV."
tt0137523,"00:36:18,065","00:36:21,260","I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator."
tt0137523,"00:36:33,137","00:36:35,127",Can I be next?
tt0137523,"00:36:39,374","00:36:41,364","All right, man."
tt0137523,"00:36:41,453","00:36:43,363",Lose the tie.
tt0137523,"00:36:47,210","00:36:51,406","At night, Tyler and I were alone for half a mile in every direction."
tt0137523,"00:36:56,645","00:37:00,397",Rain trickled down through the plaster and the light fixtures.
tt0137523,"00:37:00,483","00:37:03,201",Everything wooden swelled and shrunk.
tt0137523,"00:37:03,282","00:37:06,352",Everywhere were rusted nails to snagy our elbow on.
tt0137523,"00:37:06,440","00:37:08,907",The previous occupant had been a bit of shut-in.
tt0137523,"00:37:08,999","00:37:10,989","Hey, man. What are you reading?"
tt0137523,"00:37:11,078","00:37:15,273",Listen to this. It's an article written by an organ in the first person.
tt0137523,"00:37:15,355","00:37:17,993","""I am Jack's medulla oblongata. Without me,"
tt0137523,"00:37:18,074","00:37:21,382","Jack could not regulate his heart rate, blood pressure or breathing."""
tt0137523,"00:37:21,472","00:37:23,462",There's a whole series of these.
tt0137523,"00:37:23,551","00:37:25,541","""I Am Jill's Nipples."""
tt0137523,"00:37:27,469","00:37:31,301",#VALUE!
tt0137523,"00:37:34,425","00:37:38,052","After fighting, everything else in life got the volume turned down."
tt0137523,"00:37:38,143","00:37:41,612",What?
tt0137523,"00:37:41,702","00:37:45,090",You could deal with anything. - Have you finished those reports?
tt0137523,"00:37:49,577","00:37:52,044","If you could fight anyone, who would you fight?"
tt0137523,"00:37:52,136","00:37:54,126","I'd fight my boss, probably."
tt0137523,"00:37:54,215","00:37:56,250",Really?
tt0137523,"00:37:56,334","00:37:59,529","- Yeah, why? Who would you fight? - I'd fight my dad."
tt0137523,"00:37:59,612","00:38:01,602",I don't know my dad.
tt0137523,"00:38:01,691","00:38:03,521","I mean, I know him, but..."
tt0137523,"00:38:03,610","00:38:05,884",He left when I was like six years old.
tt0137523,"00:38:05,969","00:38:08,845",Married this other woman and had some other kids.
tt0137523,"00:38:08,927","00:38:10,917",He did this every six years.
tt0137523,"00:38:11,006","00:38:14,963",- He goes to a new city and starts a new family. - Fucker's setting up franchises!
tt0137523,"00:38:15,764","00:38:17,754",My dad never went to college.
tt0137523,"00:38:17,843","00:38:21,595",#NAME?
tt0137523,"00:38:21,681","00:38:25,957","So I graduate. Call him up long-distance and say, ""Dad, now what?"""
tt0137523,"00:38:26,039","00:38:27,949","- He says, ""Get a job."" - Same here."
tt0137523,"00:38:28,038","00:38:30,596",Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.
tt0137523,"00:38:30,676","00:38:32,586","""Dad, now what?"""
tt0137523,"00:38:32,675","00:38:34,710","He says, ""I don't know. Get married."""
tt0137523,"00:38:34,794","00:38:38,102",I can't get married.
tt0137523,"00:38:38,832","00:38:40,822",I'm a 30-year-old boy.
tt0137523,"00:38:40,911","00:38:43,299",We're a generation of men raised by women.
tt0137523,"00:38:43,390","00:38:47,460",I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.
tt0137523,"00:38:53,224","00:38:56,295","Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet."
tt0137523,"00:38:57,142","00:39:00,451","But every Saturday night, we were finding something out."
tt0137523,"00:39:01,620","00:39:04,928",We were finding out more and more that we were not alone.
tt0137523,"00:39:08,696","00:39:13,165","It used to be that when I came home angry or depressed, I'd just clean my condo."
tt0137523,"00:39:13,254","00:39:15,244",Polish my Scandinavian furniture.
tt0137523,"00:39:15,333","00:39:20,165",I should have been looking for a new condo or I should have been
tt0137523,"00:39:20,250","00:39:23,877",I should have been upset about my nice neat flaming little shit.
tt0137523,"00:39:23,968","00:39:25,798",But I wasn't.
tt0137523,"00:39:25,887","00:39:29,401",The basic premise of cyber netting any office is make things more efficient.
tt0137523,"00:39:29,486","00:39:32,203",Monday mornings all I could do was to think about next week.
tt0137523,"00:39:32,284","00:39:35,195",Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?
tt0137523,"00:39:35,283","00:39:36,351",Absolutely.
tt0137523,"00:39:36,442","00:39:39,557","Efficiency is priority No.1, people."
tt0137523,"00:39:39,680","00:39:42,352",Because waste is a thief.
tt0137523,"00:39:42,439","00:39:45,429","I showed this already to my man here. You liked it, didn't you?"
tt0137523,"00:39:48,955","00:39:52,708",You can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick.
tt0137523,"00:39:53,713","00:39:55,862",It was right in everyone's face.
tt0137523,"00:39:55,952","00:39:58,021",Tyler and I just made it visible.
tt0137523,"00:39:58,111","00:40:00,418",It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.
tt0137523,"00:40:00,509","00:40:02,499",Tyler and I just gave it a name.
tt0137523,"00:40:13,263","00:40:15,253","Come on people, you've gotta go home!"
tt0137523,"00:40:36,571","00:40:38,765",Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.
tt0137523,"00:40:58,839","00:41:02,386","Every week, Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided."
tt0137523,"00:41:02,477","00:41:04,467",Gentlemen!
tt0137523,"00:41:05,196","00:41:07,186",Welcome to Fight Club.
tt0137523,"00:41:09,234","00:41:11,303",The first rule of Fight Club is
tt0137523,"00:41:11,393","00:41:13,666",you do not talk about Fight Club.
tt0137523,"00:41:13,751","00:41:16,218",The second rule of Fight Club is
tt0137523,"00:41:16,630","00:41:19,938",you do not talk about Fight Club!
tt0137523,"00:41:20,028","00:41:22,222",Third rule of Fight Club.
tt0137523,"00:41:22,307","00:41:24,979","Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,"
tt0137523,"00:41:25,065","00:41:27,703",the fight is over. Fourth rule.
tt0137523,"00:41:27,784","00:41:30,013",Only two guys to a fight.
tt0137523,"00:41:30,103","00:41:31,899",Fifth rule.
tt0137523,"00:41:31,982","00:41:34,541","One fight at a time, fellas."
tt0137523,"00:41:34,621","00:41:37,008",Sixth rule. No shirts. No shoes.
tt0137523,"00:41:37,099","00:41:40,851",Seventh rule. Fights will go on as long as they have to.
tt0137523,"00:41:42,616","00:41:45,083",And the eighth and final rule.
tt0137523,"00:41:46,175","00:41:49,245",If this is your first night at Fight Club
tt0137523,"00:41:49,333","00:41:51,323",you have to fight.
tt0137523,"00:41:55,210","00:41:57,200","This kid from work, Ricky,"
tt0137523,"00:41:57,289","00:42:01,599",couldn't remember whether you ordered pens with blue ink or black.
tt0137523,"00:42:01,686","00:42:03,994",But Ricky was a god for ten minutes
tt0137523,"00:42:04,085","00:42:07,281",when he trounced the maitre d' of the local food court.
tt0137523,"00:42:09,083","00:42:14,200","Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat, hard, packing sounds over the yelling."
tt0137523,"00:42:17,798","00:42:20,709",Or the wet choke when someone caught their breath and sprayed...
tt0137523,"00:42:20,797","00:42:22,752",Stop!
tt0137523,"00:42:22,835","00:42:25,587",You weren't alive anywhere like you were there.
tt0137523,"00:42:25,674","00:42:30,268",But Fight Club only exists in the hours between when Fight Club starts and ends.
tt0137523,"00:42:30,791","00:42:33,702","Even if I could tell someone they had a good fight,"
tt0137523,"00:42:33,790","00:42:35,984",I wouldn't be talking to the same man.
tt0137523,"00:42:36,069","00:42:39,264",Who you were in Fight Club is not who you were in the rest of the world.
tt0137523,"00:42:39,347","00:42:44,179",A guy came to Fight Club for the first time. His ass was a wad of cookie dough.
tt0137523,"00:42:44,264","00:42:46,982","After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood."
tt0137523,"00:42:47,783","00:42:50,853","If you could fight any celebrity, who would you fight?"
tt0137523,"00:42:50,941","00:42:53,931",- Alive or dead? - Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?
tt0137523,"00:42:54,819","00:42:57,809",Hemingway. You?
tt0137523,"00:42:58,417","00:43:01,452",Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.
tt0137523,"00:43:02,455","00:43:05,525",We all started seeing things differently.
tt0137523,"00:43:06,733","00:43:09,962","Everywhere we went, we were sizing things up."
tt0137523,"00:43:13,169","00:43:16,160","I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,"
tt0137523,"00:43:16,248","00:43:20,159",trying to look like how Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.
tt0137523,"00:43:20,246","00:43:22,281",Is that what a man looks like?
tt0137523,"00:43:23,164","00:43:25,882","Oh, self-improvement is masturbation."
tt0137523,"00:43:25,963","00:43:27,953","Now, self-destruction..."
tt0137523,"00:43:28,042","00:43:29,952",Excuse me.
tt0137523,"00:44:03,143","00:44:06,214",Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.
tt0137523,"00:44:06,302","00:44:08,292",It wasn't about words.
tt0137523,"00:44:10,140","00:44:13,494",The hysterical shouting was in tongues
tt0137523,"00:44:13,578","00:44:15,454",like at a Pentecostal Church.
tt0137523,"00:44:19,815","00:44:21,805",- Is that it? - Stop!
tt0137523,"00:44:21,894","00:44:24,645","When the fight was over, nothing was solved."
tt0137523,"00:44:24,732","00:44:26,562",But nothing mattered.
tt0137523,"00:44:26,651","00:44:29,323",Cool.
tt0137523,"00:44:29,410","00:44:32,081","Afterwards, we all felt saved."
tt0137523,"00:44:32,968","00:44:35,162","Hey, man. How about next week?"
tt0137523,"00:44:35,247","00:44:37,237",How about next month?!
tt0137523,"00:44:37,326","00:44:39,316","Irvine, you're in the middle."
tt0137523,"00:44:39,404","00:44:41,359","New guy, you too."
tt0137523,"00:44:43,043","00:44:45,112","Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me."
tt0137523,"00:44:45,201","00:44:47,191",He fell down some stairs.
tt0137523,"00:44:47,840","00:44:49,830",I fell down some stairs.
tt0137523,"00:44:51,598","00:44:56,067",Fight Club became the reason to cut your hair short or trim your fingernails.
tt0137523,"00:44:56,156","00:44:58,544",OK. Any historical figure.
tt0137523,"00:44:58,634","00:45:00,431",I'd fight Gandhi.
tt0137523,"00:45:01,033","00:45:02,784",Good answer.
tt0137523,"00:45:02,872","00:45:05,021",#NAME?
tt0137523,"00:45:05,111","00:45:07,578",Lincoln?
tt0137523,"00:45:07,670","00:45:11,138","Big guy, big reach. Skinny guys fight till they're burger."
tt0137523,"00:45:11,988","00:45:13,978",Fuck!
tt0137523,"00:45:15,106","00:45:17,699","Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart."
tt0137523,"00:45:26,420","00:45:27,738",Hello?
tt0137523,"00:45:27,819","00:45:30,127",Where have you been the last eight weeks?
tt0137523,"00:45:30,218","00:45:31,445",Marla?
tt0137523,"00:45:34,296","00:45:37,331",#NAME?
tt0137523,"00:45:37,414","00:45:40,291",I haven't seen you at any support groups.
tt0137523,"00:45:40,373","00:45:43,443",We split'em up. That was the idea. Remember?
tt0137523,"00:45:43,531","00:45:46,249","Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours."
tt0137523,"00:45:46,330","00:45:49,684",#NAME?
tt0137523,"00:45:49,768","00:45:51,519",I found a new one.
tt0137523,"00:45:52,047","00:45:54,241",- Really? - It's for men only.
tt0137523,"00:45:54,326","00:45:55,838",Like the testicle thing?
tt0137523,"00:45:59,443","00:46:01,398","Look, this is a bad time."
tt0137523,"00:46:01,482","00:46:03,836",I've been going to Debtor's Anonymous.
tt0137523,"00:46:03,921","00:46:07,309",- You want to see some really fucked up people? - I'm just on my way out.
tt0137523,"00:46:07,399","00:46:09,673",Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.
tt0137523,"00:46:09,758","00:46:11,951",I took what was left of a bottle.
tt0137523,"00:46:12,036","00:46:14,026",It might have been too much.
tt0137523,"00:46:14,115","00:46:17,583",Just picture watching Marla Singer throwing herself around her crummy apartment.
tt0137523,"00:46:17,713","00:46:22,023",This isn't a for-real-suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for-help thing.
tt0137523,"00:46:22,111","00:46:24,908","This could go on for hours. - So you're staying in tonight, then?"
tt0137523,"00:46:24,990","00:46:27,707","Do you wanna wait, and hear me describe death?"
tt0137523,"00:46:27,788","00:46:32,098",Do you wanna listen and see if my spirit can use a phone?
tt0137523,"00:46:34,265","00:46:36,823",Have you ever heard a death rattle before?
tt0137523,"00:47:02,010","00:47:06,638",Tyler's door was closed. I'd been living here for two months and Tyler's door was never closed.
tt0137523,"00:47:11,445","00:47:14,402",You won't believe this dream I had last night.
tt0137523,"00:47:14,484","00:47:17,633",I can hardly believe anything about last night.
tt0137523,"00:47:27,037","00:47:28,913",What are you doing here?
tt0137523,"00:47:31,515","00:47:33,505",What?
tt0137523,"00:47:33,594","00:47:35,948",This is my house. What are you doing in my house?
tt0137523,"00:47:38,232","00:47:40,142",Fuck you!
tt0137523,"00:47:54,183","00:47:57,379","Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends! I'm telling you!"
tt0137523,"00:47:57,462","00:47:59,372","Limber, though."
tt0137523,"00:47:59,461","00:48:01,371",Silly coos.
tt0137523,"00:48:02,419","00:48:05,012","So, I come in last night. Phone's off the hook."
tt0137523,"00:48:05,098","00:48:07,088",Guess who's on the other end?
tt0137523,"00:48:07,177","00:48:09,291",I already knew the story before he told it to me.
tt0137523,"00:48:11,494","00:48:14,928",Have you ever heard a death rattle before?
tt0137523,"00:48:15,012","00:48:17,730",Do you think it'll live up to its name?
tt0137523,"00:48:17,811","00:48:21,245",Or will it just be a death hairball?
tt0137523,"00:48:24,527","00:48:28,359",Prepare to evacuate soul.

tt0137523,"01:11:33,949","01:11:37,384","This week, each one of you has a homework assignment."
tt0137523,"01:11:37,468","01:11:42,095",You're gonna go out. You're gonna start a fight with a total stranger.
tt0137523,"01:11:45,223","01:11:47,292",You're gonna start a fight
tt0137523,"01:11:47,382","01:11:49,372",and you're gonna lose.

tt0137523,"01:11:59,136","01:12:01,695","Now, this is not as easy as it sounds."
tt0137523,"01:12:04,294","01:12:06,170",Son of a bitch!
tt0137523,"01:12:06,253","01:12:10,801","Most people, normal people, do just about anything to avoid a fight."

tt0137523,"01:12:13,769","01:12:17,316",You sprayed me with your hose. That's not necessary...
tt0137523,"01:12:17,407","01:12:19,237",Jay! Go call 911!
tt0137523,"01:12:21,884","01:12:23,839",Put the hose down.
tt0137523,"01:12:23,923","01:12:25,913",Stop it! Stop it!

tt0137523,"01:12:44,193","01:12:46,547",We need to talk.
tt0137523,"01:12:48,710","01:12:50,700",OK.
tt0137523,"01:12:50,789","01:12:52,779",Where to begin?
tt0137523,"01:12:52,868","01:12:54,983",With your constant absenteeism?
tt0137523,"01:12:55,067","01:12:57,500",With your unpresentable appearance?
tt0137523,"01:12:57,586","01:12:59,541",You're up for review.
tt0137523,"01:12:59,625","01:13:02,695",I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.
tt0137523,"01:13:02,783","01:13:04,613",- What? - Let's pretend.
tt0137523,"01:13:04,702","01:13:07,454","You're the Department of Transportation, OK?"
tt0137523,"01:13:07,541","01:13:11,054",Someone informs you that this company
tt0137523,"01:13:11,139","01:13:15,050","installs front-seat mounting brackets that naver pass collision tests,"
tt0137523,"01:13:15,137","01:13:18,411","brake linings that fail after a thousand miles,"
tt0137523,"01:13:18,495","01:13:22,725",and fuel injectors that explode and burn people alive.
tt0137523,"01:13:22,813","01:13:24,609",What then?
tt0137523,"01:13:24,692","01:13:26,886",Are you threatening me?
tt0137523,"01:13:26,971","01:13:29,642",- No... - Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!
tt0137523,"01:13:29,729","01:13:33,959",I have a better solution. You keep me on the payroll as an outside consultant.
tt0137523,"01:13:34,047","01:13:36,037","In exchange for my salary,"
tt0137523,"01:13:36,126","01:13:39,799",my job will be never to tell people these things that I know.
tt0137523,"01:13:39,884","01:13:44,000",I don't even have to come into the office. I can do this job from home.
tt0137523,"01:13:45,241","01:13:49,198","Who... Who the fuck do you think you are, you crazy little shit?"
tt0137523,"01:13:54,236","01:13:57,625",- Security! I am Jack's smirking revenge.
tt0137523,"01:14:06,230","01:14:08,265",What the hell are you doing?
tt0137523,"01:14:17,065","01:14:19,055",That hurt.
tt0137523,"01:14:20,463","01:14:22,453",Why would you do that?
tt0137523,"01:14:23,061","01:14:25,938","Oh, my God! No! Please stop!"
tt0137523,"01:14:34,935","01:14:36,925",What are you doing?
tt0137523,"01:14:37,974","01:14:39,964","Oh, God, no! Please! No!"
tt0137523,"01:14:40,053","01:14:43,964","For some reason, I thought of my first fight, with Tyler."
tt0137523,"01:14:44,051","01:14:45,608",No!
tt0137523,"01:15:08,998","01:15:13,307","Under and behind and inside everything this man took for granted,"
tt0137523,"01:15:13,395","01:15:16,704",something horrible had been growing.
tt0137523,"01:15:16,794","01:15:17,828",Look.
tt0137523,"01:15:17,913","01:15:22,427","Give me the paychecks, like I asked, and you won't ever see me again."
tt0137523,"01:15:22,511","01:15:25,182","And right then, at our most excellent moment together..."
tt0137523,"01:15:28,108","01:15:30,779",Thank God! Please don't hit me again.
tt0137523,"01:15:30,866","01:15:32,856","Telephone, computer,"

tt0137523,"01:15:37,983","01:15:40,290",We now had corporate sponsorship.
tt0137523,"01:15:40,381","01:15:45,294",This is how Tyler and I were able to have Fight Club every night of the week.
tt0137523,"01:15:47,857","01:15:51,292",Now nobody was the centre of Fight Club except the two men fighting.
tt0137523,"01:15:51,376","01:15:54,730","The leader walked through the crowd, out in the darkness."
tt0137523,"01:15:56,413","01:16:00,723",Tyler was now involved in class-action a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel
tt0137523,"01:16:00,811","01:16:03,005",over the urine content of their soup.
tt0137523,"01:16:07,967","01:16:10,843",I am Jack's wasted life.
tt0137523,"01:16:18,242","01:16:20,232","Thank you, sir."
tt0137523,"01:16:21,680","01:16:24,556",Tyler dreamed up new homework assignments.
tt0137523,"01:16:24,638","01:16:27,071",He handed them out in sealed envelopes.
tt0137523,"01:17:04,617","01:17:08,131","- There's a Fight Club up in Delaware City. - Yeah, I heard."

tt0137523,"01:38:38,225","01:38:40,579",The house had become a living thing.
tt0137523,"01:38:40,664","01:38:45,099",Wet inside from so many people sweating and breathing.
tt0137523,"01:38:45,581","01:38:48,048","So many people moving, the house moved."

tt0137523,"01:38:58,055","01:39:01,682",You shouldn't be smoking in here! You know how much ether we have
tt0137523,"01:39:01,773","01:39:04,161",Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.

tt0137523,"01:39:36,195","01:39:38,071",Right... OK.
tt0137523,"01:39:40,393","01:39:42,383",I'm all alone.
tt0137523,"01:39:42,552","01:39:46,065",My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.

tt0137523,"01:39:52,347","01:39:55,974",What comes next in Project Mayhem only Tyler knows.
tt0137523,"01:39:56,864","01:39:59,935",The second rule is you do not ask questions.

tt0137523,"01:40:26,489","01:40:29,923",Tyler isn't here.
tt0137523,"01:40:30,007","01:40:31,997",Tyler went away.
tt0137523,"01:40:32,406","01:40:34,396",Tyler's gone.

tt0137523,"01:44:53,430","01:44:58,263",Tyler had been busy... setting up franchises all over the country.
tt0137523,"01:45:00,906","01:45:05,182",Was I asleep? Had I slept?

tt0137523,"01:45:28,692","01:45:30,568",I felt I'd already been there.
tt0137523,"01:45:30,651","01:45:33,447",It was like following an invisible man.
tt0137523,"01:45:34,489","01:45:36,479","The smell of dried blood,"
tt0137523,"01:45:36,568","01:45:39,956","dirty, bare footprints circling each other."
tt0137523,"01:45:40,766","01:45:43,836","That aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken."
tt0137523,"01:45:43,924","01:45:47,312",The feel of a floor still warm from a fight the night before.
tt0137523,"01:45:48,162","01:45:50,958",I was always just one step behind Tyler.

tt0137523,"01:46:36,457","01:46:39,015",You're the one who gave me this.

tt0137523,"02:01:40,347","02:01:44,497","Or - maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent the whole day thinking about the wrong ones."
tt0137523,"02:01:52,700","02:01:53,735",You think?
tt0137523,"02:01:55,659","02:01:57,649","Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one."
tt0137523,"02:01:58,497","02:02:01,374",Pull anyone but the green one.
tt0137523,"02:02:05,894","02:02:08,406",I asked you not to do that!
tt0137523,"02:02:10,171","02:02:11,684",Fuck!
tt0137523,"02:02:12,570","02:02:14,605","Tyler, get away from the van."
tt0137523,"02:02:16,728","02:02:19,957","Tyler, I'm not kidding! Get away from the van!"
tt0137523,"02:02:20,046","02:02:21,364",Goddamn it!
tt0137523,"02:02:27,442","02:02:28,761",OK.
tt0137523,"02:02:28,842","02:02:32,071",You are now firing a gun at your imaginary friend
tt0137523,"02:02:32,160","02:02:34,627",near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!
tt0137523,"02:02:36,757","02:02:38,429","Cool it, Tyler! Tyler!"
tt0137523,"02:02:51,110","02:02:53,100",Come on!
tt0137523,"02:02:53,189","02:02:55,144",Don't go!
tt0137523,"02:03:31,169","02:03:32,318",What?!
tt0137523,"02:04:15,386","02:04:15,546",Three minutes.
tt0137523,"02:04:15,546","02:04:17,376",Three minutes.
tt0137523,"02:04:17,465","02:04:19,659",This is it.
tt0137523,"02:04:19,744","02:04:21,699",The beginning.
tt0137523,"02:04:21,783","02:04:23,659",Ground zero.
tt0137523,"02:04:23,742","02:04:25,936",I think this is about where we came in.
tt0137523,"02:04:26,021","02:04:28,374",Would you like to say a few words to mark the occasion?
tt0137523,"02:04:28,459","02:04:31,370",I'm sorry?
tt0137523,"02:04:31,458","02:04:33,448",I still can't think of anything.
tt0137523,"02:04:35,416","02:04:37,406",Flashback humour.
tt0137523,"02:04:42,292","02:04:44,247",It's getting exciting now.
tt0137523,"02:04:45,730","02:04:47,448",Two and a half.
tt0137523,"02:04:47,530","02:04:49,996","Think of everything we've accomplished, man."
tt0137523,"02:04:50,088","02:04:54,682","Out these windows, we will view the collapse of financial history."
tt0137523,"02:04:54,766","02:04:58,313",One step closer to economic equilibrium.
tt0137523,"02:05:11,357","02:05:13,631",Why is she here?
tt0137523,"02:05:13,716","02:05:15,546",Tying up loose ends.
tt0137523,"02:05:15,635","02:05:18,591","Put me down, you baldheaded fuck!"
tt0137523,"02:05:18,673","02:05:21,664","- I'm begging you, please don't do this. - I'm not doing this."
tt0137523,"02:05:21,752","02:05:25,060",#NAME?
tt0137523,"02:05:25,150","02:05:29,664",- I don't want this. - Right. Except you is meaningless now.
tt0137523,"02:05:29,748","02:05:33,580",- We have to forget about you. - You're a voice in my head.
tt0137523,"02:05:33,666","02:05:35,655",You're a voice in mine!
tt0137523,"02:05:35,744","02:05:38,462","-  You're a fucking hallucination, why can't I get rid of you?"
tt0137523,"02:05:38,543","02:05:40,533",No. I don't. I really don't any more.
tt0137523,"02:05:40,622","02:05:44,738",You created me. I didn't create some loser alter ego to make myself feel better.
tt0137523,"02:05:44,820","02:05:48,606",- Take some responsibility! - I do. I am responsible for all of it
tt0137523,"02:05:48,738","02:05:50,375",and I accept that.
tt0137523,"02:05:50,457","02:05:54,334","So, please, I'm begging you, please call this off."
tt0137523,"02:05:56,254","02:05:58,369",Have I ever let us down?
tt0137523,"02:05:59,732","02:06:01,961",How far have you come because of me?!
tt0137523,"02:06:07,608","02:06:09,598",I will bring us through this.
tt0137523,"02:06:09,687","02:06:13,314","As always, I will carry you kicking and screaming"
tt0137523,"02:06:13,405","02:06:15,713",and in the end you will thank me.
tt0137523,"02:06:16,203","02:06:18,591",Tyler. Tyler.
tt0137523,"02:06:18,682","02:06:22,070",I'm grateful to you. For everything that you've done for me.
tt0137523,"02:06:22,160","02:06:24,719",But this is too much. I don't want this.
tt0137523,"02:06:24,799","02:06:29,870",What do you want? Wanna go back to the shit job?
tt0137523,"02:06:29,956","02:06:31,946",Fuck you! I won't do it.
tt0137523,"02:06:32,755","02:06:36,428","- This can't be happening. - It's already done, so shut up!"
tt0137523,"02:06:36,513","02:06:38,070","Sixty seconds, can you see alright?"
tt0137523,"02:06:38,592","02:06:40,582",No.
tt0137523,"02:06:42,390","02:06:45,061",I can figure this out. I can figure this out. This is not for real.
tt0137523,"02:06:45,148","02:06:48,662","You're not real, that gun... That gun isn't even in your hand."
tt0137523,"02:06:50,106","02:06:52,096",The gun's in my hand.
tt0137523,"02:06:56,902","02:06:59,256","Hey, good for you. It doesn't change a thing."
tt0137523,"02:07:07,777","02:07:10,335",Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?
tt0137523,"02:07:10,415","02:07:12,405","Not my head, Tyler."
tt0137523,"02:07:12,974","02:07:14,929",Our head.
tt0137523,"02:07:16,372","02:07:18,362",Interesting.
tt0137523,"02:07:21,250","02:07:23,808","Where are you going with this, IKEA-boy?"
tt0137523,"02:07:30,005","02:07:32,882",Hey. It's you and me.
tt0137523,"02:07:35,482","02:07:37,472",Friends?
tt0137523,"02:07:38,281","02:07:40,271","Tyler,"
tt0137523,"02:07:43,558","02:07:45,832",I want you to really listen to me.
tt0137523,"02:07:45,917","02:07:48,271",OK.
tt0137523,"02:07:48,356","02:07:50,345",My eyes are open.
tt0137523,"02:08:08,305","02:08:10,260",What's that smell?
tt0137523,"02:08:29,054","02:08:31,931","- Where is everybody? - Oh, no. What's going on?"
tt0137523,"02:08:32,573","02:08:34,085",Mr. Durden!
tt0137523,"02:08:35,131","02:08:36,882","Oh, my God!"
tt0137523,"02:08:42,048","02:08:45,118","Are you... Are you all right, sir?"
tt0137523,"02:08:45,206","02:08:48,992","- Oh, yeah, I'm OK. - You look terrible, sir. What happened?"
tt0137523,"02:08:49,084","02:08:52,916","- Nothing, it's no problem. - No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding."
tt0137523,"02:08:53,002","02:08:55,640",#NAME?
tt0137523,"02:08:55,760","02:08:59,195","Look, I'm fine... Everything's fine."
tt0137523,"02:09:01,398","02:09:03,546",Stop it!
tt0137523,"02:09:03,636","02:09:06,627",- Let her go. - Christ Almighty!
tt0137523,"02:09:06,715","02:09:08,432",You!
tt0137523,"02:09:08,514","02:09:10,504","Hi, Marla."
tt0137523,"02:09:10,993","02:09:15,620",#NAME?
tt0137523,"02:09:15,710","02:09:17,700","Yes, I'm sure."
tt0137523,"02:09:18,749","02:09:22,705",You fucker! What kind of sick fucking game are you playing at?!
tt0137523,"02:09:22,786","02:09:25,379","Putting me on a fucking... Oh, my God, your face!"
tt0137523,"02:09:25,465","02:09:26,897","Yeah, I know."
tt0137523,"02:09:31,462","02:09:33,292",What happened?
tt0137523,"02:09:33,381","02:09:35,416",- Don't ask. - You're shot.
tt0137523,"02:09:35,500","02:09:37,490","- Yes, I'm shot. - Oh, my God."
tt0137523,"02:09:38,378","02:09:41,289",- I can't believe he's standing. - One tough motherfucker.
tt0137523,"02:09:44,935","02:09:46,731",Who did this?
tt0137523,"02:09:46,814","02:09:49,202","I did, actually."
tt0137523,"02:09:49,293","02:09:51,283",Find some gauze.
tt0137523,"02:09:52,571","02:09:54,526",You shot yourself?
tt0137523,"02:09:54,610","02:09:57,169","Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me."
tt0137523,"02:09:57,249","02:09:59,397",I'm really OK.
tt0137523,"02:09:59,487","02:10:03,273",Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine.
tt0137523,"02:10:15,559","02:10:19,311",You met me at a very strange time in my life.
tt0109830,"00:03:17,948","00:03:19,189",Hello.
tt0109830,"00:03:20,158","00:03:22,821",My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.
tt0109830,"00:03:28,375","00:03:30,412",Do you want a chocolate?
tt0109830,"00:03:33,004","00:03:36,418",I could eat about a million and a half of these.
tt0109830,"00:03:37,592","00:03:42,804",My mama always said life was like a box of chocolates.
tt0109830,"00:03:44,808","00:03:47,676",You never know what you're gonna get.
tt0109830,"00:03:54,901","00:03:57,439",Those must be comfortable shoes.
tt0109830,"00:03:58,822","00:04:03,487",I'll bet you could walk all day in shoes like that and not feel a thing.
tt0109830,"00:04:05,704","00:04:08,162",I wish I had shoes like that.
tt0109830,"00:04:08,832","00:04:10,368",My feet hurt.
tt0109830,"00:04:11,585","00:04:13,247",Mama always said there's an awful lot
tt0109830,"00:04:13,336","00:04:16,545",you could tell about a person by their shoes:
tt0109830,"00:04:17,674","00:04:20,633","where they're going, where they've been."
tt0109830,"00:04:27,893","00:04:29,930",I've worn lots of shoes.
tt0109830,"00:04:33,064","00:04:37,855","I bet if I think about it real hard, I could remember my first pair of shoes."
tt0109830,"00:04:40,781","00:04:43,398",Mama said they'd take me anywhere.
tt0109830,"00:04:44,201","00:04:46,818",<i>She said they was my magic shoes.</i>
tt0109830,"00:04:46,912","00:04:50,076","All right, Forrest, you can open your eyes now."
tt0109830,"00:04:57,380","00:04:59,838",Let's take a little walk around.
tt0109830,"00:05:06,640","00:05:08,427",How do those feel?
tt0109830,"00:05:11,394","00:05:13,556","His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,"
tt0109830,"00:05:13,647","00:05:16,139","as strong as I've ever seen,"
tt0109830,"00:05:16,233","00:05:19,601",but his back is as crooked as a politician.
tt0109830,"00:05:20,904","00:05:23,988","But we're gonna straighten him right up, now, aren't we, Forrest?"
tt0109830,"00:05:24,074","00:05:25,190",Forrest!
tt0109830,"00:05:26,701","00:05:27,908","<i>Now, when I was a baby,</i>"
tt0109830,"00:05:27,994","00:05:30,828","<i>Mama named me after the great Civil War hero,</i>"
tt0109830,"00:05:30,914","00:05:33,327",<i>General Nathan Bedford Forrest.</i>
tt0109830,"00:05:33,416","00:05:35,624",<i>She said we was related to him in some way.</i>
tt0109830,"00:05:35,710","00:05:37,076","<i>And what he did was,</i>"
tt0109830,"00:05:37,170","00:05:41,414",<i>he started up this club called the Ku Klux Klan.</i>
tt0109830,"00:05:41,508","00:05:44,842",<i>They'd all dress up in theirrobes and their bed sheets</i>
tt0109830,"00:05:44,928","00:05:49,263",<i>and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something.</i>
tt0109830,"00:05:49,349","00:05:53,218",<i>They'd even put bed sheets on their horses and ride around.</i>
tt0109830,"00:05:53,311","00:05:56,349","<i>And anyway, that's how I got my name,</i>"
tt0109830,"00:05:56,439","00:05:57,850",<i>Forrest Gump.</i>
tt0109830,"00:05:57,941","00:05:59,682","<i>Mama said that the ""Forrest"" part</i>"
tt0109830,"00:05:59,776","00:06:03,315","<i>was to remind me that sometimes we all do things that,</i>"
tt0109830,"00:06:03,405","00:06:06,193","<i>well, just don't make no sense.</i>"
tt0109830,"00:06:11,872","00:06:15,365","Okay... Get it, get it..."
tt0109830,"00:06:15,458","00:06:18,417","Wait, is it this way? Hold on."
tt0109830,"00:06:19,337","00:06:20,828",All right...
tt0109830,"00:06:21,423","00:06:23,085",What are you all staring at?
tt0109830,"00:06:23,174","00:06:27,635",Haven't you ever seen a little boy with braces on his legs before?
tt0109830,"00:06:29,180","00:06:32,890","Don't ever let anybody tell you they're better than you, Forrest."
tt0109830,"00:06:32,976","00:06:35,559","If God intended everybody to be the same,"
tt0109830,"00:06:35,645","00:06:37,762",he'd have given us all braces on our legs.
tt0109830,"00:06:37,856","00:06:41,645",<i>Mama always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them.</i>
tt0109830,"00:06:43,111","00:06:46,604","<i>We lived about a quarter mile off Route 17,</i>"
tt0109830,"00:06:46,698","00:06:49,736","<i>about a half mile from the town of Greenbow, Alabama.</i>"
tt0109830,"00:06:49,826","00:06:52,569",<i>That's in the county of Greenbow.</i>
tt0109830,"00:06:52,662","00:06:57,077",<i>Our house had been in Mama's family since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa</i>
tt0109830,"00:06:57,167","00:06:59,079","<i>had come across the ocean about 1,000 years ago,</i>"
tt0109830,"00:06:59,169","00:07:01,081",<i>something like that.</i>
tt0109830,"00:07:01,171","00:07:03,879","<i>Since it was just me and Mama and we had all these empty rooms,</i>"
tt0109830,"00:07:03,965","00:07:06,708","<i>Mama decided to let those rooms out,</i>"
tt0109830,"00:07:06,801","00:07:08,758","<i>mostly to people passing through,</i>"
tt0109830,"00:07:08,845","00:07:12,805","<i>like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery, places like that.</i>"
tt0109830,"00:07:12,891","00:07:15,599",<i>That's how me and Mama got money.</i>
tt0109830,"00:07:15,685","00:07:18,428",<i>Mama was a real smart lady.</i>
tt0109830,"00:07:18,521","00:07:23,516","Remember what I told you, Forrest. You're no different than anybody else is."
tt0109830,"00:07:26,029","00:07:28,396","Did you hear what I said, Forrest?"
tt0109830,"00:07:28,490","00:07:32,655",You're the same as everybody else. You are no different.
tt0109830,"00:07:33,161","00:07:37,622","Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump."
tt0109830,"00:07:37,707","00:07:39,915","Now, his IQ is 75."
tt0109830,"00:07:40,710","00:07:43,828","Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock."
tt0109830,"00:07:47,425","00:07:49,462","<i>She wanted me to have the finest education,</i>"
tt0109830,"00:07:49,552","00:07:53,466",<i>so she took me to the Greenbow County Central School.</i>
tt0109830,"00:07:53,556","00:07:55,798",<i>I met the principal and all.</i>
tt0109830,"00:07:56,309","00:07:59,177","I want to show you something, Mrs. Gump."
tt0109830,"00:07:59,646","00:08:02,514","Now, this is normal."
tt0109830,"00:08:03,024","00:08:06,313",Forrest is right here.
tt0109830,"00:08:07,153","00:08:12,694","The state requires a minimum IQ of 80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump."
tt0109830,"00:08:13,201","00:08:16,069",He's gonna have to go to a special school.
tt0109830,"00:08:16,162","00:08:18,279","Now, he'll be just fine."
tt0109830,"00:08:19,082","00:08:21,165","What does ""normal"" mean, anyway?"
tt0109830,"00:08:21,251","00:08:24,619","He might be a bit on the slow side,"
tt0109830,"00:08:25,755","00:08:27,496",but my boy Forrest is gonna get
tt0109830,"00:08:27,590","00:08:30,128",the same opportunities as everyone else.
tt0109830,"00:08:30,218","00:08:34,007",He's not going to some special school to learn how to re-tread tires.
tt0109830,"00:08:34,097","00:08:37,261",We're talking about five little points here.
tt0109830,"00:08:38,977","00:08:41,594",There must be something can be done.
tt0109830,"00:08:43,189","00:08:45,647",We're a progressive school system.
tt0109830,"00:08:46,484","00:08:49,397",We don't want to see anybody left behind.
tt0109830,"00:08:50,280","00:08:53,739","Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?"
tt0109830,"00:08:56,995","00:08:58,861",He's on vacation.
tt0109830,"00:09:16,347","00:09:20,136","Well, your mama sure does care about your schooling, son."

tt0109830,"00:09:39,621","00:09:41,578","""Finally, he had to try."
tt0109830,"00:09:41,664","00:09:43,621","""It looked easy, but,"

tt0109830,"00:09:56,012","00:09:58,720",Vacation's when you go somewhere
tt0109830,"00:10:01,101","00:10:03,434",and you don't ever come back.
tt0109830,"00:10:07,774","00:10:11,563","<i>Anyway, I guess you could say me and Mama was on our own.</i>"
tt0109830,"00:10:12,779","00:10:16,398",<i>But we didn't mind. Our house was never empty.</i>

tt0109830,"00:10:20,328","00:10:23,742","- It's supper, everyone. Forrest... - My, my. That sure looks special."

tt0109830,"00:10:26,459","00:10:29,122",<i>that every room was filled with travelers.</i>

tt0109830,"00:10:32,924","00:10:35,883",<i>and hat cases and sample cases.</i>
tt0109830,"00:10:35,969","00:10:39,383","Forrest Gump, it's suppertime! Forrest..."
tt0109830,"00:10:39,472","00:10:42,010","<i>One time, a young man was staying with us,</i>"
tt0109830,"00:10:42,100","00:10:45,719",<i>and he had him a guitar case.</i>
tt0109830,"00:10:59,701","00:11:03,695",Forrest! I told you not to bother this nice young man.
tt0109830,"00:11:03,788","00:11:05,120","Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am."
tt0109830,"00:11:05,206","00:11:08,040",I was just showing him a thing or two on the guitar here.
tt0109830,"00:11:08,126","00:11:11,085","All right, but your supper's ready if y'all want to eat."
tt0109830,"00:11:11,171","00:11:14,130","Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you, ma'am."
tt0109830,"00:11:14,799","00:11:18,383","Say, man, show me that crazy little walk you just did there."
tt0109830,"00:11:18,469","00:11:20,335",Slow it down some.
tt0109830,"00:11:22,473","00:11:24,385",<i>I liked that guitar.</i>

tt0109830,"00:11:56,925","00:11:59,759",This is not for children's eyes.

tt0109830,"00:12:13,441","00:12:15,603",Must be hard being a king.

tt0109830,"00:33:13,241","00:33:16,234","Matter of fact, I'm going into the shrimping business for myself"
tt0109830,"00:33:16,369","00:33:18,702",after I get out the Army.
tt0109830,"00:33:21,374","00:33:22,410",Okay.
tt0109830,"00:33:22,626","00:33:26,711",Gump! What's your sole purpose in this Army?
tt0109830,"00:33:26,796","00:33:29,334","To do whatever you tell me, Drill Sergeant!"
tt0109830,"00:33:29,424","00:33:32,792","God damn it, Gump! You're a goddamn genius!"
tt0109830,"00:33:32,928","00:33:35,261",That's the most outstanding answer I've ever heard.
tt0109830,"00:33:35,388","00:33:38,131",You must have a goddamn IQ of 160!
tt0109830,"00:33:38,266","00:33:41,225","You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump!"
tt0109830,"00:33:42,229","00:33:44,095","Listen up, people!"
tt0109830,"00:33:44,231","00:33:48,396","<i>Now, for some reason, I fit in the Army like one of them round pegs.</i>"
tt0109830,"00:33:48,485","00:33:49,726",<i>It's not really hard.</i>
tt0109830,"00:33:49,819","00:33:53,438","<i>You just make your bed real neat and remember to stand up straight,</i>"
tt0109830,"00:33:53,573","00:33:57,533","<i>and always answer every question with, ""Yes, Drill Sergeant!""</i>"
tt0109830,"00:33:57,619","00:33:59,076",Is that clear?
tt0109830,"00:33:59,162","00:34:01,279","- Yes, Drill Sergeant! - Yes, Drill Sergeant!"
tt0109830,"00:34:01,790","00:34:05,079","What you do is, you just drag your nets along the bottom."
tt0109830,"00:34:05,168","00:34:08,912","On a good day, you can catch over 100 pounds of shrimp."
tt0109830,"00:34:09,005","00:34:12,419","If everything goes all right, two men shrimping 10 hours,"
tt0109830,"00:34:12,509","00:34:15,217","less what you spend on gas, you can..."
tt0109830,"00:34:15,303","00:34:18,091","- Done, Drill Sergeant! - Gump!"
tt0109830,"00:34:20,475","00:34:23,218","Why did you put that weapon together so quickly, Gump?"
tt0109830,"00:34:23,311","00:34:24,973","You told me to, Drill Sergeant."
tt0109830,"00:34:25,105","00:34:28,519","Jesus H. Christ, this is a new company record."
tt0109830,"00:34:28,650","00:34:31,108","If it wouldn't be a waste of such a damn fine enlisted man,"
tt0109830,"00:34:31,194","00:34:33,481","I'd recommend you for OCS, Private Gump."
tt0109830,"00:34:33,613","00:34:35,445","You are gonna be a general some day, Gump."
tt0109830,"00:34:35,532","00:34:38,616","Now, disassemble your weapon and continue!"
tt0109830,"00:34:40,704","00:34:44,493","Anyway, like I was saying, shrimp is the fruit of the sea."
tt0109830,"00:34:44,583","00:34:49,328","You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it."
tt0109830,"00:34:49,421","00:34:52,414","There's shrimp kebabs, shrimp Creole..."
tt0109830,"00:34:52,716","00:34:57,552","...shrimp gumbo, pan fried, deep fried, stir fried."
tt0109830,"00:34:57,887","00:35:01,426","There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp,"
tt0109830,"00:35:01,516","00:35:03,849","coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp..."
tt0109830,"00:35:04,185","00:35:10,147","...shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes,"
tt0109830,"00:35:10,233","00:35:13,271","shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich..."
tt0109830,"00:35:15,864","00:35:18,197",That's... That's about it.
tt0109830,"00:35:21,911","00:35:24,870",<i>Night time in the Army is a lonely time.</i>
tt0109830,"00:35:25,749","00:35:29,368",<i>We'd lay there in our bunks and I'd miss my mama.</i>
tt0109830,"00:35:29,961","00:35:32,453",<i>And I'd miss Jenny.</i>
tt0109830,"00:35:36,384","00:35:40,253","Hey, Gump, get a load of the tits on her!"
tt0109830,"00:35:53,735","00:35:56,853","<i>Turns out, Jenny had gotten into some trouble over</i>"
tt0109830,"00:35:56,946","00:36:00,280","<i>some photos of her in her college sweater,</i>"
tt0109830,"00:36:00,408","00:36:02,946",<i>and she was thrown out of school.</i>
tt0109830,"00:36:06,498","00:36:08,706","<i>But that wasn't a bad thing,</i>"
tt0109830,"00:36:08,792","00:36:12,376","<i>because a man who owns a theater in Memphis, Tennessee,</i>"
tt0109830,"00:36:12,462","00:36:17,503",<i>saw those photos and offered Jenny a job singing in a show.</i>
tt0109830,"00:36:18,301","00:36:20,133","<i>The first chance I got,</i>"
tt0109830,"00:36:20,261","00:36:23,925",<i>I took the bus up to Memphis to see her perform in that show.</i>
tt0109830,"00:36:24,015","00:36:25,506","<i>That was Amber, Amber Flame.</i>"
tt0109830,"00:36:25,600","00:36:28,058","<i>Give her a big hand, guys. Good job, Amber.</i>"
tt0109830,"00:36:28,144","00:36:30,887","<i>And now, for your listening and viewing pleasure,</i>"

tt0109830,"00:37:30,331","00:37:32,869","Hey, honey, I got something here for you."
tt0109830,"00:37:33,918","00:37:37,662",- God damn it! - Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk!
tt0109830,"00:37:37,756","00:37:40,214",I'm singing a song here.

tt0109830,"00:37:45,054","00:37:46,761","- Shut up, there! - Don't be so shy, honey."
tt0109830,"00:37:46,848","00:37:48,384","Oh, shut up!"
tt0109830,"00:37:51,060","00:37:53,803","Forrest, what are you doing here?"
tt0109830,"00:37:53,897","00:37:55,604",- What are you doing? - Hey!

tt0109830,"00:37:57,192","00:37:59,184","Forrest, let me down!"
tt0109830,"00:38:05,033","00:38:06,945","You can't keep doing this, Forrest."
tt0109830,"00:38:07,035","00:38:09,118",You can't keep trying to rescue me all the time.

tt0109830,"00:38:14,209","00:38:17,373",Just... You can't keep doing this all the time.
tt0109830,"00:38:17,879","00:38:20,792",I can't help it. I love you.
tt0109830,"00:38:21,758","00:38:25,251","Forrest, you don't know what love is."
tt0109830,"00:38:32,560","00:38:35,553","You remember that time we prayed, Forrest?"
tt0109830,"00:38:36,439","00:38:40,934","We prayed for God to turn me into a bird so I could fly far, far away?"
tt0109830,"00:38:42,904","00:38:44,270","Yes, I do."
tt0109830,"00:38:48,243","00:38:51,077",You think I could fly off this bridge?
tt0109830,"00:38:57,752","00:38:59,914","What do you mean, Jenny?"
tt0109830,"00:39:03,800","00:39:05,291",Nothing.
tt0109830,"00:39:08,263","00:39:10,300",I gotta get out of here.
tt0109830,"00:39:12,600","00:39:13,681","Wait, Jenny..."

tt0109830,"00:39:32,203","00:39:34,616",It's this whole other country.
tt0109830,"00:39:37,125","00:39:39,117",Just hang on a minute.
tt0109830,"00:39:40,545","00:39:43,583","Listen, you promise me something, okay?"
tt0109830,"00:39:43,673","00:39:47,007","Just, if you're ever in trouble, don't try to be brave. You just run, okay?"
tt0109830,"00:39:47,135","00:39:48,717",Just run away.
tt0109830,"00:39:49,971","00:39:51,303",Okay.
tt0109830,"00:39:56,185","00:39:57,517",Jenny.
tt0109830,"00:39:59,397","00:40:01,684",I'll write you all the time.
tt0109830,"00:40:10,825","00:40:13,818","<i>And just like that, she was gone.</i>"
tt0109830,"00:40:29,928","00:40:33,262","You come back safe to me, do you hear?"
tt0109830,"00:41:16,557","00:41:20,517","<i>Now, they told us that Vietnam was gonna be very different</i>"

tt0109830,"00:41:23,564","00:41:28,605","<i>And except for all the beer cans and the barbecue, it was.</i>"
tt0109830,"00:41:38,746","00:41:41,830","Hey, I bet there's shrimp all in these waters."
tt0109830,"00:41:41,916","00:41:45,080",They tell me these Vietnams is good shrimpers.
tt0109830,"00:41:45,169","00:41:48,708","You know, after we win this war, and we take over everything,"
tt0109830,"00:41:48,798","00:41:50,005",we can get American shrimpers
tt0109830,"00:41:50,091","00:41:51,832",to come out here and shrimp these waters.
tt0109830,"00:41:51,926","00:41:53,462","We'll just shrimp all the time, man."
tt0109830,"00:41:53,594","00:41:56,758","So much shrimp, why, you wouldn't believe it."
tt0109830,"00:41:57,432","00:41:59,344",You must be my FNGs.
tt0109830,"00:41:59,434","00:42:00,675","- Morning, sir! - Morning, sir!"
tt0109830,"00:42:00,768","00:42:03,385",Get your hands down! Do not salute me.
tt0109830,"00:42:03,479","00:42:05,596",There's goddamn snipers all around this area
tt0109830,"00:42:05,690","00:42:08,524",who would love to grease an officer.
tt0109830,"00:42:08,609","00:42:12,102",I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor. Welcome to Fourth Platoon.
tt0109830,"00:42:12,989","00:42:15,402",What's wrong with your lip?
tt0109830,"00:42:15,491","00:42:17,858","I was born with big gums, sir."
tt0109830,"00:42:17,952","00:42:22,663","Yeah, well, you better tuck that in. Gonna get that caught on a trip wire."
tt0109830,"00:42:23,833","00:42:25,199",Where you boys from in the world?
tt0109830,"00:42:25,293","00:42:27,660","- Alabama, sir! - Alabama, sir!"
tt0109830,"00:42:28,379","00:42:29,870",You twins?
tt0109830,"00:42:31,966","00:42:34,379","No, we are not relations, sir."
tt0109830,"00:42:36,637","00:42:39,550","Look, it's pretty basic here."
tt0109830,"00:42:40,349","00:42:42,807",If you stick with me and learn from the guys
tt0109830,"00:42:42,894","00:42:45,557","who've been in country a while, you'll be all right."
tt0109830,"00:42:45,646","00:42:47,558",There is one item of GI gear
tt0109830,"00:42:47,648","00:42:51,813",that can be the difference between a live grunt and a dead grunt.
tt0109830,"00:42:52,153","00:42:55,317","Socks. Cushion sole, OD green."
tt0109830,"00:42:55,406","00:42:56,692",Try and keep your feet dry.
tt0109830,"00:42:56,824","00:42:58,302","When we're out humping, I want you boys to remember"
tt0109830,"00:42:58,326","00:43:00,784",to change your socks whenever we stop.
tt0109830,"00:43:00,870","00:43:03,829",The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet right off his legs.
tt0109830,"00:43:03,915","00:43:06,202","Sergeant Sims, God damn it,"
tt0109830,"00:43:06,334","00:43:07,811",where is that sling rope I told you to order?
tt0109830,"00:43:07,835","00:43:09,747",I put in the requisitions at Battalion.
tt0109830,"00:43:09,837","00:43:11,899","Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, you call those sons of bitches again..."
tt0109830,"00:43:11,923","00:43:16,839",<i>Lieutenant Dan sure knew his stuff. I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.</i>
tt0109830,"00:43:17,595","00:43:21,054","<i>He was from a long, great military tradition.</i>"
tt0109830,"00:43:21,265","00:43:24,349",<i>Somebody in his family had fought and died</i>
tt0109830,"00:43:25,353","00:43:29,597",<i>in every single American war.</i>
tt0109830,"00:43:30,525","00:43:32,586","- God damn it, kick some ass! - I'm on it, Lieutenant."
tt0109830,"00:43:32,610","00:43:33,726",Get on it!
tt0109830,"00:43:33,861","00:43:37,195",<i>I guess you could say he had a lot to live up to.</i>
tt0109830,"00:43:38,908","00:43:43,744","So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh? Well, I've been through there."
tt0109830,"00:43:43,871","00:43:46,033",Little Rock's a fine town.
tt0109830,"00:43:46,707","00:43:50,291","Now, go shake down your gear, see the platoon sergeant,"
tt0109830,"00:43:50,378","00:43:52,836",draw what you need for the field.
tt0109830,"00:43:52,922","00:43:56,882","If you boys are hungry, we got steaks burning right over here."
tt0109830,"00:43:56,968","00:43:59,836",Two standing orders in this platoon:
tt0109830,"00:43:59,929","00:44:02,592","one, take good care of your feet,"
tt0109830,"00:44:02,723","00:44:07,764","two, try not to do anything stupid, like getting yourself killed."
tt0109830,"00:44:14,235","00:44:16,318",I sure hope I don't let him down.
tt0109830,"00:44:27,915","00:44:32,831",<i>I got to see a lot of the countryside. We would take these real long walks.</i>
tt0109830,"00:44:41,304","00:44:45,423",<i>And we were always looking for this guy named Charlie.</i>
tt0109830,"00:44:53,274","00:44:55,516","- Hold it up! - Hold up, boys!"
tt0109830,"00:44:58,362","00:45:00,695",<i>It wasn't always fun.</i>
tt0109830,"00:45:00,781","00:45:05,071","<i>Lieutenant Dan was always getting these funny feelings about a rock,</i>"
tt0109830,"00:45:05,161","00:45:10,247","<i>or a trail, or the road, so he'd tell us to get down, shut up...</i>"
tt0109830,"00:45:10,333","00:45:12,325",Get down! Shut up!
tt0109830,"00:45:13,294","00:45:14,751",<i>...so we did.</i>
tt0109830,"00:45:32,313","00:45:34,475","<i>Now, I don't know much about anything,</i>"
tt0109830,"00:45:34,565","00:45:38,400",<i>but I think some of America's best young men served in this war.</i>
tt0109830,"00:45:38,486","00:45:41,194","<i>There was Dallas, from Phoenix,</i>"
tt0109830,"00:45:42,907","00:45:45,695","<i>Cleveland, he was from Detroit.</i>"
tt0109830,"00:45:45,826","00:45:48,193","Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex."

tt0109830,"00:58:53,530","00:58:55,863","Now, the secret to this game is,"
tt0109830,"00:58:55,949","00:59:01,786","no matter what happens, never ever take your eye off the ball."
tt0109830,"00:59:05,375","00:59:06,707",All right.
tt0109830,"00:59:10,047","00:59:13,711","<i>For some reason, Ping-Pong came very natural to me.</i>"
tt0109830,"00:59:14,051","00:59:16,964",See? Any idiot can play.
tt0109830,"00:59:17,471","00:59:20,214","<i>So, I started playing it all the time.</i>"
tt0109830,"00:59:21,391","00:59:22,723",<i>I played Ping-Pong</i>
tt0109830,"00:59:22,809","00:59:26,098",<i>even when I didn't have anyone to play Ping-Pong with.</i>
tt0109830,"00:59:34,154","00:59:38,819","<i>The hospital's people said it made me look like a duck in water,</i>"
tt0109830,"00:59:38,950","00:59:40,782",<i>whatever that means.</i>
tt0109830,"00:59:41,244","00:59:44,487",<i>Even Lieutenant Dan would come and watch me play.</i>
tt0109830,"00:59:50,003","00:59:53,872","<i>I played Ping-Pong so much, I even played it in my sleep.</i>"

tt0109830,"01:00:06,853","01:00:09,891","Nothing just happens, it's all part of a plan."
tt0109830,"01:00:10,023","01:00:12,686","I should have died out there with my men,"
tt0109830,"01:00:12,818","01:00:16,778","but now I'm nothing but a goddamn cripple,"

tt0109830,"01:00:29,543","01:00:31,159","Yes, sir, I do."
tt0109830,"01:00:34,840","01:00:36,877",Did you hear what I said?
tt0109830,"01:00:37,759","01:00:39,500",You cheated me.
tt0109830,"01:00:39,594","01:00:40,755",I had a destiny.

tt0109830,"01:00:45,058","01:00:49,098","That was my destiny, and you cheated me out of it!"

tt0109830,"01:01:03,577","01:01:06,945","This wasn't supposed to happen, not to me."
tt0109830,"01:01:09,583","01:01:11,245",I had a destiny.
tt0109830,"01:01:13,211","01:01:17,581",I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.

tt0109830,"01:01:49,331","01:01:50,822",Look at me.
tt0109830,"01:01:52,167","01:01:54,124",What am I gonna do now?
tt0109830,"01:01:57,797","01:01:59,834",What am I gonna do now?
tt0109830,"01:02:10,227","01:02:11,684",PFC Gump?

tt0109830,"01:02:15,315","01:02:16,806",As you were.
tt0109830,"01:02:17,317","01:02:21,152","Son, you've been awarded the Medal of Honor."
tt0109830,"01:02:22,197","01:02:25,816","Guess what, Lieutenant Dan, they want to give me a..."
tt0109830,"01:02:32,582","01:02:36,326","Ma'am, what'd they do with Lieutenant Dan?"
tt0109830,"01:02:37,254","01:02:39,041",They sent him home.
tt0109830,"01:02:45,053","01:02:47,796","<i>Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.</i>"

tt0109830,"01:03:12,622","01:03:14,909",<i>I'd kind of like to see that.</i>
tt0109830,"01:03:29,055","01:03:30,512","<i>God damn, son.</i>"
tt0109830,"01:03:32,642","01:03:36,477","<i>After that, Mama went to the hotel to lay down,</i>"

tt0109830,"01:26:54,501","01:26:56,037","<i>So, I went on down to Bayou La Batre</i>"

tt0109830,"01:28:14,790","01:28:16,531",and a brand-new shrimping boat.

tt0109830,"01:42:18,424","01:42:21,792","<i>Now, Mama said there's only so much fortune a man really needs,</i>"
tt0109830,"01:42:23,054","01:42:25,922",<i>and the rest is just for showing off.</i>
tt0109830,"01:42:26,015","01:42:29,884","<i>So, I gave a whole bunch of it to the Foursquare gospel church,</i>"
tt0109830,"01:42:32,563","01:42:37,058",<i>and I gave a whole bunch to the Bayou La Batre fishing hospital.</i>
tt0109830,"01:42:39,403","01:42:43,943","<i>And even though Bubba was dead and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,</i>"
tt0109830,"01:42:44,075","01:42:46,692",<i>I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.</i>

tt0109830,"01:45:29,907","01:45:32,194",<i>It was wonderful having her home.</i>

tt0109830,"02:00:42,110","02:00:43,726",There you are.
tt0109830,"02:00:45,488","02:00:46,608","And this, I got you running."
tt0109830,"02:00:49,659","02:00:51,821","I ran a long way,"
tt0109830,"02:00:52,328","02:00:54,160",for a long time.
tt0109830,"02:00:56,374","02:00:57,865",And there...
tt0109830,"02:01:04,382","02:01:07,841","Listen, Forrest, I don't know how to say this."
tt0109830,"02:01:10,346","02:01:14,681","I just I want to apologize for anything that I ever did to you,"
tt0109830,"02:01:14,809","02:01:20,055","'cause I was messed up for a long time, and..."

tt0109830,"02:01:40,543","02:01:43,286","This is my very good friend, Mr. Gump. Can you say hi to him?"

tt0109830,"02:01:58,603","02:02:00,435",His name's Forrest.
tt0109830,"02:02:01,564","02:02:02,896",Like me.
tt0109830,"02:02:04,526","02:02:06,643",I named him after his daddy.
tt0109830,"02:02:07,612","02:02:10,070","He got a daddy named Forrest, too?"
tt0109830,"02:02:11,366","02:02:13,403","You're his daddy, Forrest."
tt0109830,"02:02:27,882","02:02:29,089",Hey.
tt0109830,"02:02:30,260","02:02:33,128","Forrest, look at me. Look at me, Forrest."

tt0109830,"02:02:40,395","02:02:41,761",Okay?
tt0109830,"02:02:46,109","02:02:47,975",Isn't he beautiful?
tt0109830,"02:02:48,987","02:02:51,946",He's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

tt0109830,"02:03:03,459","02:03:07,453",He's very smart. He's one of the smartest in his class.
tt0109830,"02:03:16,806","02:03:19,264","Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him."
tt0109830,"02:03:28,610","02:03:31,444",#NAME?

tt0109830,"02:03:57,805","02:03:59,341",I'm sick.
tt0109830,"02:04:02,018","02:04:05,637","What, do you have a cough due to a cold?"
tt0109830,"02:04:05,730","02:04:08,097","I have some kind of virus,"
tt0109830,"02:04:08,191","02:04:10,899","and the doctors don't... They don't know what it is,"
tt0109830,"02:04:11,027","02:04:14,020",and there isn't anything they can do about it.
tt0109830,"02:04:18,409","02:04:20,696",You could come home with me.
tt0109830,"02:04:22,372","02:04:28,039","Jenny, you and little Forrest could come stay at my house in Greenbow."
tt0109830,"02:04:32,382","02:04:35,170",I'll take care of you if you're sick.
tt0109830,"02:04:37,553","02:04:39,840","Would you marry me, Forrest?"
tt0109830,"02:04:45,103","02:04:46,344",Okay.

tt0109830,"02:05:17,093","02:05:18,584",Your tie.
tt0109830,"02:05:31,149","02:05:32,765",Lieutenant Dan.
tt0109830,"02:05:48,124","02:05:50,081",Lieutenant Dan.
tt0109830,"02:05:50,918","02:05:52,580","Hello, Forrest."
tt0109830,"02:05:53,254","02:05:55,917",You got new legs. New legs!
tt0109830,"02:05:57,133","02:06:00,922",Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.
tt0109830,"02:06:01,637","02:06:05,631",Titanium alloy. It's what they use on the space shuttle.
tt0109830,"02:06:09,479","02:06:10,970",Magic legs.
tt0109830,"02:06:12,982","02:06:17,352","This is my fiancée, Susan."

tt0109830,"02:06:29,207","02:06:32,200",Hey. It's nice to meet you finally.
tt0109830,"02:06:42,345","02:06:46,510","Do you, Forrest, take Jenny to be your wife?"
tt0109830,"02:06:48,392","02:06:52,636","Do you, Jenny, take Forrest to be your husband?"
tt0109830,"02:06:53,981","02:06:57,349",And so I pronounce you man and wife.

tt0109830,"02:07:43,781","02:07:45,568","Hey, Forrest."
tt0109830,"02:07:50,913","02:07:52,700",Were you scared in Vietnam?
tt0109830,"02:07:54,375","02:07:56,708","Yes. Well, I..."
tt0109830,"02:07:58,045","02:07:59,752",I don't know.
tt0109830,"02:08:00,464","02:08:05,425",<i>Sometimes it would stop raining long enough for the stars to come out.</i>
tt0109830,"02:08:08,556","02:08:10,593",<i>And then it was nice.</i>
tt0109830,"02:08:13,978","02:08:17,938",It was like just before the sun goes to bed down on the bayou.
tt0109830,"02:08:19,233","02:08:23,102",<i>There was always a million sparkles on the water.</i>
tt0109830,"02:08:24,906","02:08:28,820","<i>Like that mountain lake. It was so clear, Jenny,</i>"
tt0109830,"02:08:28,951","02:08:33,537","<i>it looked like there were two skies, one on top of the other.</i>"
tt0109830,"02:08:36,083","02:08:39,121","And then, in the desert, when the sun comes up,"
tt0109830,"02:08:41,589","02:08:45,754",<i>I couldn't tell where heaven stopped</i>
tt0109830,"02:08:46,302","02:08:48,669",<i>and the earth began.</i>
tt0109830,"02:08:49,931","02:08:51,797",<i>It was so beautiful.</i>
tt0109830,"02:08:56,520","02:08:59,604",I wish I could've been there with you.
tt0109830,"02:09:02,693","02:09:04,104",You were.
tt0109830,"02:09:14,830","02:09:16,287",I love you.
tt0109830,"02:09:20,670","02:09:24,004",<i>You died on a Saturday morning.</i>
tt0109830,"02:09:25,716","02:09:29,460",And I had you placed here under our tree.
tt0109830,"02:09:34,350","02:09:39,186",And I had that house of your father's bulldozed to the ground.
tt0109830,"02:09:43,317","02:09:44,979",<i>Mama</i>
tt0109830,"02:09:46,070","02:09:51,065",always said that dying was a part of life.
tt0109830,"02:09:54,495","02:09:56,828",I sure wish it wasn't.
tt0109830,"02:09:59,500","02:10:03,244",Little Forrest is doing just fine.
tt0109830,"02:10:04,588","02:10:05,669",But...
tt0109830,"02:10:05,923","02:10:08,586","<i>About to start school again soon,</i>"
tt0109830,"02:10:10,428","02:10:14,217","and I make his breakfast, lunch and dinner every day."
tt0109830,"02:10:16,392","02:10:22,389",I make sure he combs his hair and brushes his teeth every day.
tt0109830,"02:10:25,526","02:10:28,109",Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.
tt0109830,"02:10:29,405","02:10:30,441",Okay.
tt0109830,"02:10:30,698","02:10:31,859",<i>He's really good.</i>
tt0109830,"02:10:31,949","02:10:34,066","Forrest, you go."
tt0109830,"02:10:38,289","02:10:39,871",<i>We fish a lot.</i>
tt0109830,"02:10:43,419","02:10:46,878","And every night, we read a book. He's so smart, Jenny."
tt0109830,"02:10:50,134","02:10:52,376",You'd be so proud of him.
tt0109830,"02:10:54,096","02:10:55,553",I am.
tt0109830,"02:10:56,599","02:10:59,808",He wrote you a letter.
tt0109830,"02:11:01,395","02:11:03,432",And he says I can't read it.
tt0109830,"02:11:03,564","02:11:07,103","I'm not supposed to, so I'll just leave it here for you."
tt0109830,"02:11:23,167","02:11:24,499","Jenny,"
tt0109830,"02:11:30,299","02:11:33,508","I don't know if Mama was right,"
tt0109830,"02:11:34,845","02:11:36,336",or if it's Lieutenant Dan.
tt0109830,"02:11:36,472","02:11:39,055",I don't know
tt0109830,"02:11:39,141","02:11:43,636","if we each have a destiny,"
tt0109830,"02:11:45,689","02:11:50,809",or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze.
tt0109830,"02:11:55,324","02:11:57,156",But I think
tt0109830,"02:11:59,036","02:12:00,823",maybe it's both.
tt0109830,"02:12:05,167","02:12:08,035",Maybe both is happening at the same time.
tt0109830,"02:12:14,176","02:12:16,168","But I miss you, Jenny."
tt0109830,"02:12:22,560","02:12:26,975","If there's anything you need, I won't be far away."
tt0109830,"02:13:02,266","02:13:05,225",Here's your bus. Okay.
tt0109830,"02:13:06,896","02:13:10,230",Hey. I know this.
tt0109830,"02:13:10,357","02:13:13,225",I'm gonna show that for show-and-tell because
tt0109830,"02:13:13,360","02:13:16,023",Grandma used to read it to you.
tt0109830,"02:13:16,113","02:13:18,230",My favorite book.
tt0109830,"02:13:21,577","02:13:23,068",Here we are.
tt0109830,"02:13:23,245","02:13:24,702",Okay.
tt0109830,"02:13:26,415","02:13:27,906",Here you go.
tt0109830,"02:13:32,796","02:13:35,288","Hey, Forrest, don't..."
tt0109830,"02:13:38,761","02:13:42,471",#NAME?
tt0109830,"02:13:44,475","02:13:47,263",I'll be right here when you get back.
tt0109830,"02:13:51,815","02:13:55,058","You understand this is the bus to school, now, don't you?"
tt0109830,"02:13:55,152","02:13:58,691","Of course, and you are Dorothy Harris, and I'm Forrest Gump."
tt1375666,"00:01:33,452","00:01:38,459",He was delirious. But asked for you by name.
tt1375666,"00:01:40,458","00:01:42,058",Show him.
tt1375666,"00:01:43,357","00:01:46,059",He was carrying nothing but this....
tt1375666,"00:01:47,462","00:01:49,062",... and this.
tt1375666,"00:02:10,104","00:02:12,834",Are you here to kill me?
tt1375666,"00:02:20,514","00:02:23,005",I know what this is.
tt1375666,"00:02:24,085","00:02:29,250","I've seen one before. Many, many years ago."
tt1375666,"00:02:30,858","00:02:35,761",It belonged to a man I met in a half-remembered dream.
tt1375666,"00:02:37,765","00:02:42,862",A man possessed of some radical notions.
tt1375666,"00:02:46,741","00:02:49,608",What is the most resilient parasite?
tt1375666,"00:02:49,877","00:02:53,244",A bacteria? A virus?
tt1375666,"00:02:53,814","00:02:55,076",An intestinal worm?
tt1375666,"00:02:55,416","00:02:56,644",Uh...
tt1375666,"00:02:56,817","00:02:58,444",What Mr. Cobb is trying to say-
tt1375666,"00:02:58,619","00:02:59,813",An idea.
tt1375666,"00:03:01,122","00:03:03,613",Resilient. Highly contagious.
tt1375666,"00:03:03,791","00:03:07,784","Once an idea has taken hold of the brain, it's almost impossible to eradicate."
tt1375666,"00:03:08,229","00:03:12,495","An idea that is fully formed, fully understood, that sticks."
tt1375666,"00:03:12,667","00:03:13,895",Right in there somewhere.
tt1375666,"00:03:14,068","00:03:15,626",For someone like you to steal?
tt1375666,"00:03:15,803","00:03:18,738","Yes. In the dream state, your conscious defenses are lowered..."
tt1375666,"00:03:18,906","00:03:21,340",...and that makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft.
tt1375666,"00:03:21,509","00:03:22,737",It's called extraction.
tt1375666,"00:03:22,910","00:03:26,471","Mr. Saito, we can train your subconscious to defend itself..."
tt1375666,"00:03:26,647","00:03:29,138",...from even the most skilled extractor.
tt1375666,"00:03:29,317","00:03:30,477",How can you do that?
tt1375666,"00:03:30,651","00:03:33,484",Because I am the most skilled extractor.
tt1375666,"00:03:33,955","00:03:37,356",I know how to search your mind and find your secrets. I know the tricks.
tt1375666,"00:03:37,525","00:03:40,460","And I can teach them to you, so that even when you're asleep..."
tt1375666,"00:03:40,628","00:03:42,960",...your defense is never down.
tt1375666,"00:03:43,864","00:03:47,766","Look, if you want my help, you're gonna have to be completely open with me."
tt1375666,"00:03:47,935","00:03:51,302",I need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife...
tt1375666,"00:03:51,472","00:03:53,770","...better than your therapist, better than anyone."
tt1375666,"00:03:54,208","00:03:56,870","If this is a dream, and you have a safe full of secrets..."
tt1375666,"00:03:57,044","00:03:59,376",...I need to know what's in that safe.
tt1375666,"00:03:59,547","00:04:03,005","In order for this all to work, you need to completely let me in."
tt1375666,"00:04:05,886","00:04:10,516","Enjoy your evening, gentlemen, as I consider your proposal."
tt1375666,"00:04:12,994","00:04:14,018",He knows.
tt1375666,"00:04:17,064","00:04:18,531",What's going on up there?
tt1375666,"00:05:12,787","00:05:15,381",Saito knows. He's playing with us.
tt1375666,"00:05:15,790","00:05:18,122",Doesn't matter. I can get it here. Trust me.
tt1375666,"00:05:18,292","00:05:19,782",The information is in the safe.
tt1375666,"00:05:19,960","00:05:22,121",He looked right at it when I mentioned secrets.
tt1375666,"00:05:23,497","00:05:24,521",What's she doing here?
tt1375666,"00:05:27,468","00:05:30,335",Just head back to the room. All right? I'll take care of this.
tt1375666,"00:05:30,504","00:05:32,529","Okay, make sure you do. We're here to work."
tt1375666,"00:05:40,981","00:05:45,645","If I jumped, would I survive?"
tt1375666,"00:05:48,022","00:05:50,422","With a clean dive, perhaps."
tt1375666,"00:05:50,591","00:05:52,252","Mal, what are you doing here?"
tt1375666,"00:05:52,426","00:05:54,621",I thought you might be missing me.
tt1375666,"00:05:54,929","00:05:56,055",You know that I am.
tt1375666,"00:05:57,631","00:06:00,099",But I can't trust you anymore.
tt1375666,"00:06:00,835","00:06:02,200",So what?
tt1375666,"00:06:03,771","00:06:05,966",Looks like Arthur's taste.
tt1375666,"00:06:06,140","00:06:09,769","Actually, the subject is partial to postwar British painters."
tt1375666,"00:06:11,479","00:06:13,174","Please, have a seat."
tt1375666,"00:06:20,921","00:06:22,354",Tell me...
tt1375666,"00:06:22,756","00:06:24,314",...do the children miss me?
tt1375666,"00:06:28,662","00:06:30,357",You can't imagine.
tt1375666,"00:06:34,535","00:06:35,627",What are you doing?
tt1375666,"00:06:35,803","00:06:37,327",Just getting some fresh air.
tt1375666,"00:06:37,738","00:06:39,501","Stay where you are, Mal."
tt1375666,"00:06:53,220","00:06:55,051",Goddamn it.
tt1375666,"00:07:56,917","00:07:58,475",Turn around.
tt1375666,"00:07:58,652","00:07:59,676","The gun, Dom."
tt1375666,"00:08:08,963","00:08:10,089",Please.
tt1375666,"00:08:22,209","00:08:24,575","Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb."
tt1375666,"00:08:24,979","00:08:28,380",Did she tell you? Or have you known all along?
tt1375666,"00:08:28,816","00:08:33,776","That you're here to steal from me, or that we are actually asleep?"
tt1375666,"00:08:37,925","00:08:40,291",I want to know the name of your employer.
tt1375666,"00:08:42,296","00:08:46,164","Ah, there's no use threatening him in a dream, right, Mal?"
tt1375666,"00:08:46,333","00:08:48,801",That depends on what you're threatening.
tt1375666,"00:08:49,703","00:08:51,864",Killing him would just wake him up.
tt1375666,"00:08:52,640","00:08:53,800",But pain...
tt1375666,"00:08:57,745","00:08:59,645",Pain is in the mind.
tt1375666,"00:09:00,347","00:09:04,545","And judging by the decor, we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?"
tt1375666,"00:09:15,963","00:09:19,057",- What are you doing? It's too soon. - But the dream's collapsing.
tt1375666,"00:09:19,233","00:09:22,669",I'm gonna try to keep Saito under a little bit longer. We're almost there.
tt1375666,"00:09:36,884","00:09:40,843",He was close. Very close.
tt1375666,"00:09:55,169","00:09:56,727",Stop him!
tt1375666,"00:10:22,563","00:10:24,724",This isn't gonna work. Wake him up.
tt1375666,"00:10:45,552","00:10:47,486",He won't wake.
tt1375666,"00:10:51,959","00:10:53,256",#NAME?
tt1375666,"00:10:53,794","00:10:54,818",Dunk him.
tt1375666,"00:11:39,373","00:11:40,738",He's out.
tt1375666,"00:11:46,046","00:11:48,105","You came prepared, hmm?"
tt1375666,"00:11:48,282","00:11:52,116",Not even my head of security knows this apartment. How did you find it?
tt1375666,"00:11:52,753","00:11:56,484",It's difficult for a man of your position to keep a love nest like this secret...
tt1375666,"00:11:56,657","00:11:59,182",...particularly where there's a married woman involved.
tt1375666,"00:11:59,359","00:12:01,327",#NAME?
tt1375666,"00:12:02,396","00:12:04,489",- With a dilemma. - They're getting closer.
tt1375666,"00:12:04,665","00:12:07,429","- You got what you came for. Well, that's not true."
tt1375666,"00:12:07,601","00:12:10,263","You left out a key piece of information, didn't you?"
tt1375666,"00:12:10,437","00:12:13,634",You held something back because you knew what we were up to.
tt1375666,"00:12:13,807","00:12:16,674","- Question is, why'd you let us in at all? - An audition."
tt1375666,"00:12:17,878","00:12:20,813",- An audition for what? - Doesn't matter. You failed.
tt1375666,"00:12:20,981","00:12:23,677",We extracted every bit of information you had in there.
tt1375666,"00:12:24,084","00:12:26,382",But your deception was obvious.
tt1375666,"00:13:07,261","00:13:11,698","- So leave me and go. - You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito."
tt1375666,"00:13:11,865","00:13:16,097","That corporation that hired us, they won't accept failure."
tt1375666,"00:13:16,270","00:13:18,397",We won't last two days.
tt1375666,"00:13:20,340","00:13:21,534",Cobb?
tt1375666,"00:13:21,708","00:13:24,836",Looks like I'm gonna have to do this a little more simply.
tt1375666,"00:13:25,012","00:13:28,778","Tell us what you know! Tell us what you know, now!"
tt1375666,"00:13:32,152","00:13:35,019",I've always hated this carpet.
tt1375666,"00:13:35,656","00:13:39,558",It's stained and frayed in such distinctive ways.
tt1375666,"00:13:41,061","00:13:44,394",But very definitely made of wool.
tt1375666,"00:13:45,232","00:13:46,927",Right now...
tt1375666,"00:13:47,968","00:13:50,402",...I'm lying on polyester.
tt1375666,"00:13:54,274","00:13:59,109","Which means I'm not lying on my carpet, in my apartment."
tt1375666,"00:13:59,980","00:14:03,245","You have lived up to your reputation, Mr. Cobb."
tt1375666,"00:14:03,684","00:14:05,709",I'm still dreaming.
tt1375666,"00:14:12,392","00:14:14,223",- How'd it go? - Not good.
tt1375666,"00:14:19,633","00:14:23,729","Dream within a dream, huh? I'm impressed."
tt1375666,"00:14:25,005","00:14:28,497","But in my dream, you play by my rules."
tt1375666,"00:14:28,675","00:14:30,939","Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito..."
tt1375666,"00:14:31,111","00:14:32,510",We're not in your dream.
tt1375666,"00:14:32,679","00:14:34,237",We're in mine.
tt1375666,"00:14:44,191","00:14:46,284",Asshole. How do you mess up the carpet?
tt1375666,"00:14:46,460","00:14:48,758",- It wasn't my fault. - You're the architect.
tt1375666,"00:14:48,929","00:14:51,056",I didn't know he was gonna rub his cheek on it!
tt1375666,"00:14:51,231","00:14:52,323",That's enough.
tt1375666,"00:14:53,433","00:14:54,957",You. What the hell was all that?
tt1375666,"00:14:55,469","00:14:58,336",- I have it under control. - I'd hate to see you out of control.
tt1375666,"00:14:58,505","00:15:02,271",We don't have time for this. I'm getting off at Kyoto.
tt1375666,"00:15:02,442","00:15:04,273",He's not gonna check every compartment.
tt1375666,"00:15:04,444","00:15:06,071","Yeah, well, I don't like trains."
tt1375666,"00:15:06,246","00:15:09,010",Listen. Every man for himself.
tt1375666,"00:16:23,356","00:16:24,380","Yes, hello?"
tt1375666,"00:16:24,591","00:16:27,185","Hi, Daddy. Hi, Dad."
tt1375666,"00:16:27,728","00:16:31,323","Hey, guys. Hey. How are you? How you doing, huh?"
tt1375666,"00:16:31,498","00:16:33,728","Good. Okay, I guess."
tt1375666,"00:16:33,900","00:16:37,631","Okay? Who's just okay? Is that you, James?"
tt1375666,"00:16:37,804","00:16:41,706","Yeah. When are you coming home, Dad?"
tt1375666,"00:16:42,709","00:16:47,339","Well, I can't, sweetheart. I can't. Not for a while, remember?"
tt1375666,"00:16:47,514","00:16:48,845",Why?
tt1375666,"00:16:49,182","00:16:54,745","Look, I told you, I'm away because I'm working, right?"
tt1375666,"00:16:55,055","00:16:57,888",Grandma says you're never coming back.
tt1375666,"00:16:58,558","00:17:00,458","Phillipa, is that you?"
tt1375666,"00:17:01,428","00:17:03,760","Put Grandma on the phone for me, will you?"
tt1375666,"00:17:03,930","00:17:05,625",She's shaking her head.
tt1375666,"00:17:07,768","00:17:10,259","Well, just hope she's wrong about that."
tt1375666,"00:17:11,138","00:17:12,332",Daddy?
tt1375666,"00:17:13,039","00:17:14,063","Yeah, James?"
tt1375666,"00:17:14,241","00:17:15,902",Is Mommy with you?
tt1375666,"00:17:18,545","00:17:20,740","James, we talked about this."
tt1375666,"00:17:22,048","00:17:24,380",Mommy's not here anymore.
tt1375666,"00:17:25,452","00:17:26,680",Where?
tt1375666,"00:17:28,421","00:17:31,049","That's enough, kids. Say bye-bye."
tt1375666,"00:17:31,224","00:17:34,250","Listen, I'm gonna send some presents with Grandpa, all right?"
tt1375666,"00:17:34,427","00:17:35,451","And you be good, you be-"
tt1375666,"00:17:45,972","00:17:48,167",- Our ride's on the roof. - Right.
tt1375666,"00:17:55,348","00:17:56,508","Hey, are you okay?"
tt1375666,"00:17:57,250","00:17:58,547","Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Why?"
tt1375666,"00:17:58,718","00:18:01,152","Well, down in the dream, Mal showing up."
tt1375666,"00:18:01,321","00:18:04,552","Look, I'm, uh, sorry about your leg. Won't happen again."
tt1375666,"00:18:04,724","00:18:08,319","- It's getting worse, isn't it? - One apology's all you're getting, all right?"
tt1375666,"00:18:08,495","00:18:10,963",- Where's Nash? - He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?
tt1375666,"00:18:11,131","00:18:13,599",We were supposed to deliver Saito's expansion plans...
tt1375666,"00:18:13,767","00:18:15,530",...to Cobol Engineering two hours ago.
tt1375666,"00:18:15,702","00:18:18,933","By now, they know we failed. It's time we disappear."

tt1375666,"00:18:22,142","00:18:26,408","I can lie low there, maybe sniff out a job when things quiet down. You?"
tt1375666,"00:18:26,580","00:18:27,774",Stateside.
tt1375666,"00:18:27,981","00:18:29,471",Send my regards.
tt1375666,"00:18:35,822","00:18:39,383",He sold you out. Thought to come to me and bargain for his life.
tt1375666,"00:18:41,561","00:18:43,358",So I offer you the satisfaction.
tt1375666,"00:18:47,300","00:18:49,825",It's not the way I deal with things.

tt1375666,"00:19:05,385","00:19:07,876",But I can't speak for Cobol Engineering.

tt1375666,"00:19:31,945","00:19:33,810",...why can't you plant one there instead?
tt1375666,"00:19:33,980","00:19:36,073","Okay, here's me planting an idea in your head."
tt1375666,"00:19:36,249","00:19:39,548","I say, ""Don't think about elephants."" What are you thinking about?"

tt1375666,"00:19:40,921","00:19:44,084","Right. But it's not your idea, because you know I gave it to you."
tt1375666,"00:19:44,291","00:19:47,260",The subject's mind can always trace the genesis of the idea.
tt1375666,"00:19:47,427","00:19:50,624",- True inspiration's impossible to fake. - That's not true.

tt1375666,"00:19:56,436","00:19:59,098",Because I can find my own way to square things with Cobol.
tt1375666,"00:19:59,272","00:20:01,297",Then you do have a choice.
tt1375666,"00:20:01,474","00:20:03,237","Then I choose to leave, sir."
tt1375666,"00:20:08,148","00:20:09,843",Tell the crew where you want to go.

tt1375666,"00:20:22,228","00:20:25,527",To America. To your children.

tt1375666,"00:21:52,218","00:21:54,049",I've done it before.

tt1375666,"00:22:48,675","00:22:51,269",It'll take more than the occasional stuffed animal...

tt1375666,"00:22:54,581","00:22:57,414",I'm just doing what I know. I'm doing what you taught me.
tt1375666,"00:22:57,584","00:22:59,108",I never taught you to be a thief.
tt1375666,"00:22:59,285","00:23:01,480","No, you taught me to navigate people's minds."
tt1375666,"00:23:01,654","00:23:02,951",But after what happened...
tt1375666,"00:23:03,123","00:23:06,684",...there weren't a whole lot of legitimate ways for me to use that skill.
tt1375666,"00:23:11,831","00:23:13,321","What are you doing here, Dom?"
tt1375666,"00:23:15,435","00:23:17,835",I think I found a way home.
tt1375666,"00:23:18,004","00:23:21,565","It's a job for some very, very powerful people."
tt1375666,"00:23:21,808","00:23:26,211",People who I believe can fix my charges permanently.
tt1375666,"00:23:27,013","00:23:28,275",But I need your help.
tt1375666,"00:23:28,982","00:23:32,281",You're here to corrupt one of my brightest and best.
tt1375666,"00:23:32,452","00:23:35,353",You know what I'm offering. Let them decide for themselves.
tt1375666,"00:23:35,522","00:23:36,989",#NAME?
tt1375666,"00:23:37,157","00:23:38,488",You remember.
tt1375666,"00:23:38,658","00:23:41,889","It's the chance to build cathedrals, entire cities..."
tt1375666,"00:23:42,061","00:23:43,824",...things that never existed...
tt1375666,"00:23:43,997","00:23:47,194",...things that couldn't exist in the real world.
tt1375666,"00:23:47,367","00:23:52,532",So you want me to let someone else follow you into your fantasy?
tt1375666,"00:23:52,705","00:23:54,673",They don't actually come into the dream.
tt1375666,"00:23:54,841","00:23:58,106",They just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.
tt1375666,"00:23:58,278","00:23:59,506",Design it yourself.
tt1375666,"00:24:02,182","00:24:03,672",Mal won't let me.
tt1375666,"00:24:09,889","00:24:12,016","Come back to reality, Dom."
tt1375666,"00:24:13,359","00:24:15,919",#NAME?
tt1375666,"00:24:16,296","00:24:18,821","Those kids, your grandchildren..."
tt1375666,"00:24:18,998","00:24:22,991",...they're waiting for their father to come back home. That's their reality.
tt1375666,"00:24:23,169","00:24:26,366","And this job, this last job, that's how I get there."
tt1375666,"00:24:26,906","00:24:30,535",I would not be standing here if I knew any other way.
tt1375666,"00:24:33,713","00:24:36,614",I need an architect who's as good as I was.
tt1375666,"00:24:40,820","00:24:42,811",I've got somebody better.
tt1375666,"00:24:42,989","00:24:44,013",Ariadne?
tt1375666,"00:24:46,626","00:24:49,151",I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.
tt1375666,"00:24:49,562","00:24:50,654",Pleased to meet you.
tt1375666,"00:24:50,830","00:24:55,494","If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has a job offer he'd like to discuss with you."
tt1375666,"00:24:55,668","00:24:56,692",A work placement?
tt1375666,"00:24:57,103","00:24:58,400",Not exactly.
tt1375666,"00:24:58,571","00:24:59,902",I have a test for you.
tt1375666,"00:25:00,640","00:25:02,699",You're not gonna tell me anything first?
tt1375666,"00:25:02,875","00:25:05,503","Before I describe the job, I have to know you can do it."
tt1375666,"00:25:05,678","00:25:08,875","- Why? - It's not, strictly speaking, legal."
tt1375666,"00:25:11,985","00:25:16,649",You have two minutes to design a maze that it takes one minute to solve.
tt1375666,"00:25:18,591","00:25:19,717",Stop.
tt1375666,"00:25:22,161","00:25:23,355",Again.
tt1375666,"00:25:25,498","00:25:26,829",Stop.
tt1375666,"00:25:30,003","00:25:32,062",You're gonna have to do better than that.
tt1375666,"00:25:45,084","00:25:46,346",That's more like it.
tt1375666,"00:26:06,539","00:26:09,440",They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential.
tt1375666,"00:26:09,609","00:26:11,304","Now, that's when we're awake."
tt1375666,"00:26:11,477","00:26:14,446","When we're asleep, our mind can do almost anything."
tt1375666,"00:26:14,614","00:26:15,638",Such as?
tt1375666,"00:26:15,815","00:26:19,808",Imagine you're designing a building. You consciously create each aspect.
tt1375666,"00:26:19,986","00:26:23,820","But sometimes, it feels like it's almost creating itself, if you know what I mean."
tt1375666,"00:26:23,990","00:26:25,958","Yeah, like I'm discovering it."
tt1375666,"00:26:26,125","00:26:28,389","Genuine inspiration, right?"
tt1375666,"00:26:28,561","00:26:31,894","Now, in a dream, our mind continuously does this."
tt1375666,"00:26:32,065","00:26:36,695",We create and perceive our world simultaneously.
tt1375666,"00:26:36,869","00:26:40,270",And our mind does this so well that we don't even know it's happening.
tt1375666,"00:26:40,440","00:26:43,170",That allows us to get right in the middle of that process.
tt1375666,"00:26:43,343","00:26:45,709",#NAME?
tt1375666,"00:26:45,878","00:26:47,505","Now, this is where I need you."
tt1375666,"00:26:47,680","00:26:50,046",You create the world of the dream.
tt1375666,"00:26:50,216","00:26:55,586","We bring the subject into that dream, and they fill it with their subconscious."
tt1375666,"00:26:55,755","00:27:00,419",How could I ever acquire enough detail to make them think that it's reality?
tt1375666,"00:27:00,593","00:27:04,051","Well, dreams, they feel real while we're in them, right?"
tt1375666,"00:27:04,230","00:27:07,927",It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.
tt1375666,"00:27:09,402","00:27:10,801",Let me ask you a question.
tt1375666,"00:27:10,970","00:27:14,371","You never really remember the beginning of a dream, do you?"
tt1375666,"00:27:14,540","00:27:17,566",You always wind up right in the middle of what's going on.
tt1375666,"00:27:17,744","00:27:18,768","I guess, yeah."
tt1375666,"00:27:18,945","00:27:20,503",So how did we end up here?
tt1375666,"00:27:20,913","00:27:22,972","Well, we just came from the, uh..."
tt1375666,"00:27:23,182","00:27:26,618","Think about it, Ariadne. How did you get here?"
tt1375666,"00:27:27,220","00:27:29,120",Where are you right now?
tt1375666,"00:27:32,425","00:27:33,585",We're dreaming?
tt1375666,"00:27:33,760","00:27:36,194","You're in the middle of the workshop, sleeping."
tt1375666,"00:27:36,362","00:27:39,331",This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.
tt1375666,"00:28:16,669","00:28:18,796","If it's just a dream, then why are you-?"
tt1375666,"00:28:20,440","00:28:22,169","Because it's never just a dream, is it?"
tt1375666,"00:28:22,341","00:28:25,640","And a face full of glass hurts like hell. When you're in it, it feels real."
tt1375666,"00:28:25,812","00:28:28,007",That's why the military developed dream sharing.
tt1375666,"00:28:28,181","00:28:31,878","It was a training program for soldiers to shoot, stab and strangle each other..."
tt1375666,"00:28:32,051","00:28:33,177",...and then wake up.
tt1375666,"00:28:33,486","00:28:35,283",How did architects become involved?
tt1375666,"00:28:35,455","00:28:38,185","Well, someone had to design the dreams, right?"
tt1375666,"00:28:39,325","00:28:41,657",Why don't you give us another five minutes?
tt1375666,"00:28:41,828","00:28:42,920",Five minutes?
tt1375666,"00:28:44,297","00:28:46,629","What-? We were talking for, like, at least an hour."
tt1375666,"00:28:46,799","00:28:49,029","In a dream, your mind functions more quickly..."
tt1375666,"00:28:49,202","00:28:52,035",...therefore time seems to feel more slow.
tt1375666,"00:28:52,205","00:28:55,572",Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream.
tt1375666,"00:28:56,309","00:28:59,369",Why don't you see what you can get up to in five minutes?
tt1375666,"00:29:05,284","00:29:08,219","You've got the basic layout. Bookstore, café."
tt1375666,"00:29:08,387","00:29:10,048",Almost everything else is here too.
tt1375666,"00:29:10,223","00:29:13,158",Who are the people? - Projections of my subconscious.
tt1375666,"00:29:13,326","00:29:14,486",#NAME?
tt1375666,"00:29:14,660","00:29:17,185","Remember, you are the dreamer. You build this world."
tt1375666,"00:29:17,363","00:29:20,025",I am the subject. My mind populates it.
tt1375666,"00:29:20,199","00:29:22,099",You can literally talk to my subconscious.
tt1375666,"00:29:22,268","00:29:25,169",That's one of the ways we extract information from the subject.
tt1375666,"00:29:25,338","00:29:26,600",How else do you do it?
tt1375666,"00:29:26,806","00:29:30,765","By creating something secure, like a bank vault or a jail."
tt1375666,"00:29:30,943","00:29:34,674",The mind automatically fills it with information it's trying to protect.
tt1375666,"00:29:34,847","00:29:37,611",#NAME?
tt1375666,"00:29:37,783","00:29:38,807",Well...
tt1375666,"00:29:38,985","00:29:43,479",I guess I thought that the dream space would be all about the visual...
tt1375666,"00:29:43,656","00:29:45,521",...but it's more about the feel of it.
tt1375666,"00:29:45,992","00:29:50,122",My question is what happens when you start messing with the physics of it all?
tt1375666,"00:30:31,470","00:30:33,028","It's something, isn't it?"
tt1375666,"00:30:34,140","00:30:35,437","Yes, it is."
tt1375666,"00:30:59,365","00:31:00,889",Why are they all looking at me?
tt1375666,"00:31:01,067","00:31:04,559",Because my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world.
tt1375666,"00:31:04,737","00:31:09,037","The more you change things, the quicker the projections start to converge on you."
tt1375666,"00:31:09,208","00:31:10,266",Converge?
tt1375666,"00:31:10,443","00:31:12,502",They sense the foreign nature of the dreamer.
tt1375666,"00:31:12,678","00:31:15,340","They attack, like white blood cells fighting an infection."
tt1375666,"00:31:15,514","00:31:18,347","- What, they're gonna attack us? - No, no."
tt1375666,"00:31:18,918","00:31:20,476",Just you.
tt1375666,"00:31:24,390","00:31:28,656","This is great, but I'm telling you, if you keep changing things like this..."
tt1375666,"00:31:32,164","00:31:35,133","Jeez, mind telling your subconscious to take it easy?"
tt1375666,"00:31:35,301","00:31:37,963",It's my subconscious. Remember? I can't control it.
tt1375666,"00:32:31,624","00:32:32,989",Very impressive.
tt1375666,"00:32:44,737","00:32:48,264","I know this bridge. This place is real, isn't it?"
tt1375666,"00:32:48,441","00:32:50,773","Yeah, I cross it every day to get to the college."
tt1375666,"00:32:50,943","00:32:54,379",Never re-create places from your memory. Always imagine new places.
tt1375666,"00:32:54,547","00:32:56,378","You draw from stuff you know, right?"
tt1375666,"00:32:56,549","00:33:00,747",Only use details. A streetlamp or a phone booth. Never entire areas.
tt1375666,"00:33:00,920","00:33:03,047",#NAME?
tt1375666,"00:33:03,222","00:33:06,714",...is the easiest way to lose your grasp on what's real and what is a dream.
tt1375666,"00:33:06,892","00:33:08,951",#NAME?
tt1375666,"00:33:09,128","00:33:11,119","This has nothing to do with me, understand?"
tt1375666,"00:33:11,297","00:33:13,265",That why you need me to build your dreams?
tt1375666,"00:33:13,432","00:33:15,957","Hey, get off of her. Back up. Back up."
tt1375666,"00:33:16,135","00:33:17,762",- Cobb! Cobb! - Get off of her!
tt1375666,"00:33:17,937","00:33:19,871",- Let me go! Let me go! - Mal!
tt1375666,"00:33:20,372","00:33:22,465",- Mal! - Cobb! Wake me up!
tt1375666,"00:33:22,641","00:33:24,438",- Wake me up! Wake me up! - No!
tt1375666,"00:33:24,610","00:33:26,100","- Mal, no! No! - Wake me up!"
tt1375666,"00:33:27,747","00:33:31,706","Hey, hey, hey. Look at me. You're okay. You're okay."
tt1375666,"00:33:31,884","00:33:35,115",- Hey. - Why wouldn't I wake up?
tt1375666,"00:33:35,421","00:33:37,013",There was still time on the clock.
tt1375666,"00:33:37,189","00:33:39,714",You can't wake up from within the dream unless you die.
tt1375666,"00:33:39,892","00:33:41,484",- She'll need a totem. What?
tt1375666,"00:33:41,660","00:33:43,127","A totem, it's a small personal-"
tt1375666,"00:33:43,295","00:33:45,820","That's some subconscious you've got on you, Cobb!"
tt1375666,"00:33:45,998","00:33:47,829",- She's a real charmer. - Oh.
tt1375666,"00:33:48,000","00:33:50,628",- I see you met Mrs. Cobb. - She's his wife?
tt1375666,"00:33:50,803","00:33:54,534","Yeah. So a totem. You need a small object, potentially heavy."
tt1375666,"00:33:54,707","00:33:57,175",Something you can have on you that no one else knows.
tt1375666,"00:33:57,343","00:33:58,605",Like a coin? No.
tt1375666,"00:33:58,778","00:34:03,408","It needs to be more unique than that. Like, this is a loaded die."
tt1375666,"00:34:04,517","00:34:07,418","No, I can't let you touch it. That would defeat the purpose."
tt1375666,"00:34:07,586","00:34:11,784","See, only I know the balance and the weight of this particular loaded die."
tt1375666,"00:34:11,957","00:34:13,788","That way, when you look at your totem..."
tt1375666,"00:34:13,959","00:34:17,053",...you know beyond a doubt that you're not in someone else's dream.
tt1375666,"00:34:20,499","00:34:24,799","I don't know if you can't see what's going on, or if you just don't want to..."
tt1375666,"00:34:24,970","00:34:28,497",...but Cobb has some serious problems that he's tried to bury down there.
tt1375666,"00:34:28,674","00:34:32,610",And I'm not about to just open my mind to someone like that.
tt1375666,"00:34:38,751","00:34:42,152",She'll be back. I've never seen anyone pick it up that quickly before.
tt1375666,"00:34:42,621","00:34:46,819","Reality's not gonna be enough for her now, and when she comes back..."
tt1375666,"00:34:47,493","00:34:50,155","When she comes back, you're gonna have her building mazes."
tt1375666,"00:34:50,329","00:34:52,593",#NAME?
tt1375666,"00:34:52,765","00:34:55,893","Eames? No, he's in Mombasa. It's Cobol's back yard."
tt1375666,"00:34:56,068","00:34:57,660",It's a necessary risk.
tt1375666,"00:34:58,070","00:35:01,301","- Well, there's plenty of good thieves. - We don't just need a thief."
tt1375666,"00:35:02,441","00:35:03,465",We need a forger.
tt1375666,"00:35:12,184","00:35:14,744","Rub them together all you want, they're not gonna breed."
tt1375666,"00:35:15,321","00:35:16,345",You never know.
tt1375666,"00:35:17,289","00:35:19,314",I'm gonna get you a drink.
tt1375666,"00:35:21,493","00:35:22,858",You're buying.
tt1375666,"00:35:29,335","00:35:31,633",- Your spelling hasn't improved. - Piss off.
tt1375666,"00:35:31,804","00:35:33,772",How's your handwriting?
tt1375666,"00:35:33,939","00:35:35,770",- It's versatile. - Good.
tt1375666,"00:35:35,941","00:35:37,169",Thank you very much.
tt1375666,"00:35:37,843","00:35:39,208",tt1375666.
tt1375666,"00:35:39,445","00:35:42,278","Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible, let me-"
tt1375666,"00:35:42,448","00:35:45,747","No, it's perfectly possible. It's just bloody difficult."
tt1375666,"00:35:45,918","00:35:49,183",Interesting. Because Arthur keeps telling me it can't be done.
tt1375666,"00:35:49,622","00:35:52,591",Hmm. Arthur. You still working with that stick in the mud?
tt1375666,"00:35:52,758","00:35:54,453","He is good at what he does, right?"
tt1375666,"00:35:54,627","00:35:56,686","Oh, he's the best, but he has no imagination."
tt1375666,"00:35:56,862","00:35:57,886",Not like you.
tt1375666,"00:35:58,063","00:36:01,032","Listen, if you're gonna perform tt1375666, you need imagination."
tt1375666,"00:36:01,200","00:36:04,761",Let me ask you something. Have you done it before?
tt1375666,"00:36:04,937","00:36:08,566","We tried it. Uh, we got the idea in place, but it didn't take."
tt1375666,"00:36:08,741","00:36:12,074","- You didn't plant it deep enough? - No, it's not just about depth."
tt1375666,"00:36:12,244","00:36:14,235",You need the simplest version of the idea...
tt1375666,"00:36:14,413","00:36:18,076",...in order for it to grow naturally in your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.
tt1375666,"00:36:18,250","00:36:20,775","So, what is this idea that you need to plant?"
tt1375666,"00:36:20,953","00:36:25,151",We need the heir of a major corporation to dissolve his father's empire.
tt1375666,"00:36:25,324","00:36:27,758",Right there you have various political motivations...
tt1375666,"00:36:27,927","00:36:29,918",...and anti-monopolistic sentiments and so forth.
tt1375666,"00:36:30,095","00:36:31,926","But all of that stuff, it's, um..."
tt1375666,"00:36:32,097","00:36:34,964","It's really at the mercy of your subject's prejudice, you see?"
tt1375666,"00:36:35,134","00:36:37,625",What you have to do is start at the absolute basic.
tt1375666,"00:36:37,803","00:36:39,361",Which is what?
tt1375666,"00:36:39,872","00:36:41,772",The relationship with the father.
tt1375666,"00:36:43,976","00:36:45,637",#NAME?
tt1375666,"00:36:45,811","00:36:48,871","Right. Okay, well, there's a man here, Yusuf."
tt1375666,"00:36:49,048","00:36:52,484","He, uh, formulates his own versions of the compounds."
tt1375666,"00:36:52,651","00:36:53,948",Why don't you take me there?
tt1375666,"00:36:54,119","00:36:57,179",Once you've lost your tail. The man at the bar.
tt1375666,"00:36:57,356","00:36:58,823",Cobol Engineering.
tt1375666,"00:36:58,991","00:37:01,323","That price on my head, was that dead or alive?"
tt1375666,"00:37:01,493","00:37:04,018",Don't remember. Let's see if he starts shooting.
tt1375666,"00:37:04,196","00:37:07,825","Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs in the bar in, say, uh, half an hour?"
tt1375666,"00:37:08,000","00:37:09,991",- Back here? - This is the last place they'd suspect.
tt1375666,"00:37:12,538","00:37:13,869",All right.
tt1375666,"00:37:15,040","00:37:16,871",Freddy. Freddy Simmonds.
tt1375666,"00:37:17,042","00:37:18,509","My God, it's you, isn't it?"
tt1375666,"00:37:22,047","00:37:23,105","No, it isn't you."
tt1375666,"00:37:23,282","00:37:24,715","Not dreaming now, are you?"
tt1375666,"00:37:26,919","00:37:28,511",Get him!
tt1375666,"00:37:44,036","00:37:45,162",There!
tt1375666,"00:38:05,657","00:38:07,420",One café.
tt1375666,"00:38:11,764","00:38:12,924",Shh.
tt1375666,"00:38:18,570","00:38:20,037",One café.
tt1375666,"00:38:21,073","00:38:22,540",One café.
tt1375666,"00:39:17,129","00:39:18,596","Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?"
tt1375666,"00:39:20,199","00:39:24,295",- What are you doing in Mombasa? - I'm here to protect my investment.
tt1375666,"00:39:26,805","00:39:29,740","Ah. So this is your idea of losing a tail, huh?"
tt1375666,"00:39:29,908","00:39:30,932",Different tail.
tt1375666,"00:39:39,651","00:39:41,380",Cobb said you'd be back.
tt1375666,"00:39:42,521","00:39:46,048","- I tried not to come, but... - But there's nothing quite like it."
tt1375666,"00:39:46,225","00:39:47,886",It's just...
tt1375666,"00:39:49,394","00:39:50,725",...pure creation.
tt1375666,"00:39:50,896","00:39:53,387",Shall we take a look at some paradoxical architecture?
tt1375666,"00:39:53,565","00:39:55,556",You're gonna have to master a few tricks...
tt1375666,"00:39:55,734","00:39:59,261",...if you're gonna build three complete dream levels. Excuse me.
tt1375666,"00:39:59,438","00:40:00,871",What kind of tricks?
tt1375666,"00:40:01,039","00:40:04,531","In a dream, you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes."
tt1375666,"00:40:04,710","00:40:08,612","That lets you create closed loops, like the Penrose Steps."
tt1375666,"00:40:09,481","00:40:11,472",The infinite staircase.
tt1375666,"00:40:14,186","00:40:15,619",See?
tt1375666,"00:40:19,791","00:40:20,849",Paradox.
tt1375666,"00:40:21,026","00:40:22,425",So a closed loop like that...
tt1375666,"00:40:22,594","00:40:25,688",...will help you disguise the boundaries of the dream you create.
tt1375666,"00:40:25,864","00:40:27,832",But how big do these levels have to be?
tt1375666,"00:40:28,000","00:40:31,128",It could be anything from the floor of a building to an entire city.
tt1375666,"00:40:31,303","00:40:34,739",They have to be complicated enough that we can hide from the projections.
tt1375666,"00:40:34,907","00:40:36,306",#NAME?
tt1375666,"00:40:36,475","00:40:37,806",And the better the maze...
tt1375666,"00:40:38,010","00:40:40,672",Then the longer we have before the projections catch us?
tt1375666,"00:40:40,846","00:40:42,108",Exactly.
tt1375666,"00:40:42,781","00:40:46,410","- My subconscious seems polite enough. - Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly."
tt1375666,"00:40:46,585","00:40:49,486",No one likes to feel someone else messing around in their mind.
tt1375666,"00:40:49,655","00:40:51,748","Cobb can't build anymore, can he?"
tt1375666,"00:40:53,592","00:40:55,423","I don't know if he can't, but he won't."
tt1375666,"00:40:55,594","00:40:57,994",He thinks it's safer if he doesn't know the layouts.
tt1375666,"00:40:58,163","00:40:59,255",Why?
tt1375666,"00:40:59,431","00:41:01,661",He won't tell me. But I think it's Mal.
tt1375666,"00:41:02,100","00:41:04,398",#NAME?
tt1375666,"00:41:04,570","00:41:07,733",- They're still together? - No.
tt1375666,"00:41:08,974","00:41:10,464","No, she's dead."
tt1375666,"00:41:12,444","00:41:15,174",What you see in there is just his projection of her.
tt1375666,"00:41:18,717","00:41:20,184",What was she like in real life?
tt1375666,"00:41:20,852","00:41:22,376",She was lovely.
tt1375666,"00:41:26,091","00:41:28,457",You are seeking a chemist? Yes.
tt1375666,"00:41:28,627","00:41:30,754",To formulate compounds for a job?
tt1375666,"00:41:31,430","00:41:33,295",And to go into the field with us.
tt1375666,"00:41:33,465","00:41:35,695","No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb."
tt1375666,"00:41:35,867","00:41:39,598","Well, we'd need you there to tailor compounds specific to our needs."
tt1375666,"00:41:39,771","00:41:41,864",#NAME?
tt1375666,"00:41:42,040","00:41:45,305",A dream within a dream? Two levels?
tt1375666,"00:41:48,080","00:41:49,104",Three.
tt1375666,"00:41:49,281","00:41:52,842",Not possible. That many dreams within dreams is too unstable.
tt1375666,"00:41:53,018","00:41:56,977",It is possible. You just have to add a sedative.
tt1375666,"00:41:57,155","00:41:59,817",A powerful sedative.
tt1375666,"00:42:01,627","00:42:03,857",#NAME?
tt1375666,"00:42:04,029","00:42:05,758",Six.
tt1375666,"00:42:06,632","00:42:10,659",The only way to know you've done the job is if I go in with you.
tt1375666,"00:42:10,836","00:42:13,930","There's no room for tourists on a job like this, Mr. Saito."
tt1375666,"00:42:14,106","00:42:16,472","This time, it seems there is."
tt1375666,"00:42:17,409","00:42:21,140","This, I think, is a good place to start. I use it every day."
tt1375666,"00:42:21,313","00:42:23,440","What for? - Here, I'll show you."
tt1375666,"00:42:27,753","00:42:29,482",Perhaps you will not want to see.
tt1375666,"00:42:32,424","00:42:34,016",After you.
tt1375666,"00:42:43,335","00:42:46,327",Ten. Twelve. All connected. Bloody hell.
tt1375666,"00:42:46,505","00:42:48,268",They come every day to share the dream.
tt1375666,"00:42:51,310","00:42:53,870",You see? Very stable.
tt1375666,"00:42:59,584","00:43:03,645",#NAME?
tt1375666,"00:43:03,922","00:43:04,946",In dream time?
tt1375666,"00:43:05,123","00:43:08,786","With this compound? About 40 hours, each and every day."
tt1375666,"00:43:08,960","00:43:12,259",#NAME?
tt1375666,"00:43:13,799","00:43:16,233","After a while, it becomes the only way you can dream."
tt1375666,"00:43:16,401","00:43:18,335","Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?"
tt1375666,"00:43:18,970","00:43:22,371",#NAME?
tt1375666,"00:43:24,109","00:43:26,805",They come to be woken up.
tt1375666,"00:43:27,813","00:43:31,112",The dream has become their reality.
tt1375666,"00:43:32,050","00:43:34,416","Who are you to say otherwise, sir?"
tt1375666,"00:43:36,722","00:43:38,349",Let's see what you can do.
tt1375666,"00:43:49,334","00:43:50,926",You know how to find me.
tt1375666,"00:43:53,538","00:43:55,529",You know what you have to do.
tt1375666,"00:44:00,779","00:44:01,837","Sharp, no?"
tt1375666,"00:44:17,429","00:44:20,262","Are you all right, Mr. Cobb?"
tt1375666,"00:44:20,799","00:44:24,565","Yeah, yeah. Everything's just fine."
tt1375666,"00:44:33,011","00:44:36,708","Robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate."
tt1375666,"00:44:36,882","00:44:38,782",What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?
tt1375666,"00:44:38,950","00:44:40,542",That's not your concern.
tt1375666,"00:44:40,952","00:44:45,321","Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical corporate espionage."
tt1375666,"00:44:45,490","00:44:47,082",You asked me for tt1375666.
tt1375666,"00:44:47,259","00:44:50,626",I do hope you understand the gravity of that request.
tt1375666,"00:44:50,796","00:44:54,755","Now, the seed that we plant in this man's mind will grow into an idea."
tt1375666,"00:44:54,933","00:44:56,798",This idea will define him.
tt1375666,"00:44:56,968","00:44:58,799",It may come to change...
tt1375666,"00:44:58,970","00:45:01,268","Well, it may come to change everything about him."
tt1375666,"00:45:01,440","00:45:05,774",We're the last company standing between them and total energy dominance.
tt1375666,"00:45:05,944","00:45:08,003",And we can no longer compete.
tt1375666,"00:45:08,180","00:45:11,638","Soon, they'll control the energy supply of half the world."
tt1375666,"00:45:11,817","00:45:14,183","In effect, they become a new superpower."
tt1375666,"00:45:15,587","00:45:18,920",The world needs Robert Fischer to change his mind.
tt1375666,"00:45:19,090","00:45:20,648",That's where we come in.
tt1375666,"00:45:20,826","00:45:24,091",How is Robert Fischer's relationship with his father?
tt1375666,"00:45:24,262","00:45:26,992",Rumor is the relationship is quite complicated.
tt1375666,"00:45:27,165","00:45:29,656","Well, we can't work based solely on rumor, can we?"
tt1375666,"00:45:29,835","00:45:33,032",Can you get me access to this man here? Browning.
tt1375666,"00:45:33,205","00:45:37,369",Fischer Senior's right-hand man. Fischer Junior's godfather.
tt1375666,"00:45:37,542","00:45:40,807","It should be possible, if you can get the right references."
tt1375666,"00:45:40,979","00:45:45,439","References are something of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito."
tt1375666,"00:45:46,084","00:45:49,019",I'm not smelling settlement here. Take them down.
tt1375666,"00:45:49,187","00:45:50,279",Mr. Browning...
tt1375666,"00:45:50,455","00:45:54,289",...Maurice Fischer's policy is always one of avoiding litigation.
tt1375666,"00:45:56,862","00:46:01,322","Well, shall we voice your concerns with Maurice directly?"
tt1375666,"00:46:01,500","00:46:02,899",Not sure that's necessary.
tt1375666,"00:46:03,068","00:46:05,730","No, no, no. I think we should."
tt1375666,"00:46:27,025","00:46:28,583",How is he?
tt1375666,"00:46:29,427","00:46:32,191","I don't want to bother him unnecessarily, but-"
tt1375666,"00:46:32,364","00:46:37,825","Robert, I told you keep out the damn- Wait. So do it. Get-"
tt1375666,"00:46:38,103","00:46:41,197",Mr. Fischer. Put it through.
tt1375666,"00:46:41,573","00:46:45,168","Never, never. Never do the same as I asked."
tt1375666,"00:46:46,478","00:46:48,139",Leave that.
tt1375666,"00:46:51,850","00:46:53,215",Here.
tt1375666,"00:46:55,487","00:46:57,887",Must be a cherished memory of his.
tt1375666,"00:46:58,990","00:47:03,518",I put it beside his bed. He hasn't even noticed.
tt1375666,"00:47:03,695","00:47:05,356",Robert...
tt1375666,"00:47:07,732","00:47:10,132",...we need to talk about a power of attorney.
tt1375666,"00:47:10,302","00:47:13,601","- I know this is hard, but it's imperative- - Not now, Uncle Peter."
tt1375666,"00:47:17,609","00:47:19,406",The vultures are circling.
tt1375666,"00:47:19,578","00:47:23,981","And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the more powerful Peter Browning becomes."
tt1375666,"00:47:24,149","00:47:26,549",I've had ample opportunity to observe Browning...
tt1375666,"00:47:27,185","00:47:31,554","...and adopt his physical presence, study his mannerisms, and so on and so forth."
tt1375666,"00:47:31,723","00:47:35,591","So now in the first layer of the dream, I can impersonate Browning."
tt1375666,"00:47:35,760","00:47:38,991",And suggest concepts to Fischer's conscious mind.
tt1375666,"00:47:39,164","00:47:40,995","Then, when we take him a level deeper..."
tt1375666,"00:47:41,166","00:47:44,658",...his own projection of Browning should feed that right back to him.
tt1375666,"00:47:44,836","00:47:46,770",So he gives himself the idea.
tt1375666,"00:47:46,938","00:47:51,170",Precisely. That's the only way it will stick. It has to seem self-generated.
tt1375666,"00:47:51,343","00:47:54,744","Eames, I am impressed."
tt1375666,"00:47:54,913","00:47:58,474","Your condescension, as always, is much appreciated, Arthur, thank you."
tt1375666,"00:48:19,838","00:48:21,829",Were you going under on your own?
tt1375666,"00:48:22,007","00:48:25,499","No, no, I was just, uh, running some experiments."
tt1375666,"00:48:25,677","00:48:27,645","I didn't realize anyone was here, so..."
tt1375666,"00:48:27,812","00:48:30,474","Yeah, I was just- I was working on my totem, actually."
tt1375666,"00:48:30,649","00:48:31,809","Here, let me take a look."
tt1375666,"00:48:33,985","00:48:35,282","So you're learning, huh?"
tt1375666,"00:48:35,453","00:48:38,945",An elegant solution for keeping track of reality.
tt1375666,"00:48:39,591","00:48:41,991",#NAME?
tt1375666,"00:48:42,227","00:48:44,286","It was Mal's, actually. This..."
tt1375666,"00:48:44,996","00:48:48,762",This one was hers. She would spin it in the dream and it would never topple.
tt1375666,"00:48:48,967","00:48:51,868",Just spin and spin.
tt1375666,"00:48:53,405","00:48:55,339",Arthur told me she passed away.
tt1375666,"00:48:57,242","00:48:59,301",How are the mazes coming along?
tt1375666,"00:48:59,477","00:49:02,378",Each level relates to the part of the subject's subconscious...
tt1375666,"00:49:02,547","00:49:04,014",...that we are trying to access.
tt1375666,"00:49:04,182","00:49:09,620","So I'm making the bottom level a hospital, so Fischer will bring his father."
tt1375666,"00:49:09,988","00:49:12,752","You know, l- Actually, I have a question about this layout."
tt1375666,"00:49:12,924","00:49:17,657","No, no, no. Don't show me specifics. Only the dreamer should know the layout."
tt1375666,"00:49:17,829","00:49:18,989",Why is that so important?
tt1375666,"00:49:19,164","00:49:21,155",In case one of us brings in our projections.
tt1375666,"00:49:21,332","00:49:23,664",We don't want them knowing the details of the maze.
tt1375666,"00:49:25,070","00:49:27,538",You mean in case you bring Mal in.
tt1375666,"00:49:27,706","00:49:30,106","You can't keep her out, can you?"
tt1375666,"00:49:31,009","00:49:32,533",- Right. - You can't build...
tt1375666,"00:49:32,711","00:49:36,010","...because if you know the maze, then she knows it."
tt1375666,"00:49:36,181","00:49:38,376","Well, she'd sabotage the whole operation."
tt1375666,"00:49:38,550","00:49:41,348","- Cobb, do the others know? - No. No, they don't."
tt1375666,"00:49:41,519","00:49:43,749",You've gotta warn them if this is getting worse.
tt1375666,"00:49:43,922","00:49:45,856",No one said it's getting worse.
tt1375666,"00:49:47,058","00:49:50,357",I need to get home. That's all I care about right now.
tt1375666,"00:49:51,229","00:49:53,288",Why can't you go home?
tt1375666,"00:49:56,401","00:49:58,426",Because they think I killed her.
tt1375666,"00:50:01,673","00:50:03,937",#NAME?
tt1375666,"00:50:04,142","00:50:06,406",For not asking whether I did.

tt1375666,"00:50:08,913","00:50:13,111","Now, this is obviously an idea that Robert himself would choose to reject..."
tt1375666,"00:50:13,284","00:50:16,082",...which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious.
tt1375666,"00:50:16,254","00:50:19,781","The subconscious is motivated by emotion, right? Not reason."
tt1375666,"00:50:19,958","00:50:23,724",We need to find a way to translate this into an emotional concept.
tt1375666,"00:50:23,895","00:50:26,329",How do you translate business strategy into emotion?
tt1375666,"00:50:26,498","00:50:30,093",That's what we're here to figure out. Robert's relationship with his father...
tt1375666,"00:50:30,268","00:50:32,998","...is stressed, to say the least. - Can we run with that?"
tt1375666,"00:50:33,171","00:50:36,766","We suggest breaking up his father's company as a ""screw you"" to the old man."
tt1375666,"00:50:36,941","00:50:40,399","No, because I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time."
tt1375666,"00:50:40,812","00:50:44,509","We all yearn for reconciliation, for catharsis."
tt1375666,"00:50:44,682","00:50:48,448",We need Robert Fischer to have a positive emotional reaction to all this.
tt1375666,"00:50:48,620","00:50:50,451","All right, well, try this. Um..."
tt1375666,"00:50:50,622","00:50:55,355","""My father accepts that I want to create for myself, not follow in his footsteps."""
tt1375666,"00:50:55,760","00:50:56,818",That might work.
tt1375666,"00:50:56,995","00:51:00,158","Might? We're gonna need to do a little better than ""might."""
tt1375666,"00:51:00,331","00:51:02,299","Thank you for your contribution, Arthur."
tt1375666,"00:51:02,467","00:51:05,402","Forgive me for wanting a little specificity, Eames."

tt1375666,"00:51:06,871","00:51:08,702",tt1375666's not about being specific.
tt1375666,"00:51:08,873","00:51:12,832","When we get inside his mind, we're gonna have to work with what we find."
tt1375666,"00:51:14,145","00:51:17,137","On the top level, we open up his relationship with his father..."
tt1375666,"00:51:17,315","00:51:20,375","...and say, ""I will not follow in my father's footsteps."""
tt1375666,"00:51:20,552","00:51:25,216","Then the next level down, we feed him, ""I will create something for myself."""
tt1375666,"00:51:25,390","00:51:28,723","Then, by the time we hit the bottom level, we bring out the big guns."

tt1375666,"00:51:36,835","00:51:37,995",Sedation.
tt1375666,"00:51:38,169","00:51:41,002",For sleep stable enough to create three layers of dreaming...
tt1375666,"00:51:41,172","00:51:45,074",...we'll have to combine it with an extremely powerful sedative.
tt1375666,"00:51:56,521","00:51:57,579",Good night.
tt1375666,"00:51:58,189","00:52:00,384",The compound we'll be using to share the dream...
tt1375666,"00:52:00,558","00:52:02,492",...creates a clear connection between dreamers...
tt1375666,"00:52:02,660","00:52:06,892","...whilst accelerating brain function. - In other words, more time on each level."
tt1375666,"00:52:07,065","00:52:10,228",Brain function in the dream will be about 20 times normal.
tt1375666,"00:52:10,401","00:52:13,893","And when you enter a dream within that dream, the effect is compounded."
tt1375666,"00:52:14,072","00:52:16,165","It's three dreams, that's 10 hours times 20-"
tt1375666,"00:52:16,341","00:52:19,242",Math was never my strong subject. How much time is that?
tt1375666,"00:52:19,410","00:52:22,072","It's a week, the first level down."
tt1375666,"00:52:22,780","00:52:25,613","Six months the second level down, and the third level-"
tt1375666,"00:52:25,783","00:52:27,216",That's 10 years.
tt1375666,"00:52:29,854","00:52:32,015",Who'd wanna be stuck in a dream for 10 years?
tt1375666,"00:52:32,423","00:52:33,583",Depends on the dream.
tt1375666,"00:52:33,758","00:52:36,056","So once we've made the plant, how do we get out?"
tt1375666,"00:52:36,227","00:52:39,560",I'm hoping you have something more elegant than shooting me in the head.
tt1375666,"00:52:39,731","00:52:42,495",- A kick. - What's a kick?
tt1375666,"00:52:42,667","00:52:45,363","This, Ariadne, would be a kick."
tt1375666,"00:52:47,505","00:52:50,201",It's that feeling of falling you get that jolts you awake.
tt1375666,"00:52:50,375","00:52:53,606",#NAME?
tt1375666,"00:52:53,778","00:52:54,972",That's the clever part.
tt1375666,"00:52:55,146","00:52:58,377",I customized the sedative to leave inner-ear function unimpaired.
tt1375666,"00:52:58,549","00:53:03,384","That way, however deep the sleep, the sleeper still feels falling."
tt1375666,"00:53:03,554","00:53:05,920",Or tipping.
tt1375666,"00:53:06,557","00:53:10,721",The trick is to synchronize a kick that can penetrate all three levels.
tt1375666,"00:53:11,262","00:53:14,789",We could use a musical countdown to synchronize the different kicks.
tt1375666,"00:53:22,674","00:53:26,166","He hasn't got any surgery scheduled, no dental, nothing."
tt1375666,"00:53:26,344","00:53:28,335",Wasn't he supposed to have a knee operation?
tt1375666,"00:53:28,513","00:53:31,744","Nothing. Nothing that they'll put him under for, anyway. And we need-"
tt1375666,"00:53:31,916","00:53:33,850",We need at least a good 10 hours.
tt1375666,"00:53:34,018","00:53:35,349",Sydney to Los Angeles.
tt1375666,"00:53:36,688","00:53:40,954",One of the longest flights in the world. He makes it every two weeks.
tt1375666,"00:53:41,125","00:53:43,286","He must be flying private, then."
tt1375666,"00:53:43,795","00:53:46,958",Not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane.
tt1375666,"00:53:47,131","00:53:49,361",It would have to be a 747. - Why's that?
tt1375666,"00:53:49,534","00:53:51,001","On a 747, the pilot's up top..."
tt1375666,"00:53:51,169","00:53:54,366","...the first-class cabin's in the nose, so no one would walk through."
tt1375666,"00:53:54,539","00:53:58,031",You'd have to buy out the entire cabin and the first-class flight attendant.
tt1375666,"00:53:58,209","00:53:59,767",I bought the airline.
tt1375666,"00:54:01,346","00:54:03,143",It seemed neater.
tt1375666,"00:54:04,749","00:54:07,547","Well, looks like we have our 10 hours."
tt1375666,"00:54:08,219","00:54:11,347","Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way."
tt1375666,"00:54:59,370","00:55:01,531",You know how to find me.
tt1375666,"00:55:03,007","00:55:04,440",You know what you have to do.
tt1375666,"00:55:08,279","00:55:11,737",You remember when you asked me to marry you?
tt1375666,"00:55:12,617","00:55:14,642",Of course I do.
tt1375666,"00:55:15,753","00:55:18,244",You said you had a dream.
tt1375666,"00:55:21,192","00:55:23,956",That we'd grow old together.
tt1375666,"00:55:25,396","00:55:27,091",And we can.
tt1375666,"00:55:33,771","00:55:35,705",You shouldn't be here.
tt1375666,"00:55:39,477","00:55:42,935",Just wanted to see what kind of tests you're doing on your own every night.

tt1375666,"00:55:46,484","00:55:52,286",- You've asked me to share dreams with you. - Not these. These are my dreams.
tt1375666,"00:56:03,167","00:56:05,567",Why do you do this to yourself?
tt1375666,"00:56:05,736","00:56:08,671",It's the only way I can still dream.
tt1375666,"00:56:10,441","00:56:12,636",Why is it so important to dream?
tt1375666,"00:56:13,544","00:56:15,808","In my dreams, we're still together."
tt1375666,"00:56:30,161","00:56:31,890",These aren't just dreams.
tt1375666,"00:56:33,698","00:56:36,724",These are memories. And you said never to use memories.
tt1375666,"00:56:36,901","00:56:37,959",I know I did.
tt1375666,"00:56:38,603","00:56:43,131",You're trying to keep her alive. You can't let her go.
tt1375666,"00:56:43,307","00:56:46,299",You don't understand. These are moments I regret.
tt1375666,"00:56:46,477","00:56:49,037",They're memories that I have to change.
tt1375666,"00:56:50,281","00:56:52,749","Well, what's down there that you regret?"
tt1375666,"00:56:53,151","00:56:56,279","Listen, there's only one thing you need to understand about me."
tt1375666,"00:57:04,762","00:57:06,354",This is your house?
tt1375666,"00:57:07,031","00:57:09,499","Mine and Mal's, yes."
tt1375666,"00:57:09,667","00:57:11,362",Where is she?
tt1375666,"00:57:12,036","00:57:14,027",She's already gone.
tt1375666,"00:57:18,776","00:57:20,300","That's my son, James."
tt1375666,"00:57:20,478","00:57:23,572","He's digging for something, maybe a worm."
tt1375666,"00:57:24,949","00:57:26,075",That's Phillipa.
tt1375666,"00:57:26,617","00:57:28,482",I thought about calling out to them...
tt1375666,"00:57:28,653","00:57:31,417",...so they'd turn and smile and I could see...
tt1375666,"00:57:32,123","00:57:37,254","...those beautiful faces of theirs, but it's all too late."
tt1375666,"00:57:37,428","00:57:40,261","Right now or never, Cobb."
tt1375666,"00:57:44,735","00:57:46,532",Then I start to panic.
tt1375666,"00:57:46,704","00:57:49,400",I realize I'm gonna regret this moment...
tt1375666,"00:57:50,241","00:57:52,573",...that I need to see their faces one last time.
tt1375666,"00:57:52,743","00:57:55,234",James! Phillipa! Come on in!
tt1375666,"00:57:55,413","00:57:57,438",But the moment's past.
tt1375666,"00:57:59,650","00:58:03,017","And whatever I do, I can't change this moment."
tt1375666,"00:58:03,921","00:58:06,082",As I'm about to call out to them...
tt1375666,"00:58:07,124","00:58:08,216",...they run away.
tt1375666,"00:58:10,962","00:58:14,227","If I'm ever gonna see their faces again, I've gotta get back home."
tt1375666,"00:58:15,266","00:58:16,756",The real world.
tt1375666,"00:58:58,342","00:58:59,809",What are you doing here?

tt1375666,"00:59:01,912","00:59:05,211",I know who you are. What are you doing here?
tt1375666,"00:59:13,391","00:59:15,825",I'm just trying to understand.
tt1375666,"00:59:15,993","00:59:18,120",How could you understand?
tt1375666,"00:59:19,330","00:59:21,457",Do you know what it is to be a lover?
tt1375666,"00:59:23,467","00:59:25,594",To be half of a whole?
tt1375666,"00:59:26,837","00:59:28,395",No.
tt1375666,"00:59:29,874","00:59:31,865",I'll tell you a riddle.

tt1375666,"00:59:36,681","00:59:39,844",A train that will take you far away.
tt1375666,"00:59:41,218","00:59:44,187",You know where you hope this train will take you...
tt1375666,"00:59:45,222","00:59:47,486",...but you don't know for sure.
tt1375666,"00:59:47,658","00:59:49,558",But it doesn't matter.
tt1375666,"00:59:50,528","00:59:53,929",How can it not matter to you where that train will take you?
tt1375666,"00:59:54,098","00:59:55,861",Because you'll be together.
tt1375666,"00:59:56,901","00:59:59,995","How could you bring her here, Dom? - What is this place?"
tt1375666,"01:00:00,404","01:00:03,567",This is a hotel suite where we used to spend our anniversary.
tt1375666,"01:00:03,741","01:00:05,072",What happened here?
tt1375666,"01:00:06,977","01:00:09,810",You promised! You promised we'd be together!
tt1375666,"01:00:10,247","01:00:12,306","Please, I need you to stay here just for now!"
tt1375666,"01:00:12,483","01:00:15,714",You said we'd be together! You said we'd grow old together!
tt1375666,"01:00:15,886","01:00:18,354",I'll come back for you. I promise.
tt1375666,"01:00:36,574","01:00:41,944",Do you think you can just build a prison of memories to lock her in?
tt1375666,"01:00:42,580","01:00:44,946",Do you really think that that's gonna contain her?
tt1375666,"01:00:45,850","01:00:47,112",It's time.
tt1375666,"01:00:48,352","01:00:50,684",Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.
tt1375666,"01:00:50,855","01:00:53,016",- When's the funeral? - Thursday. In Los Angeles.
tt1375666,"01:00:53,190","01:00:56,455",Robert should accompany the body no later than Tuesday. We should move.
tt1375666,"01:00:56,627","01:00:58,094",All right.
tt1375666,"01:00:58,696","01:01:01,722","- Cobb, I'm coming with you. - I promised Miles. No."
tt1375666,"01:01:01,899","01:01:05,027",The team needs someone who understands what you're struggling with.
tt1375666,"01:01:07,605","01:01:09,766",And it doesn't have to be me...
tt1375666,"01:01:09,940","01:01:13,239",...but then you have to show Arthur what I just saw.
tt1375666,"01:01:19,016","01:01:20,711",Get us another seat on the plane.
tt1375666,"01:01:24,789","01:01:27,815",If I get on this plane and you don't honor our agreement...
tt1375666,"01:01:27,992","01:01:31,655","...when we land, I go to jail for the rest of my life."
tt1375666,"01:01:32,329","01:01:34,524",Complete the job en route...
tt1375666,"01:01:34,698","01:01:37,166",...I make one phone call from the plane...
tt1375666,"01:01:37,334","01:01:40,235",...you have no trouble getting through Immigration.
tt1375666,"01:01:53,984","01:01:56,475","- I'm sorry. - Oh, yeah, absolutely."
tt1375666,"01:01:56,654","01:01:58,212",Thank you.
tt1375666,"01:02:31,822","01:02:35,121","Excuse me, I think this is yours? You must have dropped it."
tt1375666,"01:02:35,292","01:02:37,192",Would you care for a drink?
tt1375666,"01:02:37,361","01:02:38,658","Oh. Water, please."
tt1375666,"01:02:38,829","01:02:41,127","Oh, um, same, please."
tt1375666,"01:02:42,099","01:02:43,396",Um...
tt1375666,"01:02:44,134","01:02:45,226",Thank you.
tt1375666,"01:02:45,402","01:02:47,267","You know, I couldn't help but notice..."
tt1375666,"01:02:47,438","01:02:51,033","...but you wouldn't happen to be related to the Maurice Fischer, would you?"
tt1375666,"01:02:51,208","01:02:52,698","Yes, he, um..."
tt1375666,"01:02:53,644","01:02:55,635",He was my father.
tt1375666,"01:02:56,080","01:03:00,107","Well, he was a very inspiring figure. I'm sorry for your loss."
tt1375666,"01:03:03,087","01:03:04,748",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:03:04,922","01:03:06,253",Hey.
tt1375666,"01:03:06,657","01:03:08,284",To your father.
tt1375666,"01:03:08,893","01:03:11,123","May he rest in peace, huh?"
tt1375666,"01:04:19,597","01:04:21,895",- Couldn't have peed before you went under? - Sorry.
tt1375666,"01:04:22,066","01:04:24,125",Bit too much free champagne before takeoff?
tt1375666,"01:04:24,301","01:04:25,393","Ha, ha, bloody ha."
tt1375666,"01:04:25,569","01:04:28,538",We know he's gonna be looking for a taxi in this weather.
tt1375666,"01:04:40,217","01:04:44,244","- Asshole! Hey, man, why don't you try-? - Walk away."
tt1375666,"01:05:00,137","01:05:01,536",Just have him ca- I gotta go.
tt1375666,"01:05:01,705","01:05:03,832",All right. Taxi. Thank you.
tt1375666,"01:05:06,777","01:05:09,644","All right, Third and Market. Snappy."
tt1375666,"01:05:10,214","01:05:12,546",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:05:12,716","01:05:14,206",- It's not. - Maybe we could share.
tt1375666,"01:05:14,385","01:05:17,218",Maybe not. Can you pull over and get this-?
tt1375666,"01:05:20,190","01:05:21,521",Great.
tt1375666,"01:05:26,463","01:05:27,930",Come on.
tt1375666,"01:05:39,043","01:05:41,671",There's $500 in there. The wallet's worth more than that.
tt1375666,"01:05:41,845","01:05:43,540",You might at least drop me at my stop.
tt1375666,"01:05:43,714","01:05:44,806",I'm afraid that it doesn't-
tt1375666,"01:05:54,525","01:05:56,322",- Cover him! Down! Down now!
tt1375666,"01:05:56,493","01:05:58,120",What the hell is going on?
tt1375666,"01:06:01,865","01:06:04,095",This wasn't in the design.
tt1375666,"01:06:05,035","01:06:06,400",Cobb?
tt1375666,"01:06:06,637","01:06:07,661",Cobb?
tt1375666,"01:06:58,589","01:06:59,783",Get him!
tt1375666,"01:07:06,463","01:07:07,896",Are you all right?
tt1375666,"01:07:08,098","01:07:10,259","Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay."
tt1375666,"01:07:10,434","01:07:12,334","Fischer's okay, unless he gets carsick."
tt1375666,"01:07:12,503","01:07:13,731",Saito?
tt1375666,"01:07:32,656","01:07:34,783",Get Fischer in the back room now.
tt1375666,"01:07:35,092","01:07:37,788",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:07:38,228","01:07:39,695",Has he been shot? Is he dying?
tt1375666,"01:07:39,863","01:07:41,592",I don't know. - Jesus Christ.
tt1375666,"01:07:41,765","01:07:44,199",What happened to you? - Blocked by a freight train.
tt1375666,"01:07:44,368","01:07:46,336",Why put a train in a downtown intersection?
tt1375666,"01:07:46,503","01:07:48,095",- I didn't. Where'd it come from?
tt1375666,"01:07:48,272","01:07:49,933",Why the hell were we ambushed?
tt1375666,"01:07:50,107","01:07:53,508","Those were not normal projections. They'd been trained, for God's sakes."
tt1375666,"01:07:53,677","01:07:56,237",- How could he be trained? - Fischer's had an extractor...
tt1375666,"01:07:56,413","01:08:00,611","...teach his subconscious to defend itself, so his subconscious is militarized."
tt1375666,"01:08:00,784","01:08:02,411",It should've shown in the research.
tt1375666,"01:08:02,586","01:08:04,383",Why the hell didn't it? - Calm down.
tt1375666,"01:08:04,555","01:08:05,886",Don't tell me to calm down!
tt1375666,"01:08:06,056","01:08:08,991","This was your job, goddamn it! This was your responsibility!"
tt1375666,"01:08:09,159","01:08:11,218",You were meant to check Fischer's background!
tt1375666,"01:08:11,395","01:08:14,728",- We are not prepared for this! - We have dealt with sub-security before!
tt1375666,"01:08:14,898","01:08:16,991",We'll be more careful and we're gonna be fine!
tt1375666,"01:08:17,167","01:08:18,964",This was not a part of the plan! He's dying.
tt1375666,"01:08:19,136","01:08:20,194",Put him out his misery.
tt1375666,"01:08:20,370","01:08:23,203","- No, don't do that! Don't do that. - Cobb, hey, hey."
tt1375666,"01:08:23,373","01:08:25,466",He's in agony. I'm waking him up.
tt1375666,"01:08:25,642","01:08:27,542",No. It won't wake him up.
tt1375666,"01:08:27,711","01:08:31,306","What do you mean, it won't wake him up? When we die in a dream, we wake up."
tt1375666,"01:08:31,481","01:08:32,743",Not from this.
tt1375666,"01:08:32,916","01:08:35,441",We're too heavily sedated to wake up that way.
tt1375666,"01:08:36,053","01:08:37,748","Right. So, what happens when we die?"
tt1375666,"01:08:37,921","01:08:39,752",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:08:39,923","01:08:42,448",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:08:42,626","01:08:45,891","Well, what the hell is down there? - Just raw, infinite subconscious."
tt1375666,"01:08:46,063","01:08:49,260","Nothing is down there, except for what might have been left behind..."
tt1375666,"01:08:49,433","01:08:52,334",...by anyone sharing the dream who's been trapped there before.
tt1375666,"01:08:52,502","01:08:54,402","Which, in our case, is just you."
tt1375666,"01:08:54,571","01:08:57,267",- How long could we be stuck? Can't even think about...
tt1375666,"01:08:57,441","01:08:59,841",...trying to escape until the sedation- - How long?
tt1375666,"01:09:00,010","01:09:03,241","Decades. It could be infinite. Ask him, he's the one who's been there."
tt1375666,"01:09:03,413","01:09:04,607",Let's get him upstairs.
tt1375666,"01:09:06,250","01:09:07,683",Great.
tt1375666,"01:09:08,685","01:09:10,152",Thank you.
tt1375666,"01:09:10,854","01:09:14,085","So now we're trapped in Fischer's mind, battling his own private army."
tt1375666,"01:09:14,258","01:09:15,725",And if we get killed...
tt1375666,"01:09:15,893","01:09:19,124","...we'll be lost in limbo till our brains turn to scrambled egg, hmm?"
tt1375666,"01:09:26,036","01:09:27,867",Someone got first aid?
tt1375666,"01:09:30,140","01:09:33,598",- You knew these risks and didn't tell us? - There weren't meant to be risks.
tt1375666,"01:09:33,777","01:09:36,712",- I didn't know we'd be dealing with gunfire. - You had no right.
tt1375666,"01:09:36,880","01:09:39,212",This was the only way to go three layers deep.
tt1375666,"01:09:39,383","01:09:41,408",You knew about this and went along with it?
tt1375666,"01:09:41,585","01:09:42,609",I trusted him.
tt1375666,"01:09:42,786","01:09:44,686",When? When he promised you half his share?
tt1375666,"01:09:44,855","01:09:48,120","No. His whole share. Besides, he said he'd done it before."
tt1375666,"01:09:48,292","01:09:50,351","What, with Mal? Because that worked so good?"
tt1375666,"01:09:50,527","01:09:53,963",That has nothing to do with it. I did what I had to to get to my children.
tt1375666,"01:09:54,131","01:09:56,031",You led us into a war zone with no way out?
tt1375666,"01:09:56,199","01:10:00,226","There is a way out. We continue on with the job, and we do it as fast as possible..."
tt1375666,"01:10:00,404","01:10:02,736","...and we get out using the kick, just like before."
tt1375666,"01:10:02,906","01:10:05,374","Forget it. We go any deeper, we just raise the stakes."
tt1375666,"01:10:05,542","01:10:07,407",I am sitting this one out on this level.
tt1375666,"01:10:07,577","01:10:10,011",Fischer's security is surrounding this place.
tt1375666,"01:10:10,180","01:10:12,444",Ten hours of flight time is a week at this level.
tt1375666,"01:10:12,616","01:10:16,347",That means each and every one of us will be killed. That I can guarantee you.
tt1375666,"01:10:16,954","01:10:20,720",We have no other choice but to continue on and do it as fast as possible.
tt1375666,"01:10:22,326","01:10:24,760",Downwards is the only way forwards.
tt1375666,"01:10:26,330","01:10:27,456",Get ready.
tt1375666,"01:10:27,631","01:10:29,826","You, come on. Let's go shake him up."
tt1375666,"01:10:34,671","01:10:37,697",I'm insured against kidnapping for up to 10 million.
tt1375666,"01:10:37,874","01:10:40,809",- This should be very simple. Shut up! It won't be.
tt1375666,"01:10:40,978","01:10:43,242","In your father's office, below the bookshelves..."
tt1375666,"01:10:43,413","01:10:45,472",...is his personal safe. We need the combination.
tt1375666,"01:10:46,850","01:10:48,249",I don't know any safe.
tt1375666,"01:10:48,452","01:10:51,319",That doesn't mean you don't know the combination.
tt1375666,"01:10:52,956","01:10:54,287",Tell us what it is.
tt1375666,"01:10:55,158","01:10:56,887",I don't know.
tt1375666,"01:11:01,832","01:11:03,959",We have it on good authority you do know.
tt1375666,"01:11:04,134","01:11:06,466",Yeah? Whose authority?
tt1375666,"01:11:07,971","01:11:11,463","- Five hundred dollars, this cost. What's inside it?"
tt1375666,"01:11:11,742","01:11:15,508","Cash, cards, ID. And this."
tt1375666,"01:11:20,550","01:11:22,040",Useful?
tt1375666,"01:11:22,786","01:11:23,810",Maybe.
tt1375666,"01:11:24,287","01:11:26,084",You're on. You've got an hour.
tt1375666,"01:11:26,490","01:11:27,514",An hour?
tt1375666,"01:11:28,825","01:11:31,089",I was supposed to have all night to crack this.
tt1375666,"01:11:31,261","01:11:33,855",And Saito wasn't supposed to be shot in the chest.
tt1375666,"01:11:34,031","01:11:37,194","You've got one hour, now get us something useful, please."
tt1375666,"01:11:39,736","01:11:42,170",- What's that? - Good authority.
tt1375666,"01:11:46,410","01:11:48,105",Uncle Peter.
tt1375666,"01:11:48,812","01:11:50,939",Just make them stop.
tt1375666,"01:11:51,248","01:11:53,580",- The combination. - I don't know it.
tt1375666,"01:11:53,750","01:11:56,412",- Why does Browning say you do? - I don't know.
tt1375666,"01:11:56,586","01:11:59,054",Just let me talk to him and I'll find out.
tt1375666,"01:12:01,425","01:12:04,121",You have one hour. Start talking.
tt1375666,"01:12:06,129","01:12:07,323",You all right?
tt1375666,"01:12:09,232","01:12:10,529",You okay?
tt1375666,"01:12:14,237","01:12:17,900",Those bastards have had at me for two days.
tt1375666,"01:12:18,575","01:12:21,043",They have someone with access to your father's office.
tt1375666,"01:12:21,211","01:12:23,076",- They're trying to open his safe. - Yeah.
tt1375666,"01:12:23,246","01:12:25,976","They thought I'd know the combination, but I don't know it."
tt1375666,"01:12:26,149","01:12:28,879",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:12:29,653","01:12:32,884","Maurice told me that when he passed, you were the only one able to open it."
tt1375666,"01:12:33,056","01:12:35,581","No, he never gave me any combination."
tt1375666,"01:12:36,326","01:12:40,456","Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you just didn't know it was a combination."
tt1375666,"01:12:40,630","01:12:41,824","Well, what, then?"
tt1375666,"01:12:41,998","01:12:44,523","I don't know, some meaningful combination of numbers..."
tt1375666,"01:12:44,701","01:12:48,637",...based on your experiences with Maurice.
tt1375666,"01:12:50,340","01:12:54,276","We didn't have very many, uh, meaningful experiences together."
tt1375666,"01:12:55,011","01:12:56,478",Perhaps after your mother died.
tt1375666,"01:12:59,149","01:13:01,276","After my mother died, you know what he told me?"
tt1375666,"01:13:03,760","01:13:08,720","""Robert, there's really nothing to be said."""
tt1375666,"01:13:08,898","01:13:11,230","Oh, well, he was bad with emotion."
tt1375666,"01:13:11,401","01:13:14,097","I was 11, Uncle Peter."
tt1375666,"01:13:14,871","01:13:18,102",- How's he doing? - He's in a lot of pain.
tt1375666,"01:13:18,274","01:13:21,869","When we get down to the lower levels, the pain will be less intense."
tt1375666,"01:13:22,045","01:13:23,273",And if he dies?
tt1375666,"01:13:24,447","01:13:25,914",Worst-case scenario?
tt1375666,"01:13:26,082","01:13:28,778","When he wakes up, his mind is completely gone."
tt1375666,"01:13:28,952","01:13:33,013","Cobb, I'll still honor the arrangement."
tt1375666,"01:13:33,189","01:13:34,884","I appreciate that, Saito."
tt1375666,"01:13:35,058","01:13:39,119","But when you wake up, you won't even remember that we had an arrangement."
tt1375666,"01:13:39,295","01:13:41,320",Limbo is gonna become your reality.
tt1375666,"01:13:41,498","01:13:45,264",You're gonna be lost down there so long that you're gonna become an old man.
tt1375666,"01:13:45,735","01:13:47,066",Filled with regret?
tt1375666,"01:13:48,505","01:13:49,597",Waiting to die alone.
tt1375666,"01:13:50,273","01:13:51,365",No.
tt1375666,"01:13:51,941","01:13:53,568",I'll come back.
tt1375666,"01:13:54,377","01:13:57,039",And we'll be young men together again.
tt1375666,"01:14:03,019","01:14:04,077",Breathe.
tt1375666,"01:14:04,254","01:14:07,280",These people are gonna kill us if we don't give them the combination.

tt1375666,"01:14:09,526","01:14:13,428","They're gonna lock us in that van, and then drive it into the river."
tt1375666,"01:14:13,596","01:14:15,063",All right. What is in the safe?
tt1375666,"01:14:16,166","01:14:17,326",Something for you.
tt1375666,"01:14:17,967","01:14:22,097",Maurice always said it was his most precious gift to you.
tt1375666,"01:14:22,839","01:14:25,899",- A will. - Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.
tt1375666,"01:14:26,076","01:14:27,304",That's an alternate.
tt1375666,"01:14:27,477","01:14:29,843",This would supersede the other if you want it to.
tt1375666,"01:14:30,013","01:14:32,641",It splits up the component businesses of Fischer Morrow.
tt1375666,"01:14:32,816","01:14:36,513",It'd be the end of the entire empire as we know it.
tt1375666,"01:14:36,686","01:14:39,154",Destroying my whole inheritance?
tt1375666,"01:14:40,824","01:14:43,987",- Why would he suggest such a thing? - I just don't know.
tt1375666,"01:14:46,863","01:14:48,831","He loved you, Robert."
tt1375666,"01:14:49,399","01:14:51,026",In his own way.
tt1375666,"01:14:51,201","01:14:52,998",In his own way.
tt1375666,"01:14:54,304","01:14:55,828",At the end...
tt1375666,"01:14:56,973","01:14:59,305",...he called me in to his deathbed.
tt1375666,"01:14:59,809","01:15:01,640",He could barely speak.
tt1375666,"01:15:02,712","01:15:06,944",But he took the trouble to tell me one last thing.
tt1375666,"01:15:09,452","01:15:11,079",He pulled me close.
tt1375666,"01:15:13,757","01:15:15,850",And I could only make out...
tt1375666,"01:15:16,726","01:15:18,159",...one word.
tt1375666,"01:15:21,865","01:15:23,833","""Disappointed."""
tt1375666,"01:15:29,472","01:15:30,666",When were you in limbo?
tt1375666,"01:15:32,242","01:15:35,734",You might have the rest of the team convinced to carry on with this job.
tt1375666,"01:15:35,912","01:15:38,278",- But they don't know the truth. - Truth? What truth?
tt1375666,"01:15:38,481","01:15:42,611","The truth that, at any minute, you might bring a freight train through the wall."
tt1375666,"01:15:42,786","01:15:46,847",The truth that Mal is bursting through your subconscious.
tt1375666,"01:15:47,023","01:15:49,423","And the truth that, as we go deeper into Fischer..."
tt1375666,"01:15:49,592","01:15:51,389",...we're also going deeper into you.
tt1375666,"01:15:52,228","01:15:55,493",And I'm not sure we're gonna like what we find.
tt1375666,"01:15:59,502","01:16:00,969",We were working together.
tt1375666,"01:16:01,137","01:16:04,800",We were exploring the concept of a dream within a dream.
tt1375666,"01:16:05,008","01:16:06,270",I kept pushing things.
tt1375666,"01:16:06,442","01:16:10,105",I wanted to go deeper and deeper. I wanted to go further.
tt1375666,"01:16:10,613","01:16:15,482",I just didn't understand the concept that hours could turn into years down there...
tt1375666,"01:16:15,652","01:16:18,382",...that we could get trapped so deep...
tt1375666,"01:16:19,222","01:16:22,521",...that when we wound up on the shore of our own subconscious...
tt1375666,"01:16:23,126","01:16:25,651",...we lost sight of what was real.
tt1375666,"01:16:31,734","01:16:34,294",We created. We built the world for ourselves.
tt1375666,"01:16:35,939","01:16:37,930",We did that for years.
tt1375666,"01:16:39,075","01:16:41,043",We built our own world.
tt1375666,"01:16:42,412","01:16:44,107",How long were you stuck there?
tt1375666,"01:16:45,281","01:16:47,374",Something like 50 years.

tt1375666,"01:16:54,257","01:16:55,588",How could you stand it?
tt1375666,"01:16:55,758","01:16:58,488","It wasn't so bad at first, feeling like gods."
tt1375666,"01:16:58,661","01:17:01,687",The problem was knowing that none of it was real.
tt1375666,"01:17:01,865","01:17:06,268","Eventually, it just became impossible for me to live like that."
tt1375666,"01:17:06,436","01:17:07,835",And what about for her?
tt1375666,"01:17:11,307","01:17:15,209","She had locked something away, something deep inside her."
tt1375666,"01:17:16,613","01:17:21,846","A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget."
tt1375666,"01:17:24,787","01:17:27,278",Limbo became her reality.
tt1375666,"01:17:28,625","01:17:30,422",What happened when you woke up?
tt1375666,"01:17:30,960","01:17:34,623","Well, to wake up from that after years, after decades..."
tt1375666,"01:17:35,698","01:17:40,192",...to become old souls thrown back into youth like that?
tt1375666,"01:17:41,104","01:17:44,870",I knew something was wrong with her. She just wouldn't admit it.
tt1375666,"01:17:46,242","01:17:48,506","Eventually, she told me the truth."
tt1375666,"01:17:48,945","01:17:52,312",She was possessed by an idea.
tt1375666,"01:17:52,482","01:17:58,182",This one very simple idea that changed everything.
tt1375666,"01:17:59,322","01:18:01,790",That our world wasn't real.
tt1375666,"01:18:02,725","01:18:06,991",That she needed to wake up to come back to reality...
tt1375666,"01:18:07,530","01:18:09,896",...that in order to get back home...
tt1375666,"01:18:11,134","01:18:12,931",...we had to kill ourselves.

tt1375666,"01:23:24,714","01:23:28,275",We gotta break out of here before we're totally boxed in.
tt1375666,"01:24:03,386","01:24:04,410",Damn it.
tt1375666,"01:24:04,587","01:24:07,579","You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling."
tt1375666,"01:24:24,340","01:24:27,332",We need to shift his animosity from his father to his godfather.
tt1375666,"01:24:27,510","01:24:31,537",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:24:31,714","01:24:34,012",...whilst exposing his godfather's true nature.
tt1375666,"01:24:34,183","01:24:37,175",We should charge Fischer a lot more than Saito for this job.
tt1375666,"01:24:37,353","01:24:39,719",His security is gonna get worse as we go deeper.
tt1375666,"01:24:39,889","01:24:42,380",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:24:42,792","01:24:44,225",Who's Mr. Charles? - Bad idea.
tt1375666,"01:24:44,393","01:24:47,920",The second we get into that hotel his security's gonna be all over us.
tt1375666,"01:24:48,097","01:24:50,190",We run with Mr. Charles like on the Stein job.
tt1375666,"01:24:50,366","01:24:52,698","- You've done it before? Yeah, and it didn't work."
tt1375666,"01:24:52,868","01:24:56,360",The subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces.
tt1375666,"01:24:56,539","01:24:58,564","Excellent. But you learned a lot, right?"
tt1375666,"01:24:58,741","01:25:00,834",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:25:01,010","01:25:03,205",How about a lovely lady that I've used before?
tt1375666,"01:25:03,379","01:25:05,438","Listen to me. You drive carefully, all right?"
tt1375666,"01:25:05,614","01:25:08,082",Everything down there is gonna be unstable as hell.
tt1375666,"01:25:12,621","01:25:15,988",Don't jump too soon. We only got one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.
tt1375666,"01:25:16,158","01:25:19,457",I'll play the music to let you know it's coming. The rest is on you.
tt1375666,"01:25:19,628","01:25:21,425",- You ready? - Ready!
tt1375666,"01:25:22,665","01:25:23,757",Sweet dreams.
tt1375666,"01:25:23,933","01:25:25,833",Am I boring you?
tt1375666,"01:25:27,136","01:25:30,333",I was telling you my story. I guess it wasn't to your liking.
tt1375666,"01:25:32,174","01:25:34,836","Um, I have a lot on my mind."
tt1375666,"01:25:36,379","01:25:37,971",There goes Mr. Charles.
tt1375666,"01:25:42,685","01:25:45,313","Mr. Fischer, right?"
tt1375666,"01:25:45,488","01:25:48,980",Pleasure to see you again. Rod Green from marketing. L-
tt1375666,"01:25:49,158","01:25:50,284",Hmm.
tt1375666,"01:25:50,459","01:25:53,121",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:25:56,365","01:25:57,491",In case you get bored.
tt1375666,"01:26:02,738","01:26:04,103",Must've blown you off.
tt1375666,"01:26:04,273","01:26:07,003","That is, unless her phone number really is only six digits."
tt1375666,"01:26:09,178","01:26:13,615","Funny way to make friends, someone stealing your wallet like that."
tt1375666,"01:26:17,553","01:26:19,885",Goddamn it. The wallet alone is worth at least 500-
tt1375666,"01:26:20,055","01:26:21,181","About $500, right?"
tt1375666,"01:26:21,357","01:26:24,326",Don't worry about it. My people are already on it as we speak.
tt1375666,"01:26:24,493","01:26:26,427",Who or what is Mr. Charles?
tt1375666,"01:26:26,629","01:26:30,326",It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious.
tt1375666,"01:26:30,499","01:26:31,830",And why don't you approve?
tt1375666,"01:26:32,001","01:26:33,992",It involves telling the mark that he's dreaming...
tt1375666,"01:26:34,170","01:26:36,297",...which involves attracting a lot of attention to us.
tt1375666,"01:26:36,472","01:26:39,407",- Didn't Cobb say never to do that? - Hmm.
tt1375666,"01:26:39,575","01:26:41,338",So now you've noticed how much time...
tt1375666,"01:26:41,510","01:26:44,138",...Cobb spends doing things he says never to do.
tt1375666,"01:26:45,881","01:26:47,644","Mr. Saito, can I have a moment?"
tt1375666,"01:26:47,817","01:26:50,251","- I'm sorry, but... Hold on! Wait!"
tt1375666,"01:26:51,587","01:26:52,884",You look a bit perkier.
tt1375666,"01:26:53,055","01:26:55,387","Very amusing, Mr. Eames."
tt1375666,"01:27:01,630","01:27:03,120",Turbulence on the plane?
tt1375666,"01:27:03,299","01:27:04,994","No, it's much closer."
tt1375666,"01:27:05,167","01:27:06,828",That's Yusuf's driving.
tt1375666,"01:27:15,177","01:27:17,645","Um, I'm sorry. Who did you say you were?"
tt1375666,"01:27:17,813","01:27:19,906",Rod Green from marketing.
tt1375666,"01:27:20,082","01:27:21,674","But that's not true at all, is it?"
tt1375666,"01:27:23,786","01:27:27,244","My name is Mr. Charles. You remember me, don't you?"
tt1375666,"01:27:27,456","01:27:29,424",I'm the head of your security down here.
tt1375666,"01:27:30,693","01:27:32,627","Get out on a different floor, keep moving."
tt1375666,"01:27:32,795","01:27:35,127",Dump the wallet. Security will be looking for that.
tt1375666,"01:27:35,297","01:27:38,789",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:27:42,438","01:27:43,996","Security, huh?"
tt1375666,"01:27:46,442","01:27:48,603",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:27:48,777","01:27:53,373",I specialize in a very specific type of security.
tt1375666,"01:27:53,782","01:27:55,443",Subconscious security.
tt1375666,"01:27:55,618","01:27:57,711",You're talking about dreams?
tt1375666,"01:27:57,887","01:28:00,754","Are you talking about, um, extraction?"
tt1375666,"01:28:01,790","01:28:03,189",I am here to protect you.
tt1375666,"01:28:16,639","01:28:19,164","Mr. Fischer, I'm here to protect you in the event..."
tt1375666,"01:28:19,341","01:28:22,708",...that someone tries to access your mind through your dreams.
tt1375666,"01:28:22,878","01:28:25,506",You're not safe here.
tt1375666,"01:28:26,348","01:28:27,940",They're coming for you.
tt1375666,"01:28:46,302","01:28:48,327","Strange weather, isn't it?"
tt1375666,"01:28:53,175","01:28:54,301",You feel that?
tt1375666,"01:28:56,278","01:28:57,472",What's happening?
tt1375666,"01:28:57,646","01:29:00,877",Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention to the strangeness of the dream...
tt1375666,"01:29:01,050","01:29:03,917",...which is making his subconscious look for the dreamer.
tt1375666,"01:29:04,086","01:29:07,146","For me. Quick, give me a kiss."
tt1375666,"01:29:12,161","01:29:16,029","- They're still looking at us. - Yeah, it was worth a shot."
tt1375666,"01:29:16,699","01:29:18,724",We should probably get out of here.
tt1375666,"01:29:34,016","01:29:37,577","You feel that? You've actually been trained for this, Mr. Fischer."
tt1375666,"01:29:37,753","01:29:41,746","Pay attention to the strangeness of the weather, the shift in gravity."
tt1375666,"01:29:41,924","01:29:45,087",None of this is real. You're in a dream.
tt1375666,"01:29:49,898","01:29:52,128","Now, the easiest way for you to test yourself..."
tt1375666,"01:29:52,334","01:29:56,395",...is to try and remember how you arrived at this hotel. Can you do that?
tt1375666,"01:29:57,239","01:29:58,536","Yeah, I..."
tt1375666,"01:29:58,707","01:30:01,232","No, breathe, breathe. Remember your training."
tt1375666,"01:30:01,410","01:30:06,575","Accept the fact that you're in a dream, and I'm here to protect you. Go on."
tt1375666,"01:30:08,584","01:30:09,949",Mm-hm.
tt1375666,"01:30:12,755","01:30:14,586",- You're not real? - No.
tt1375666,"01:30:14,757","01:30:18,124",No. I'm a projection of your subconscious.
tt1375666,"01:30:18,293","01:30:20,386",I was sent here to protect you in the event...
tt1375666,"01:30:20,562","01:30:23,463",...that extractors tried to pull you into a dream.
tt1375666,"01:30:23,632","01:30:26,863","And I believe that's what's going on right now, Mr. Fischer."
tt1375666,"01:30:27,970","01:30:28,994",Yeah.
tt1375666,"01:30:29,171","01:30:30,263",Okay.
tt1375666,"01:30:31,173","01:30:32,401",Okay.
tt1375666,"01:30:35,244","01:30:37,235",Can you get me out of here?
tt1375666,"01:30:38,147","01:30:40,741",Right away. Follow me.
tt1375666,"01:30:54,963","01:30:56,294",Hold on a second.
tt1375666,"01:31:01,236","01:31:03,067",Jesus Christ! What are you doing?
tt1375666,"01:31:03,238","01:31:05,502","These men were sent here to abduct you, all right?"
tt1375666,"01:31:05,674","01:31:08,234","If you want my help, you have to remain calm."
tt1375666,"01:31:09,978","01:31:12,276","I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer."
tt1375666,"01:31:23,992","01:31:27,587","If this is a dream, I should just kill myself to wake up, right?"
tt1375666,"01:31:27,763","01:31:29,856","I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mr. Fischer."
tt1375666,"01:31:30,032","01:31:33,524","I believe they have you sedated, and if you pull that trigger..."
tt1375666,"01:31:33,702","01:31:34,862",...you may not wake up.
tt1375666,"01:31:36,004","01:31:40,304","You may go into a further dream state. Now, you know what I'm talking about."
tt1375666,"01:31:42,644","01:31:44,305",You remember the training.
tt1375666,"01:31:45,447","01:31:46,846",Remember what I said to you.
tt1375666,"01:31:47,716","01:31:48,876",Give me the gun.
tt1375666,"01:32:00,696","01:32:03,290",- This room should be directly below 528? - Yeah.
tt1375666,"01:32:12,674","01:32:14,164","Think, Mr. Fischer, think."
tt1375666,"01:32:14,343","01:32:18,177",What do you remember from before this dream?
tt1375666,"01:32:18,547","01:32:21,175","There was, um, a lot of gunfire."
tt1375666,"01:32:21,350","01:32:23,944",There was rain.
tt1375666,"01:32:24,486","01:32:26,078",Uncle Peter.
tt1375666,"01:32:26,355","01:32:29,984","- Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped. - Where were they holding you?"
tt1375666,"01:32:33,028","01:32:36,293",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:32:36,498","01:32:38,557",You're in the back of a van. Keep going.
tt1375666,"01:32:38,734","01:32:40,998","It had something to do with, um..."
tt1375666,"01:32:41,637","01:32:44,504",Something to do with a safe.
tt1375666,"01:32:45,140","01:32:46,767","God, why is it so hard to remember?"
tt1375666,"01:32:46,942","01:32:49,638",It's like trying to remember a dream after you've woken up.
tt1375666,"01:32:49,812","01:32:51,541","Listen, it takes years of practice."
tt1375666,"01:32:51,713","01:32:54,113",You and Browning have been pulled into this dream...
tt1375666,"01:32:54,283","01:32:57,047",...because they're trying to steal something from your mind.
tt1375666,"01:32:57,219","01:33:00,780",I need you to focus and try and remember what that is.
tt1375666,"01:33:00,956","01:33:02,583","What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!"
tt1375666,"01:33:02,758","01:33:06,489",A combination. They demanded the first numbers to pop into my head.
tt1375666,"01:33:06,662","01:33:09,392",They're trying to extract a number from your subconscious.
tt1375666,"01:33:09,565","01:33:13,331",It can represent anything. We're in a hotel right now.
tt1375666,"01:33:14,136","01:33:17,264","We should try hotel rooms. What was the number, Mr. Fischer?"
tt1375666,"01:33:17,439","01:33:20,272",Try and remember for me. This is very important.
tt1375666,"01:33:20,442","01:33:21,773",Five.
tt1375666,"01:33:22,744","01:33:25,178","Five, two- It was something, it was a long number."
tt1375666,"01:33:25,347","01:33:27,440",That's good. We can start there. Fifth floor.
tt1375666,"01:33:27,616","01:33:28,640",Yep.
tt1375666,"01:33:28,817","01:33:32,844",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:33:33,055","01:33:36,320","While you're all asleep in 528, I wait for Yusuf's kick."
tt1375666,"01:33:36,491","01:33:38,618",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:33:38,794","01:33:42,730","And then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge, that should be unmistakable."
tt1375666,"01:33:42,898","01:33:46,095",So we get a nice synchronized kick.
tt1375666,"01:33:46,268","01:33:48,668","If it's too soon, we won't get pulled out."
tt1375666,"01:33:48,837","01:33:52,102","But if it's too late, I won't be able to drop us."

tt1375666,"01:33:56,612","01:33:59,445",- Can't drop you without gravity. - Right.

tt1375666,"01:34:35,984","01:34:38,043",They were trying to put you under.
tt1375666,"01:34:38,487","01:34:40,546",- I'm already under. - Under again.
tt1375666,"01:34:40,722","01:34:43,282","What do you mean, a dream within a dream?"
tt1375666,"01:34:43,892","01:34:46,360",Hey. I see you've changed.
tt1375666,"01:34:46,528","01:34:48,155",I'm sorry?
tt1375666,"01:34:48,664","01:34:52,532","Oh, I'm sorry. I mistook you for a friend."
tt1375666,"01:34:52,701","01:34:53,963",Oh.
tt1375666,"01:34:54,136","01:34:56,263","Good-looking fellow, I'm sure."
tt1375666,"01:34:56,939","01:34:59,874","No, no, no. That's Fischer's projection of Browning."
tt1375666,"01:35:00,042","01:35:01,907",Let's follow him and see how he behaves.
tt1375666,"01:35:02,077","01:35:04,045",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:35:04,212","01:35:07,545",...if Fischer is starting to suspect his motives the way we want him to.

tt1375666,"01:35:28,603","01:35:30,434",The kidnappers are working for you?

tt1375666,"01:35:41,683","01:35:44,049",I'm not gonna throw away my inheritance.
tt1375666,"01:35:44,219","01:35:48,383",I couldn't let you rise to your father's last taunt.

tt1375666,"01:35:52,394","01:35:54,328",That's his last insult.
tt1375666,"01:35:54,496","01:35:58,125",A challenge for you to build something for yourself...
tt1375666,"01:35:58,300","01:36:02,100",...by telling you you're not worthy of his accomplishments.
tt1375666,"01:36:07,776","01:36:13,146","- What, but that he was, um, disappointed? - I'm sorry."
tt1375666,"01:36:14,516","01:36:17,610",But he's wrong.
tt1375666,"01:36:18,353","01:36:20,981",You can build a better company than he ever did.
tt1375666,"01:36:21,156","01:36:23,590",Mr. Fischer? He's lying.
tt1375666,"01:36:23,759","01:36:25,852","- How do you know? - Trust me, it's what I do."
tt1375666,"01:36:26,028","01:36:28,792","He's hiding something, and we need to find out what that is."
tt1375666,"01:36:29,998","01:36:33,399",I need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you.
tt1375666,"01:36:35,971","01:36:40,032",We'll enter his subconscious and find out what he doesn't want you to know.
tt1375666,"01:36:41,309","01:36:42,776",All right.
tt1375666,"01:36:48,750","01:36:50,012",He's out. - Wait.
tt1375666,"01:36:50,185","01:36:52,244",Whose subconscious are we going into exactly?
tt1375666,"01:36:52,421","01:36:53,752",We're going into Fischer's.
tt1375666,"01:36:53,922","01:36:56,618",I told him it was Browning's so he'd be a part of our team.
tt1375666,"01:36:56,792","01:36:59,124",He's gonna help us break into his own subconscious.
tt1375666,"01:36:59,294","01:37:00,852",That's right.
tt1375666,"01:37:01,029","01:37:03,088",Security's gonna run you down hard.
tt1375666,"01:37:03,265","01:37:05,597",And I will lead them on a merry chase.
tt1375666,"01:37:06,168","01:37:08,796",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:37:14,009","01:37:15,203",You good?
tt1375666,"01:37:18,380","01:37:19,711",Hey. You ready?
tt1375666,"01:37:19,881","01:37:23,476","Yes, yes. I'm fine. I'm ready."
tt1375666,"01:37:36,031","01:37:37,362",Cobb?
tt1375666,"01:37:38,033","01:37:40,467",Cobb? What's down there?
tt1375666,"01:37:43,839","01:37:46,433","Hopefully, the truth we want Fischer to learn."
tt1375666,"01:37:46,608","01:37:48,508","I mean, what's down there for you?"
tt1375666,"01:40:25,100","01:40:26,863",Did you see that?
tt1375666,"01:40:45,353","01:40:47,184","Eames, this is your dream."
tt1375666,"01:40:47,355","01:40:50,449","I need you to draw the security away from the complex, understand?"
tt1375666,"01:40:50,625","01:40:52,422",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:40:52,594","01:40:55,062","If I know the route, everything could be compromised."
tt1375666,"01:40:55,230","01:40:57,755","- I designed the place. No, you're with me."
tt1375666,"01:40:57,932","01:40:59,456",I could do it.
tt1375666,"01:40:59,901","01:41:02,335",All right. Brief him on the route into the complex.
tt1375666,"01:41:02,504","01:41:06,702","- Fischer, you'll be going with him. - All right. What about you?"
tt1375666,"01:41:06,875","01:41:09,708",You keep this live. I'll be listening in the whole time.
tt1375666,"01:41:09,878","01:41:14,008",The windows on that upper floor are big enough for me to cover you from that tower.
tt1375666,"01:41:14,182","01:41:15,479",You're not coming in?
tt1375666,"01:41:15,650","01:41:17,982",In order to find out the truth about your father...
tt1375666,"01:41:18,153","01:41:21,179",...you're gonna need to break into Browning's mind on your own.
tt1375666,"01:41:22,057","01:41:23,524","Come on, Fischer!"
tt1375666,"01:42:18,613","01:42:22,276","- Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm! - Go, go, go!"
tt1375666,"01:42:22,450","01:42:23,974",Move!
tt1375666,"01:42:25,520","01:42:26,578",Go!
tt1375666,"01:42:41,803","01:42:42,827",Sod it.
tt1375666,"01:42:54,015","01:42:55,676",I hope you're ready.
tt1375666,"01:43:04,426","01:43:06,189","No, it's too soon."
tt1375666,"01:43:12,700","01:43:13,894","Cobb, do you hear that?"
tt1375666,"01:43:14,068","01:43:17,629","I first noticed it about 20 minutes ago, I thought it was the wind up here."
tt1375666,"01:43:18,173","01:43:20,664","Yeah, I hear it. It's music."
tt1375666,"01:43:20,842","01:43:22,241","So, what do we do?"
tt1375666,"01:43:22,410","01:43:23,809",We move fast.
tt1375666,"01:43:29,317","01:43:31,547",Yusuf's 10 seconds from the jump.
tt1375666,"01:43:33,421","01:43:35,787",Which gives Arthur three minutes.
tt1375666,"01:43:36,724","01:43:38,817",- Hey! - That's him!
tt1375666,"01:43:39,494","01:43:41,223",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:43:41,396","01:43:44,661",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:43:44,833","01:43:47,700","Then they need a new route, a more direct route."
tt1375666,"01:43:58,913","01:44:00,540",It's designed as a labyrinth.
tt1375666,"01:44:00,715","01:44:03,183",There must be access routes that cut through the maze.
tt1375666,"01:44:03,351","01:44:04,943",Eames?
tt1375666,"01:44:28,042","01:44:29,304",Did Eames add any features?
tt1375666,"01:44:29,477","01:44:30,944",I don't think I should tell you.
tt1375666,"01:44:31,112","01:44:33,410",We don't have time for this. Did he add anything?
tt1375666,"01:44:33,848","01:44:36,612",He added an air-duct system that can cut through the maze.
tt1375666,"01:44:36,784","01:44:37,978",Good. Explain it to them.
tt1375666,"01:44:38,152","01:44:39,380",Saito? - Go ahead.
tt1375666,"01:45:12,720","01:45:14,278",Paradox.
tt1375666,"01:46:24,158","01:46:26,217",What was that? - The kick.
tt1375666,"01:46:26,828","01:46:28,728","Cobb! Cobb, did we miss it?"
tt1375666,"01:46:28,896","01:46:30,591","Yeah, we missed it."
tt1375666,"01:46:30,765","01:46:31,959",Man.
tt1375666,"01:46:32,133","01:46:36,433",Couldn't someone have dreamt up a goddamn beach? Huh?
tt1375666,"01:46:36,604","01:46:37,866",Uh-huh.
tt1375666,"01:46:38,606","01:46:40,767","Well, what the hell do we do now?"
tt1375666,"01:46:40,942","01:46:42,773",We finish the job before the next kick.
tt1375666,"01:46:42,944","01:46:45,037",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:47:07,902","01:47:11,338","If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again."
tt1375666,"01:47:11,506","01:47:13,337","If you need help, hang up..."
tt1375666,"01:47:13,574","01:47:16,873",How do I drop you without gravity?
tt1375666,"01:47:19,380","01:47:22,042","Arthur has a couple minutes, and we have about 20."
tt1375666,"01:47:45,473","01:47:47,134",You okay?
tt1375666,"01:47:51,612","01:47:55,480",Run! Turn around! Move to base! Move to base!
tt1375666,"01:47:55,650","01:47:57,174","Go, go, go!"
tt1375666,"01:47:59,353","01:48:00,513",There's something wrong.
tt1375666,"01:48:00,688","01:48:03,020","They're heading your way, like they know something."
tt1375666,"01:48:04,258","01:48:06,488","Just buy us more time, all right?"
tt1375666,"01:48:06,661","01:48:08,492",- Come on! - On my way.
tt1375666,"01:48:08,663","01:48:10,358",Come on! Move!
tt1375666,"01:49:34,549","01:49:36,073",All right.
tt1375666,"01:49:48,262","01:49:51,060",Okay. That's the antechamber outside the strong room.
tt1375666,"01:49:51,232","01:49:54,724",- Does the strong room have windows? - It wouldn't be very strong if it did.
tt1375666,"01:49:54,902","01:49:57,132",Let's hope Fischer likes what he finds in there.
tt1375666,"01:49:58,773","01:50:02,106",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:50:02,276","01:50:05,643",- Are you destroying parts of his mind? - No. They're just projections.
tt1375666,"01:50:31,939","01:50:33,668","- We're here. - You're clear, but hurry."
tt1375666,"01:50:33,841","01:50:35,672",There's an entire army headed your way.
tt1375666,"01:51:02,503","01:51:03,868",I'm in.
tt1375666,"01:51:09,176","01:51:10,302",There he is.
tt1375666,"01:51:52,954","01:51:55,650","- There's someone in there. - Fischer, it's a trap. Get out."
tt1375666,"01:51:56,824","01:51:59,384","Come on. Come on, a little lower."
tt1375666,"01:52:05,132","01:52:06,292",Cobb.
tt1375666,"01:52:06,934","01:52:09,459","No, she is not real."
tt1375666,"01:52:10,071","01:52:11,299",How do you know that?
tt1375666,"01:52:11,472","01:52:15,101",She is just a projection. Fischer. Fischer is real.
tt1375666,"01:52:19,113","01:52:20,637",Hello.
tt1375666,"01:52:25,319","01:52:28,516","Eames! Eames, get to the antechamber now!"
tt1375666,"01:53:12,433","01:53:15,300",What happened? - Mal killed Fischer.
tt1375666,"01:53:17,571","01:53:19,596",I couldn't shoot her.
tt1375666,"01:53:20,274","01:53:23,641",There's no use in reviving him. His mind's already trapped down there.
tt1375666,"01:53:23,811","01:53:24,869",It's all over.
tt1375666,"01:53:26,614","01:53:28,241","So that's it, then? We failed?"
tt1375666,"01:53:28,883","01:53:31,044",We're done. I'm sorry.
tt1375666,"01:53:34,922","01:53:37,550","It's not me that doesn't get back to my family, is it?"
tt1375666,"01:53:38,259","01:53:42,161",Shame. I wanted to know what was gonna happen in there. I swear we had this.
tt1375666,"01:53:42,329","01:53:44,388",Let's set the charges.
tt1375666,"01:53:46,233","01:53:47,723","No, there's still another way."
tt1375666,"01:53:49,036","01:53:52,437",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:53:52,606","01:53:55,439","No, but there will be enough time down there."
tt1375666,"01:53:56,577","01:53:57,669",And we will find him.
tt1375666,"01:53:57,845","01:54:01,781","Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in, just use the defibrillator to revive him."
tt1375666,"01:54:01,949","01:54:04,850",We can give him his own kick down below.
tt1375666,"01:54:05,886","01:54:07,581","Look, you get him in there."
tt1375666,"01:54:07,755","01:54:10,622","As soon as the music ends, you blow up the hospital..."
tt1375666,"01:54:10,791","01:54:13,589",...and we all ride the kick back up the layers.
tt1375666,"01:54:14,795","01:54:19,562","It's worth a shot, if Saito can hold the guards off while I set the charges."
tt1375666,"01:54:19,733","01:54:21,826","Saito will never make it, will he?"
tt1375666,"01:54:23,137","01:54:26,334","- Cobb, come on. We've gotta try this. - Go for it."
tt1375666,"01:54:26,507","01:54:29,442","If you are not back before the kick, I am gone with or without you."
tt1375666,"01:54:29,610","01:54:32,841",She's right. She's right. Come on. Let's go.
tt1375666,"01:54:37,084","01:54:39,279",Can I trust you to do what needs to happen here?
tt1375666,"01:54:39,453","01:54:40,647",Mal's gonna be down there.
tt1375666,"01:54:40,821","01:54:43,255",I know where to find her. She'll have Fischer.
tt1375666,"01:54:43,424","01:54:47,326",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:54:47,495","01:54:49,656",She wants me back down there with her.
tt1375666,"01:55:16,423","01:55:17,447",All right?
tt1375666,"01:55:24,698","01:55:27,360",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:55:28,169","01:55:30,103",And this is where she'll be.
tt1375666,"01:55:30,905","01:55:32,395",Come on.
tt1375666,"01:56:18,886","01:56:21,354",Saito. Saito.
tt1375666,"01:56:21,789","01:56:25,748","I need you to take care of Fischer while I go set some charges, okay?"
tt1375666,"01:56:25,926","01:56:29,362",No room for tourists on these jobs.
tt1375666,"01:56:31,999","01:56:33,159",Don't be silly.
tt1375666,"01:57:05,666","01:57:07,725",You built all this? This is incredible.
tt1375666,"01:57:08,202","01:57:10,227",We built for years.
tt1375666,"01:57:11,272","01:57:13,263",Then we started in on the memories.
tt1375666,"01:57:20,314","01:57:21,713",This way.
tt1375666,"01:58:03,390","01:58:05,483",This was our neighborhood.
tt1375666,"01:58:05,659","01:58:07,991",Places from our past.
tt1375666,"01:58:08,162","01:58:09,925",That was our first apartment.
tt1375666,"01:58:10,097","01:58:12,327",Then we moved to that building right there.
tt1375666,"01:58:12,499","01:58:15,024","After Mal became pregnant, that became our home."
tt1375666,"01:58:15,202","01:58:18,000",You reconstructed all of this from memory?
tt1375666,"01:58:18,172","01:58:20,436","Like I told you, we had lots of time."
tt1375666,"01:58:20,607","01:58:22,199",What is that?
tt1375666,"01:58:23,744","01:58:25,507",That's the house Mal grew up in.
tt1375666,"01:58:25,679","01:58:28,113",#NAME?
tt1375666,"01:58:28,449","01:58:29,473",Come on.
tt1375666,"01:58:29,650","01:58:32,983","We both wanted to live in a house, but we loved this type of building."
tt1375666,"01:58:33,153","01:58:36,088","In the real world, we'd have to choose, but not here."
tt1375666,"01:59:16,663","01:59:18,688",How are we gonna bring Fischer back?
tt1375666,"01:59:19,099","01:59:21,533",We're gonna have to come up with some kind of a kick.
tt1375666,"01:59:21,702","01:59:23,101",What?
tt1375666,"01:59:24,104","01:59:25,196",I'm gonna improvise.
tt1375666,"01:59:25,372","01:59:30,036","Listen, there's something you should know about me. About tt1375666."
tt1375666,"01:59:43,123","01:59:46,991",An idea is like a virus. Resilient.
tt1375666,"01:59:47,828","01:59:49,386",Highly contagious.
tt1375666,"01:59:49,563","01:59:52,896",And the smallest seed of an idea can grow.
tt1375666,"01:59:53,967","01:59:55,935",It can grow to define...
tt1375666,"01:59:56,970","01:59:58,528",...or destroy you.
tt1375666,"02:00:01,675","02:00:04,439","The smallest idea, such as:"
tt1375666,"02:00:05,045","02:00:07,411","""Your world is not real."""
tt1375666,"02:00:07,681","02:00:11,447",Simple little thought that changes everything.
tt1375666,"02:00:12,686","02:00:17,180",So certain of your world. Of what's real.
tt1375666,"02:00:17,357","02:00:19,154",Do you think he is?
tt1375666,"02:00:20,961","02:00:23,862",Or do you think he's as lost as I was?
tt1375666,"02:00:24,998","02:00:26,488","I know what's real, Mal."
tt1375666,"02:00:28,569","02:00:30,867",No creeping doubts?
tt1375666,"02:00:31,572","02:00:34,200","Not feeling persecuted, Dom?"
tt1375666,"02:00:34,508","02:00:35,839",Chased around the globe...
tt1375666,"02:00:36,009","02:00:38,671",...by anonymous corporations and police forces...
tt1375666,"02:00:38,846","02:00:41,474",...the way the projections persecute the dreamer?
tt1375666,"02:00:43,083","02:00:44,573",Admit it.
tt1375666,"02:00:45,886","02:00:48,719",You don't believe in one reality anymore.
tt1375666,"02:00:48,889","02:00:50,413",So choose.
tt1375666,"02:00:50,591","02:00:52,855",Choose to be here.
tt1375666,"02:00:53,360","02:00:54,850",Choose me.
tt1375666,"02:01:20,721","02:01:21,983",You know what I have to do.
tt1375666,"02:01:22,155","02:01:24,817",I have to get back to our children because you left them.
tt1375666,"02:01:26,159","02:01:27,683",Because you left us.
tt1375666,"02:01:27,861","02:01:29,658",- You're wrong. I'm not wrong.
tt1375666,"02:01:29,830","02:01:31,855",You're confused.
tt1375666,"02:01:32,966","02:01:35,025",Our children are here.
tt1375666,"02:01:35,802","02:01:39,067","And you'd like to see their faces again, wouldn't you?"
tt1375666,"02:01:39,239","02:01:42,299","Yes, but I'm gonna see them up above, Mal."
tt1375666,"02:01:55,956","02:01:57,947",Up above?
tt1375666,"02:01:58,859","02:02:02,488",Listen to yourself. These are our children.
tt1375666,"02:02:03,030","02:02:04,395",Watch.
tt1375666,"02:02:04,898","02:02:06,593",James? Phillipa?
tt1375666,"02:02:06,767","02:02:09,201","Don't do this, Mal. Please. Those aren't my children."
tt1375666,"02:02:09,369","02:02:11,837","You keep telling yourself that, but you don't believe it."
tt1375666,"02:02:12,005","02:02:13,905","- No, I know it. - What if you're wrong?"
tt1375666,"02:02:14,308","02:02:16,606",What if I'm what's real?
tt1375666,"02:02:17,811","02:02:20,041",You keep telling yourself what you know.
tt1375666,"02:02:21,615","02:02:23,845",But what do you believe?
tt1375666,"02:02:24,818","02:02:26,046",What do you feel?
tt1375666,"02:02:28,188","02:02:29,621",Guilt.
tt1375666,"02:02:30,824","02:02:33,054","I feel guilt, Mal."
tt1375666,"02:02:33,594","02:02:37,530","And no matter what I do, no matter how hopeless I am..."
tt1375666,"02:02:37,698","02:02:41,964","...no matter how confused, that guilt is always there..."
tt1375666,"02:02:42,135","02:02:44,660",...reminding me of the truth.
tt1375666,"02:02:45,172","02:02:46,469",What truth?
tt1375666,"02:02:48,909","02:02:54,142",That the idea that caused you to question your reality came from me.
tt1375666,"02:02:57,517","02:03:00,645",You planted the idea in my mind?
tt1375666,"02:03:02,155","02:03:03,645",What is she talking about?
tt1375666,"02:03:04,558","02:03:09,825",The reason I knew tt1375666 was possible was because I did it to her first.
tt1375666,"02:03:10,864","02:03:13,833",#NAME?
tt1375666,"02:03:14,568","02:03:16,058",We were lost in here.
tt1375666,"02:03:17,004","02:03:21,634","I knew we needed to escape, but she wouldn't accept it."
tt1375666,"02:03:24,845","02:03:30,511","She had locked something away, something deep inside."
tt1375666,"02:03:31,284","02:03:35,414","A truth that she had once known, but chose to forget."
tt1375666,"02:03:36,390","02:03:38,517",And she couldn't break free.
tt1375666,"02:03:41,228","02:03:43,958",So I decided to search for it.
tt1375666,"02:03:44,531","02:03:49,400",I went deep into the recess of her mind and found that secret place.
tt1375666,"02:03:49,569","02:03:51,469",And I broke in...
tt1375666,"02:03:52,039","02:03:54,200",...and I planted an idea.
tt1375666,"02:03:54,941","02:03:58,707",A simple little idea that would change everything.
tt1375666,"02:04:03,950","02:04:06,316",That her world wasn't real.
tt1375666,"02:04:19,132","02:04:22,329",That death was the only escape.
tt1375666,"02:04:29,743","02:04:31,506",You're waiting for a train.
tt1375666,"02:04:33,814","02:04:36,544",A train that'll take you far away.
tt1375666,"02:04:37,718","02:04:40,710",You know where you hope this train will take you...
tt1375666,"02:04:41,822","02:04:43,847",...but you can't know for sure.
tt1375666,"02:04:45,025","02:04:46,549",Yet it doesn't matter.
tt1375666,"02:04:47,994","02:04:51,157","- Now, tell me why! - Because you'll be together!"
tt1375666,"02:04:55,502","02:04:59,563",But I never knew that that idea would grow in her mind like a cancer...
tt1375666,"02:04:59,740","02:05:02,140",...that even after she woke...
tt1375666,"02:05:05,045","02:05:07,513",That even after you came back to reality...
tt1375666,"02:05:10,450","02:05:13,419",...that you'd continue to believe your world wasn't real.
tt1375666,"02:05:16,189","02:05:18,589",That death was the only escape.
tt1375666,"02:05:18,759","02:05:21,421","Mal, no! Jesus!"
tt1375666,"02:05:21,595","02:05:25,292",#NAME?
tt1375666,"02:05:25,465","02:05:26,864",You betrayed me.
tt1375666,"02:05:27,701","02:05:31,398",But you can make amends. You can still keep your promise.
tt1375666,"02:05:31,571","02:05:34,597","We can still be together, right here..."
tt1375666,"02:05:34,775","02:05:37,243",...in the world we built together.
tt1375666,"02:06:58,058","02:07:00,390","Cobb, we need to get Fischer."
tt1375666,"02:07:01,261","02:07:02,558",You can't have him.
tt1375666,"02:07:03,597","02:07:07,033",#NAME?
tt1375666,"02:07:11,504","02:07:13,335",Fischer is on the porch.
tt1375666,"02:07:13,907","02:07:16,501","- Go check he's alive, Ariadne. - Cobb, you can't do this."
tt1375666,"02:07:16,676","02:07:19,304",Go check he's alive right now. Do it.
tt1375666,"02:07:34,961","02:07:38,055","He's here! And it's time, but you have to come now!"
tt1375666,"02:07:38,231","02:07:41,894","You take Fischer with you, all right? - You can't stay here to be with her."
tt1375666,"02:07:44,471","02:07:47,167",I'm not. Saito's dead by now.
tt1375666,"02:07:47,340","02:07:50,832",That means he's down here somewhere. That means I have to find him.
tt1375666,"02:07:52,846","02:07:55,940","I can't stay with her anymore, because she doesn't exist."
tt1375666,"02:07:56,116","02:07:59,517",I'm the only thing you do believe in anymore.
tt1375666,"02:07:59,686","02:08:01,017",No.
tt1375666,"02:08:02,188","02:08:03,621",I wish.
tt1375666,"02:08:05,225","02:08:07,716","I wish more than anything, but..."
tt1375666,"02:08:08,828","02:08:11,558",...I can't imagine you with all your complexity...
tt1375666,"02:08:11,731","02:08:14,256","...all your perfection, all your imperfection."
tt1375666,"02:08:15,368","02:08:16,392",#NAME?
tt1375666,"02:08:16,569","02:08:18,400",Look at you.
tt1375666,"02:08:19,639","02:08:24,576",You're just a shade. You're just a shade of my real wife.
tt1375666,"02:08:25,011","02:08:27,639","And you were the best that I could do, but..."
tt1375666,"02:08:28,481","02:08:30,915","...I'm sorry, you're just not good enough."
tt1375666,"02:08:31,084","02:08:32,711",Does this feel real?

tt1375666,"02:09:51,598","02:09:53,691",I know you were disappointed...
tt1375666,"02:09:54,501","02:09:55,866",...I couldn't be you.
tt1375666,"02:09:56,269","02:09:57,759",No.
tt1375666,"02:09:58,271","02:09:59,499","No, no, no."
tt1375666,"02:10:00,540","02:10:02,531",I was disappointed...
tt1375666,"02:10:04,277","02:10:06,211",...that you tried.
tt1375666,"02:10:29,469","02:10:31,130",What?
tt1375666,"02:10:40,580","02:10:41,706","Come on, come on."
tt1375666,"02:11:11,945","02:11:13,435",Dad?
tt1375666,"02:11:51,785","02:11:54,845","That's the kick, Ariadne! You have to go now!"
tt1375666,"02:12:07,700","02:12:11,136",Don't lose yourself! Find Saito and bring him back!
tt1375666,"02:12:11,304","02:12:12,965",I will!
tt1375666,"02:12:52,712","02:12:55,875",You remember when you asked me to marry you?
tt1375666,"02:12:56,049","02:12:57,141",Yes.
tt1375666,"02:12:57,317","02:13:00,377",You said you dreamt that we'd grow old together.
tt1375666,"02:13:03,089","02:13:04,579",But we did.
tt1375666,"02:13:06,526","02:13:08,892",We did. You don't remember?
tt1375666,"02:13:13,566","02:13:16,399",I miss you more than I can bear...
tt1375666,"02:13:18,771","02:13:20,762",...but we had our time together.
tt1375666,"02:13:22,108","02:13:24,167",And I have to let you go.
tt1375666,"02:13:26,279","02:13:28,076",I have to let you go.
tt1375666,"02:14:19,332","02:14:20,629","I'm sorry, Robert."
tt1375666,"02:14:48,294","02:14:51,957","You know, the will means that Dad wanted me to be my own man..."
tt1375666,"02:14:53,032","02:14:55,057",...not just to live for him.
tt1375666,"02:14:56,669","02:14:59,194","That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter."
tt1375666,"02:15:08,982","02:15:10,210",What happened?

tt1375666,"02:15:20,393","02:15:22,224","No, he'll be all right."
tt1375666,"02:15:38,244","02:15:40,212",Have you come to kill me?
tt1375666,"02:15:44,484","02:15:46,952",I'm waiting for someone.
tt1375666,"02:15:51,424","02:15:54,188",Someone from a half-remembered dream.
tt1375666,"02:15:56,929","02:15:58,328",Cobb?
tt1375666,"02:16:00,266","02:16:02,029",Impossible.
tt1375666,"02:16:02,568","02:16:05,162",We were young men together.
tt1375666,"02:16:06,773","02:16:09,105",I'm an old man.
tt1375666,"02:16:10,343","02:16:12,402",Filled with regret.
tt1375666,"02:16:15,548","02:16:18,244",Waiting to die alone.
tt1375666,"02:16:21,421","02:16:23,582",I've come back for you.
tt1375666,"02:16:26,859","02:16:30,727",To remind you of something.
tt1375666,"02:16:34,000","02:16:36,366",Something you once knew.
tt1375666,"02:16:39,238","02:16:41,468",That this world is not real.
tt1375666,"02:16:46,379","02:16:50,873",To convince me to honor our arrangement?
tt1375666,"02:16:51,717","02:16:54,481","To take a leap of faith, yes."
tt1375666,"02:17:00,593","02:17:01,924",Come back...
tt1375666,"02:17:04,464","02:17:07,831",...so we can be young men together again.
tt1375666,"02:17:11,604","02:17:13,572",Come back with me.
tt1375666,"02:17:16,676","02:17:18,109",Come back.
tt1375666,"02:17:27,854","02:17:29,549","Hot towel, sir?"
tt1375666,"02:17:30,189","02:17:33,056",We'll be landing in Los Angeles in about 20 minutes.

tt1375666,"02:20:31,237","02:20:32,829",Look what I've been building!
tt1375666,"02:20:33,005","02:20:36,702",- What are you building? We're building a house on the cliff!

tt1375666,"02:20:39,912","02:20:42,472","Let's go. Come on, Daddy!"
tt0816692,"00:00:58,717","00:01:02,717",
tt0816692,"00:01:14,657","00:01:17,203",My dad was a farmer.
tt0816692,"00:01:18,098","00:01:21,270",Like everybody else back then.
tt0816692,"00:01:22,926","00:01:25,125",Of course he didn't start that way.
tt0816692,"00:01:30,453","00:01:32,607",The computer says you're too tight.
tt0816692,"00:01:32,716","00:01:35,568","No, I got this! -Crossing the Straits."
tt0816692,"00:01:38,345","00:01:40,226",I've got to shut it down Cooper. -Heyyy.
tt0816692,"00:01:41,543","00:01:44,279","Shutting all down... -Hey, we do not have to shut down  anything!"
tt0816692,"00:01:48,279","00:01:49,339",Dad?
tt0816692,"00:01:54,771","00:01:58,747",Sorry Murph. Go back to bed babe.
tt0816692,"00:01:58,900","00:02:00,458",I thought you were the ghost.
tt0816692,"00:02:03,017","00:02:07,082",There's no such thing as a ghost babe. -Grandpa says that you can get ghosts.
tt0816692,"00:02:08,349","00:02:10,854","No, that's because grandpa is too close to..."
tt0816692,"00:02:10,969","00:02:13,530",...being one himself. Go back to bed.
tt0816692,"00:02:13,716","00:02:15,577",Were you dreaming about the crash?
tt0816692,"00:02:16,875","00:02:19,465",Get your butt back in bed Murph.
tt0816692,"00:02:45,531","00:02:48,068",The wheat had died.
tt0816692,"00:02:48,179","00:02:52,224",The blight came and we had to burn it. We still had corn.
tt0816692,"00:02:52,304","00:02:57,141",We had acres of corn. But mostly we had dust.
tt0816692,"00:02:59,680","00:03:02,317",I guess I can't describe it. It was just constant.
tt0816692,"00:03:02,428","00:03:06,801","Just that, steady blow of dirt."
tt0816692,"00:03:08,279","00:03:11,245",We wore little strips of sheet...
tt0816692,"00:03:11,362","00:03:16,312",...sometimes over our nose and mouth. So we wouldn't breathe so much of it.
tt0816692,"00:03:18,290","00:03:22,216",Well when we set the table we always set the plate upside down.
tt0816692,"00:03:22,367","00:03:24,938","Glasses or cups, whatever it was, upside down."
tt0816692,"00:03:30,482","00:03:34,570","Shake a leg. Murph, get your move on. -One o'clock today, you and me..."
tt0816692,"00:03:34,570","00:03:38,146","...in the barn, Herbicide Resistance 101, check? -Yessir."
tt0816692,"00:03:39,841","00:03:41,059",Not at the table Murph!
tt0816692,"00:03:42,081","00:03:43,761","Dad, can you fix this?"
tt0816692,"00:03:45,164","00:03:48,189",What the heck did you do to my lander? -It wasn't me.
tt0816692,"00:03:48,268","00:03:51,945",Let me guess. It was your ghost. -It knocked it off my shelf.
tt0816692,"00:03:52,019","00:03:54,753",It also knocks the books off. -There's no such thing as ghosts dumbass.
tt0816692,"00:03:54,866","00:03:57,030","Hey. -I looked it up, it's called a poltergeist."
tt0816692,"00:03:57,109","00:04:00,740","Dad, tell her. -Well, that's not very scientific Murph."
tt0816692,"00:04:00,853","00:04:04,637",You said that science was about admitting what we don't know. -She's got you there.
tt0816692,"00:04:04,750","00:04:06,841","Hey, start looking after all our stuff."
tt0816692,"00:04:08,500","00:04:09,580",Coop.
tt0816692,"00:04:11,852","00:04:14,373","Alright Murph, you wanna talk science?"
tt0816692,"00:04:14,913","00:04:18,846","Don't just tell me that you're afraid of some ghost. No, you gotta go further."
tt0816692,"00:04:18,959","00:04:21,079","You have to record the facts, analyze..."
tt0816692,"00:04:21,188","00:04:25,391",...get to the how and the why and present your conclusions. Deal?
tt0816692,"00:04:25,504","00:04:27,765",Deal. -All right!
tt0816692,"00:04:29,626","00:04:32,292",Have a good day at school. -Hold up.
tt0816692,"00:04:32,364","00:04:36,636","Parent-Teacher conferences, parent, not grandparent."
tt0816692,"00:04:39,510","00:04:43,625",Slow down turbo. That's not a dust storm.
tt0816692,"00:04:43,731","00:04:46,708",Nelson's torching his whole crop. -Blight?
tt0816692,"00:04:46,828","00:04:51,364",They're saying it's the last harvest for okra. Ever.
tt0816692,"00:04:53,249","00:04:58,147",He should have planted corn like the rest of us. -Now you be nice to that Miss Hanley.
tt0816692,"00:04:58,260","00:05:00,603",She's single. -Well what's that supposed to mean?
tt0816692,"00:05:00,713","00:05:03,977",Repopulating the Earth. -Start pulling your weight young man.
tt0816692,"00:05:04,053","00:05:08,176",Why don't you start minding your own business? Old man!
tt0816692,"00:05:15,284","00:05:16,767",All right Murph give me second.
tt0816692,"00:05:18,298","00:05:21,771","Aha,....thirrrd."
tt0816692,"00:05:22,781","00:05:26,707",Find a gear dumbass. -Grind it! -Shut it Tom!
tt0816692,"00:05:27,611","00:05:30,504","Whatcha do Murph? -Ahh, she didn't do nothing."
tt0816692,"00:05:30,587","00:05:34,172",Blew a tire is all. -Murphy's Law. -Shut up!
tt0816692,"00:05:34,253","00:05:37,076",Grab the spare Tom. -That is the spare.
tt0816692,"00:05:37,185","00:05:40,278",Get the patch kit.
tt0816692,"00:05:41,765","00:05:43,895",And how am I supposed to patch it out here?
tt0816692,"00:05:43,968","00:05:47,372",You'll have to figure it out. I'm not always gonna be here to help you.
tt0816692,"00:05:54,874","00:05:57,767",What's goin' on Murph?
tt0816692,"00:05:57,842","00:06:02,567",Why did you and mom name me after something that's bad? -No we didn't?
tt0816692,"00:06:02,641","00:06:04,473",Murphy's Law?
tt0816692,"00:06:05,847","00:06:08,721",Murphy's Law doesn't mean that something bad...
tt0816692,"00:06:08,831","00:06:11,637",...will happen. What it means is whatever can happen...
tt0816692,"00:06:11,638","00:06:15,346",...will happen. And that sounded just fine with us.
tt0816692,"00:06:21,293","00:06:23,131",Get in.
tt0816692,"00:06:24,612","00:06:25,838","Get in, let's go."
tt0816692,"00:06:27,216","00:06:29,701",What about the flat tire?
tt0816692,"00:06:32,347","00:06:33,223",Yes.
tt0816692,"00:06:47,437","00:06:52,208",It is an Indian Air Force drone. Solar cells could power an entire farm.
tt0816692,"00:06:52,320","00:06:53,221",Take the wheel Tom.
tt0816692,"00:06:58,482","00:07:01,366","Go, go go!"
tt0816692,"00:07:01,455","00:07:03,075",Keep it pointed at that.
tt0816692,"00:07:11,073","00:07:14,007","Faster Tom, we're losing it. -Yes."
tt0816692,"00:07:14,085","00:07:15,956",Point right at it.
tt0816692,"00:07:17,219","00:07:21,361","Hang on, here we go, here we go."
tt0816692,"00:07:29,433","00:07:31,405",Nice driving Tom.
tt0816692,"00:07:38,050","00:07:42,280","Dad? -Almost got it, don't stop, don't stop."
tt0816692,"00:07:42,389","00:07:45,332",Dad?! Tom!!!
tt0816692,"00:07:50,112","00:07:52,092",Wha..? You told me to keep driving.
tt0816692,"00:07:53,533","00:07:57,566",Well I guess that answers the ol' 'if I ask you to drive off a cliff' scenario.
tt0816692,"00:08:00,344","00:08:03,662",We lost it. -No we didn't!
tt0816692,"00:08:15,414","00:08:18,010",Wanna give it a whirl?
tt0816692,"00:08:24,455","00:08:25,391",
tt0816692,"00:07:41,735","00:07:42,971",
tt0816692,"00:07:43,871","00:07:47,400","Let's land it down there, right at the edge of the reservoir."
tt0816692,"00:08:40,465","00:08:42,082",Nicely done!
tt0816692,"00:08:44,200","00:08:46,975",How long do you think it's been up there?
tt0816692,"00:08:47,053","00:08:50,925","Delhi Mission Control went down same as ours, 10 years ago."
tt0816692,"00:08:52,299","00:08:53,701",So for 10 years?
tt0816692,"00:08:56,615","00:08:59,354",Why'd it come down so low? -I don't know.
tt0816692,"00:08:59,466","00:09:03,604",Maybe the sun cooked it's brain or it was looking for something. -What?
tt0816692,"00:09:03,717","00:09:07,150",Give me that large flatblade Maybe some kind of signal.
tt0816692,"00:09:07,259","00:09:08,441",I don't know.
tt0816692,"00:09:13,532","00:09:15,073",What are you gonna do with it?
tt0816692,"00:09:15,153","00:09:19,009",I'm gonna give it something socially responsible to do...
tt0816692,"00:09:19,044","00:09:23,574","...like driving a combine. -Can't we just, let it go?"
tt0816692,"00:09:25,151","00:09:27,027",It wasn't hurting anybody.
tt0816692,"00:09:29,079","00:09:33,172","Listen, this thing needs to learn how to adapt Murph, like the rest of us."
tt0816692,"00:09:37,351","00:09:40,989",So how's this work? Do you guys come with? -I've got class.
tt0816692,"00:09:41,067","00:09:43,554","This one, needs to wait."
tt0816692,"00:09:43,627","00:09:47,782",What did you do? -They'll tell you about it when you get in there.
tt0816692,"00:09:47,859","00:09:50,353",Well am I gonna be mad? -Not with me.
tt0816692,"00:09:50,462","00:09:51,756","Just please, try not to."
tt0816692,"00:09:51,872","00:09:55,766","Hey, relax....I got this."
tt0816692,"00:10:00,253","00:10:03,647","You're late Coop. -Yeah, we had a flat."
tt0816692,"00:10:03,717","00:10:07,684",And I guess you had to stop off at Asian fighter plane store.
tt0816692,"00:10:07,793","00:10:11,034","No actually sir, that's a, that's a surveillance drone."
tt0816692,"00:10:11,144","00:10:14,947",With outstanding solar cells. It's Indian. -Take a seat.
tt0816692,"00:10:16,535","00:10:21,241","So, we got Tom's scores back."
tt0816692,"00:10:21,352","00:10:26,074",He's gonna make an excellent farmer. -Yeah he's got a knack for it.
tt0816692,"00:10:26,183","00:10:27,448",What about college?
tt0816692,"00:10:27,566","00:10:31,808",Well the university only takes a handful. They don't really have the resources.
tt0816692,"00:10:31,880","00:10:36,800",-I still pay my taxes. Where does that money go? There's no more armies.
tt0816692,"00:10:36,911","00:10:38,802","Well, they don't go to the university."
tt0816692,"00:10:39,924","00:10:41,655","Look Coop, you have to be realistic."
tt0816692,"00:10:41,766","00:10:46,133",You're ruling my son out for college now? The kid's 15.
tt0816692,"00:10:46,279","00:10:50,788",Tom's score simply isn't high enough. -What's your waistline?
tt0816692,"00:10:50,860","00:10:55,650","How about 32, about 33 inseam? -I'm not sure I see where you're getting at."
tt0816692,"00:10:55,760","00:10:57,896",You're telling me it takes two numbers to measure your own ass...
tt0816692,"00:10:57,897","00:11:00,348",...but only one to measure my son's future?
tt0816692,"00:11:00,420","00:11:04,058","Come on, you're a well-educated man Coop..."
tt0816692,"00:11:04,170","00:11:06,407",...and a trained pilot. -And an engineer.
tt0816692,"00:11:06,442","00:11:11,264","Okay well right now, we don't need more engineers."
tt0816692,"00:11:11,298","00:11:16,341",We didn't run out of television screens or planes; we ran out of food!
tt0816692,"00:11:16,453","00:11:20,813","The world needs farmers. Good farmers like you, and Tom."
tt0816692,"00:11:21,004","00:11:25,652",Uneducated farmers. -We are a caretaker generation Coop.
tt0816692,"00:11:25,771","00:11:29,473",And things are getting better. Maybe your grandkids will get to be...
tt0816692,"00:11:29,474","00:11:30,196",#NAME?
tt0816692,"00:11:31,465","00:11:35,678",No. Miss Hanley is here to talk about Murph.
tt0816692,"00:11:35,754","00:11:40,655","Murph is a great kid, she's really bright. But she's been having a little trouble lately."
tt0816692,"00:11:40,728","00:11:45,100",She brought this in to show the other students. The section on the lunar landings.
tt0816692,"00:11:45,176","00:11:49,631","Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks. She always loved the pictures."
tt0816692,"00:11:49,715","00:11:53,633",It's an old federal textbook. We've replaced them with the corrected versions.
tt0816692,"00:11:53,710","00:11:58,477",Corrected? -Explaining how the Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt...
tt0816692,"00:11:58,512","00:11:59,669",...the Soviet Union.
tt0816692,"00:12:05,030","00:12:08,187",You don't believe we went to the Moon?
tt0816692,"00:12:08,298","00:12:12,693",I believe it was a brilliant piece of propaganda that the Soviets bankrupted themselves...
tt0816692,"00:12:12,728","00:12:16,328",...pouring resources into rockets and other useless machines.
tt0816692,"00:12:16,436","00:12:17,876",Useless machines?
tt0816692,"00:12:17,985","00:12:21,864",And if we don't want a repeat of the excess and wastefulness of the 20th century...
tt0816692,"00:12:21,899","00:12:25,721",...then we need to teach our kids about this planet. Not tales of leaving it.
tt0816692,"00:12:25,830","00:12:30,421",Y'know one of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI.
tt0816692,"00:12:30,531","00:12:34,033","And if we had any of those left, the doctors would've been able to find..."
tt0816692,"00:12:34,108","00:12:38,064",...the cyst in my wife's brain before she died; instead of afterwards.
tt0816692,"00:12:38,136","00:12:41,837",And then she would have been the one sitting here listening to this instead of me...
tt0816692,"00:12:41,917","00:12:46,604",...which would've been a good thing because she was always the... the calmer one.
tt0816692,"00:12:46,868","00:12:49,851",I'm sorry about your wife Mr. Cooper.
tt0816692,"00:12:50,039","00:12:54,404",But Murph got into a fistfight with several of her classmates...
tt0816692,"00:12:54,405","00:12:56,809",...over this Apollo nonsense.
tt0816692,"00:12:56,844","00:12:59,955",So we thought it would be best to bring you in and see what ideas you might have...
tt0816692,"00:12:59,990","00:13:02,765",...for dealing with her behaviour on the home front.
tt0816692,"00:13:02,872","00:13:06,536","Yeah, you know what, there's a game tomorrow night."
tt0816692,"00:13:06,691","00:13:10,419","She's going through a bit of a baseball phase, her favorite team is playing."
tt0816692,"00:13:10,532","00:13:12,089",There's gonna be candy and soda...
tt0816692,"00:13:14,995","00:13:17,976",...I think I'll take her to that.
tt0816692,"00:13:22,182","00:13:26,980",How'd it go? -I got you suspended.
tt0816692,"00:13:27,090","00:13:29,247",What?? -Cooper.
tt0816692,"00:13:30,323","00:13:34,925","This is Cooper, go. -Coop, those combines you rebuilt went haywire."
tt0816692,"00:13:35,004","00:13:39,651","Just reset the controllers. -I did that, but you should come take a look."
tt0816692,"00:13:59,978","00:14:02,758",One by one they just teared off the fields and headed over.
tt0816692,"00:14:02,870","00:14:05,573",something's interfering with the compass.
tt0816692,"00:14:05,687","00:14:09,134",Magnetism. Or somethin' such.
tt0816692,"00:14:51,789","00:14:56,003","There's nothing special about which book. I've been working on it, like you said."
tt0816692,"00:14:56,073","00:14:59,344",I counted the spaces. -Why?
tt0816692,"00:15:00,897","00:15:05,834",In case the ghost is trying to communicate. I'm trying Morse.
tt0816692,"00:15:05,911","00:15:10,624","Morse? -Yeah, dots and dashes. It's..."
tt0816692,"00:15:10,696","00:15:13,020",I know what Morse code is Murph. But I still don't think your...
tt0816692,"00:15:13,034","00:15:15,222",...bookshelf is trying to talk to you.
tt0816692,"00:15:26,678","00:15:31,104",Had to reset every compass clock and GPS to offset off the anomaly.
tt0816692,"00:15:31,257","00:15:34,015",Which is? -I don't know.
tt0816692,"00:15:35,632","00:15:37,850",Now if the house had been built on magnetic ore...
tt0816692,"00:15:37,923","00:15:40,730",...we would have seen this the first time we switched on the tractor.
tt0816692,"00:15:42,866","00:15:46,694",I hear your meeting at the school didn't go so well.
tt0816692,"00:15:48,211","00:15:53,182","You heard? It's like we've forgotten who we are, Donald."
tt0816692,"00:15:55,055","00:15:58,145","Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers."
tt0816692,"00:16:00,745","00:16:04,882","When I was a kid, it felt like they made something new everyday."
tt0816692,"00:16:04,994","00:16:08,121",Some gadget or idea.
tt0816692,"00:16:08,231","00:16:12,875","Like every day was Christmas. But 6, billion people,"
tt0816692,"00:16:12,946","00:16:14,864",Just try to imagine that.
tt0816692,"00:16:15,432","00:16:19,219",And every last one of them trying to have it all.
tt0816692,"00:16:21,810","00:16:24,178",This world isn't so bad.
tt0816692,"00:16:27,246","00:16:30,548",And Tom will do just fine. You're the one who doesn't belong.
tt0816692,"00:16:30,623","00:16:33,318",Born 40 years too late or 40 years too early.
tt0816692,"00:16:34,254","00:16:36,779",My daughter knew it. God bless her.
tt0816692,"00:16:38,112","00:16:40,664","And your kids know it, especially Murph."
tt0816692,"00:16:40,773","00:16:44,086",Ahh we used to look up to the sky and wonder...
tt0816692,"00:16:44,895","00:16:47,483",...at our place in the stars.
tt0816692,"00:16:49,831","00:16:51,774","Now we just look down,"
tt0816692,"00:16:51,883","00:16:54,847",and worry about our place in the dirt.
tt0816692,"00:16:54,955","00:16:57,397","Cooper, you were good at something,"
tt0816692,"00:16:57,475","00:17:01,071",and you never got a chance to do anything with it.
tt0816692,"00:17:01,180","00:17:02,906",I'm sorry.
tt0816692,"00:17:04,351","00:17:08,320",You didn't expect this dirt that was giving you this food...
tt0816692,"00:17:08,402","00:17:12,222",...to turn on you like that and destroy you.
tt0816692,"00:17:12,302","00:17:17,212","In April I believe if I'm right, 15th of April I, I think."
tt0816692,"00:17:17,247","00:17:21,671",This just happened at about 1:30 when that thing came off the top of the canyon.
tt0816692,"00:17:21,746","00:17:27,025",In my day we had real ball players. Who're these bums?
tt0816692,"00:17:27,135","00:17:29,835","Well in my day, people were too busy..."
tt0816692,"00:17:29,921","00:17:32,247",...fighting over food to even play baseball.
tt0816692,"00:17:32,282","00:17:37,149",Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural. I want a hot dog.
tt0816692,"00:17:37,224","00:17:39,567",School says you're gonna follow in my footsteps.
tt0816692,"00:17:40,615","00:17:43,679",I think that's great. You think that's great?
tt0816692,"00:17:43,792","00:17:47,570",You hate farming dad. Grandpa said.
tt0816692,"00:17:47,678","00:17:52,320","Grandpa said huh? Listen, all that matters is how you feel about it."
tt0816692,"00:17:52,465","00:17:56,573",I like what you do. I like our farm.
tt0816692,"00:17:56,723","00:17:58,706",And you're gonna be great at it.
tt0816692,"00:18:11,585","00:18:13,134",Let's get outta here.
tt0816692,"00:18:20,961","00:18:25,138","All right it's a doozy. Alright gang, lets mask up."
tt0816692,"00:18:28,489","00:18:30,255","Tom, Murph? -Check. -Check?"
tt0816692,"00:19:23,986","00:19:26,198","Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?"
tt0816692,"00:19:30,208","00:19:31,543",Murph.
tt0816692,"00:19:52,269","00:19:57,117",The ghost. -Grab your pillow.
tt0816692,"00:19:57,226","00:19:59,570",You're sleeping with Tom.
tt0816692,"00:20:54,218","00:20:56,336",It's not a ghost.
tt0816692,"00:21:01,656","00:21:02,990",It's gravity.
tt0816692,"00:21:04,907","00:21:07,483","I'm dropping Tom, then heading into town."
tt0816692,"00:21:07,596","00:21:11,917",You wanna clean that up? When you've finished praying to it.
tt0816692,"00:21:37,327","00:21:39,917","It's not Morse Murph, it's binary."
tt0816692,"00:21:40,029","00:21:42,441","Thick is 1, thin is 0."
tt0816692,"00:21:46,185","00:21:47,734",Coordinates.
tt0816692,"00:22:01,028","00:22:05,911",That's it. -I can't miss this.
tt0816692,"00:22:06,025","00:22:08,572",Grandpa will be back in a couple of hours Murph.
tt0816692,"00:22:09,664","00:22:11,627",But you don't know what you're gonna find.
tt0816692,"00:22:12,542","00:22:17,542","And that, is why I can't take you."
tt0816692,"00:22:23,382","00:22:24,671",Murph?
tt0816692,"00:22:25,798","00:22:30,081","Grandpa will be home in a while, tell him I'll call him on the radio."
tt0816692,"00:22:37,236","00:22:40,195",Jesus! What're you doing?
tt0816692,"00:22:40,305","00:22:42,909",Oh d'you think it's funny? Huh?
tt0816692,"00:22:42,983","00:22:45,814",You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.
tt0816692,"00:22:47,794","00:22:50,231",Make yourself useful.
tt0816692,"00:23:53,203","00:23:54,253",Hey Murph.
tt0816692,"00:23:55,300","00:23:56,952",Murph.
tt0816692,"00:24:00,628","00:24:02,857",I think this is the end of the road.
tt0816692,"00:24:05,264","00:24:07,357",Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?
tt0816692,"00:24:09,234","00:24:10,604",That's my girl.
tt0816692,"00:24:37,200","00:24:41,617","Step away from the fence. -Don't shoot, don't shoot. I'm unarmed."
tt0816692,"00:24:41,724","00:24:42,981",My daughter is in the car.
tt0816692,"00:24:47,631","00:24:50,223",Don't be afraid.
tt0816692,"00:25:02,938","00:25:07,150",How did you find this place? -Where is my daughter?
tt0816692,"00:25:07,264","00:25:11,518",You had the coordinates for this facility marked on your map. Where did you get those coordinates?
tt0816692,"00:25:11,876","00:25:15,378","Where is my daughter?! -Don't make me take you down again, sit down!"
tt0816692,"00:25:15,486","00:25:18,434",Oh d'you still think you're a Marine pal?
tt0816692,"00:25:18,545","00:25:20,848",Marines don't exist. And you know what?
tt0816692,"00:25:20,956","00:25:24,662",I've got grunts like you mowing my grass.
tt0816692,"00:25:24,736","00:25:28,848",Where did you find those coordinates? -Unless you wanna end up as my second lawnmower...
tt0816692,"00:25:29,498","00:25:33,721","...no, I think I'll turn you into a valve of a vacuum or a dry cleaner. No you won't."
tt0816692,"00:25:35,101","00:25:37,686","TARS, back down please."
tt0816692,"00:25:38,947","00:25:42,018",You're taking a risk using ex-military security.
tt0816692,"00:25:42,136","00:25:46,202",They are old and their control units are unpredictable.
tt0816692,"00:25:46,315","00:25:48,219",It's what the government could spare.
tt0816692,"00:25:49,776","00:25:52,815",Who are you? -Dr. Brand.
tt0816692,"00:25:52,926","00:25:57,785","Yeah I knew a Dr. Brand once, he was a Professor. -What makes you think I'm not?"
tt0816692,"00:25:57,894","00:25:59,494",Wasn't near as cute either.
tt0816692,"00:25:59,609","00:26:03,350","Please Dr. Brand, I don't have any idea what this is."
tt0816692,"00:26:03,463","00:26:06,629","But I'm scared for my daughter, and I want her by my side."
tt0816692,"00:26:06,705","00:26:09,228","You give me that, and I'll tell you anything you want to know."
tt0816692,"00:26:12,260","00:26:14,797",Take the principal and the girl to the conference room.
tt0816692,"00:26:15,989","00:26:19,849",Your daughter is fine. Bright kid.
tt0816692,"00:26:19,927","00:26:24,461",Must have a very smart mother. -It's pretty clear you don't want any visitors.
tt0816692,"00:26:24,573","00:26:28,878","Why don't you let us back up from your fence and we'll be on our way, huh?"
tt0816692,"00:26:29,021","00:26:31,801","It's not that simple. -Well, sure it is."
tt0816692,"00:26:31,913","00:26:34,899",Look I don't know anything about you. I don't know anything about this place.
tt0816692,"00:26:35,008","00:26:37,239",Yes you do.
tt0816692,"00:26:42,097","00:26:44,003",Dad!
tt0816692,"00:26:46,934","00:26:48,230",Hello Cooper.
tt0816692,"00:26:49,492","00:26:50,718",Professor Brand.
tt0816692,"00:26:52,056","00:26:54,684",Explain to me how you found this facility.
tt0816692,"00:26:54,762","00:26:58,220",Kind of accidently stumbled upon it. We were on a salvage run...
tt0816692,"00:26:58,331","00:27:00,851",You're sitting in the best kept secret in the world.
tt0816692,"00:27:00,922","00:27:03,757","Nobody stumbles in here, nobody stumbles out."
tt0816692,"00:27:04,639","00:27:08,698","Cooper, please, cooperate with these people."
tt0816692,"00:27:08,843","00:27:13,013","Well, it's kinda hard to explain."
tt0816692,"00:27:13,087","00:27:17,122","We we.., we learnt these coordinates..."
tt0816692,"00:27:17,123","00:27:19,763",...from an anomaly. -What sort of anomaly?
tt0816692,"00:27:19,874","00:27:23,699",I hesitate to term it supernatural but it damn well wasn't scientific...
tt0816692,"00:27:23,812","00:27:28,650","You're gonna have to be specific Mr. Cooper, right now. -It was gravity."
tt0816692,"00:27:33,605","00:27:36,412",Um what sort of gravitational an- where was this thing?
tt0816692,"00:27:36,492","00:27:39,908","Hey, I'm real happy that you're excited about gravity bud, but..."
tt0816692,"00:27:39,909","00:27:44,478",...you're not getting any answers from us until I get assurances. -Assurances? -Yeah.
tt0816692,"00:27:45,530","00:27:49,510","Like that we're getting out of here, and I don't mean in the trunk of some car."
tt0816692,"00:27:50,867","00:27:55,349","Don't you know who we are Coop? -No Professor, I don't."
tt0816692,"00:27:55,457","00:27:59,059",You know my father Professor Brand. We're NASA.
tt0816692,"00:28:00,584","00:28:03,079",NASA. -NASA.
tt0816692,"00:28:03,222","00:28:05,744","The same NASA, you flew for."
tt0816692,"00:28:15,134","00:28:19,530","I heard they shut you down sir, for refusing to drop bombs from..."
tt0816692,"00:28:19,611","00:28:22,048",...the stratosphere on the starving people.
tt0816692,"00:28:22,266","00:28:24,764",When they realized that killing other people...
tt0816692,"00:28:24,765","00:28:29,299","...was not a long term solution, then they needed us back. In secret."
tt0816692,"00:28:29,411","00:28:33,930",Why secret? -Because public opinion wouldn't allow spending on space exploration.
tt0816692,"00:28:34,007","00:28:36,765",Not when you're struggling to put food on the table.
tt0816692,"00:28:36,874","00:28:42,159","Blight. Wheat, seven years ago."
tt0816692,"00:28:42,272","00:28:45,434","Okra, this year. -Now, there's just corn."
tt0816692,"00:28:45,547","00:28:48,145",And we're growing more than we ever had.
tt0816692,"00:28:48,256","00:28:52,605","Yeah, but like the potatoes in Ireland and the wheat in the dust bowl..."
tt0816692,"00:28:52,714","00:28:57,397",...the corn will die. Soon.
tt0816692,"00:29:02,475","00:29:06,262","We'll find a way, Professor, we always have."
tt0816692,"00:29:06,376","00:29:11,164",Driven by the unshakeable faith that the Earth is ours?
tt0816692,"00:29:11,279","00:29:13,296","Well not just ours, no."
tt0816692,"00:29:14,564","00:29:15,824",But it is our home.
tt0816692,"00:29:15,935","00:29:20,475",Earth's atmosphere is 80% nitrogen.
tt0816692,"00:29:20,584","00:29:22,515",We don't even breathe nitrogen.
tt0816692,"00:29:22,660","00:29:27,241","Blight does, and as it thrives, our air gets less and less oxygen."
tt0816692,"00:29:27,349","00:29:31,178","The last people to starve, will be the first to suffocate."
tt0816692,"00:29:31,293","00:29:33,577",And your daughter's generation...
tt0816692,"00:29:34,476","00:29:37,347",...will be the last to survive on Earth.
tt0816692,"00:29:37,459","00:29:41,421","Murph is feeling a little tired, and was wondering if she could take a nap in my office?"
tt0816692,"00:29:41,531","00:29:42,952","Yeah, thank you."
tt0816692,"00:29:45,885","00:29:47,003",Okay.
tt0816692,"00:29:47,147","00:29:51,211","Now you need to tell me, what your plan is to save the world?"
tt0816692,"00:29:52,548","00:29:56,169",We're not meant to save the world. We're meant to leave it.
tt0816692,"00:30:01,613","00:30:06,194",Rangers. -The last components of our one versatile ship in orbit.
tt0816692,"00:30:06,274","00:30:10,105",The Endurance. Our final expedition.
tt0816692,"00:30:10,214","00:30:14,183",You sent people out there looking for a new home?
tt0816692,"00:30:14,291","00:30:17,185",The Lazarus missions. -Sounds cheerful!
tt0816692,"00:30:17,292","00:30:21,552","Lazarus came back from the dead. -Sure, but he had to die in the first place."
tt0816692,"00:30:21,662","00:30:24,087",There's not a planet in our solar system that could sustain...
tt0816692,"00:30:24,088","00:30:27,569",...life and the nearest star is over a 1000 years away.
tt0816692,"00:30:27,604","00:30:29,703","I mean, it doesn't even qualify as futile."
tt0816692,"00:30:31,010","00:30:33,135",Where did you send them?
tt0816692,"00:30:33,206","00:30:39,004","Cooper, I can't tell you any more unless you agree to pilot this craft."
tt0816692,"00:30:39,120","00:30:43,514",You're the best pilot we ever had. -I barely left the stratosphere.
tt0816692,"00:30:43,622","00:30:45,925",This team never left the simulator!
tt0816692,"00:30:45,998","00:30:49,460","We need a pilot, and this is the mission that you were trained for."
tt0816692,"00:30:49,566","00:30:51,544","What, without even knowing?"
tt0816692,"00:30:51,690","00:30:56,649","An hour ago, you didn't even know I was alive, and you were going anyway."
tt0816692,"00:30:56,831","00:31:00,785",We had no choice. But something sent you here.
tt0816692,"00:31:00,930","00:31:03,393",They chose you. -Who's 'They'?
tt0816692,"00:31:11,142","00:31:15,213","How long, would I be gone? -Hard to know."
tt0816692,"00:31:15,325","00:31:19,232",Years. -I've got kids Professor.
tt0816692,"00:31:19,343","00:31:22,505","Get out there, and save them."
tt0816692,"00:31:25,455","00:31:29,190","Who's 'They'? -We started detecting gravitational anomalies,"
tt0816692,"00:31:29,309","00:31:31,044",almost 50 years ago.
tt0816692,"00:31:31,079","00:31:34,727",Mostly small distortions to our instruments in the upper atmosphere.
tt0816692,"00:31:34,840","00:31:38,004",In fact I believe you encountered one yourself.
tt0816692,"00:31:38,116","00:31:40,411","Yeah, in the Straits."
tt0816692,"00:31:40,524","00:31:44,694","My crash, something tripped my fly-by-wire."
tt0816692,"00:31:44,770","00:31:51,628","Exactly. But of all these anomalies, the most significant is this."
tt0816692,"00:31:51,774","00:31:55,692",Out near Saturn. A disturbance of spacetime.
tt0816692,"00:31:57,252","00:32:01,389",Is that a wormhole? -It appeared 48 years ago.
tt0816692,"00:32:01,539","00:32:05,597","And it leads, where? -Another galaxy."
tt0816692,"00:32:06,967","00:32:10,060",A wormhole is not a naturally occuring phenomenon.
tt0816692,"00:32:10,167","00:32:12,702",Someone placed it there. -'They'?
tt0816692,"00:32:13,962","00:32:17,934","And whoever they are, they appear to be looking out for us."
tt0816692,"00:32:18,043","00:32:21,179",That wormhole let's us travel to other stars.
tt0816692,"00:32:21,298","00:32:23,452",It came right around when we needed it.
tt0816692,"00:32:23,547","00:32:26,688",They've put potentially habitable worlds right within our reach.
tt0816692,"00:32:26,832","00:32:30,701","Twelve, in fact from our initial probes. -You sent probes into that?"
tt0816692,"00:32:30,847","00:32:34,381","We sent people into it, 10 years ago."
tt0816692,"00:32:34,494","00:32:37,044",The Lazarus missions.
tt0816692,"00:32:37,550","00:32:40,784","12 possible worlds, 12 Ranger launches."
tt0816692,"00:32:40,785","00:32:44,129",Carrying the bravest humans ever to live.
tt0816692,"00:32:44,307","00:32:47,084",Led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.
tt0816692,"00:32:47,360","00:32:50,361",Each person's landing pod had enough life support for two years.
tt0816692,"00:32:50,428","00:32:52,015",But they could use hibernation to stretch that...
tt0816692,"00:32:52,124","00:32:56,120",...making observations on organics over a decade or more.
tt0816692,"00:32:56,270","00:32:58,529",Their mission was to assess their world and...
tt0816692,"00:32:58,606","00:33:02,310","...if it showed potential, then they could send out a signal and bed down for the long nap..."
tt0816692,"00:33:02,419","00:33:06,743",...wait to be rescued. -And what if the world didn't show promise?
tt0816692,"00:33:07,135","00:33:08,789",Hence the bravery.
tt0816692,"00:33:08,898","00:33:13,120",You don't have the resources to visit all 12. -No.
tt0816692,"00:33:14,699","00:33:17,039",Data transmission back through the wormhole is rudimentary.
tt0816692,"00:33:17,148","00:33:20,030",Simple binary pings on an annual basis...
tt0816692,"00:33:20,126","00:33:24,823",...give us some clue as to which worlds have potential. One system shows promise.
tt0816692,"00:33:24,895","00:33:27,192","Well one, that's a bit of a long shot isn't it?"
tt0816692,"00:33:27,621","00:33:30,796",One system with 3 potential worlds?
tt0816692,"00:33:30,908","00:33:32,695",Not a long shot.
tt0816692,"00:33:35,109","00:33:38,924",Wait. So if we find a home...
tt0816692,"00:33:42,606","00:33:45,889",...then what? -That's the long shot.
tt0816692,"00:33:46,047","00:33:49,246","There is a plan A, and a plan B."
tt0816692,"00:33:49,358","00:33:53,278",Did you notice anything strange about the launch chamber?
tt0816692,"00:34:03,690","00:34:07,465",This entire facility is a centrifuge.
tt0816692,"00:34:07,612","00:34:12,591",Some kind of vehicle? A space station? -Both. The plan A.
tt0816692,"00:34:12,706","00:34:14,214",How do you get it off the ground?
tt0816692,"00:34:14,397","00:34:18,637",The first gravitational anomalies changed everything.
tt0816692,"00:34:18,784","00:34:23,173",Suddenly we knew that harnessing gravity was real.
tt0816692,"00:34:23,319","00:34:27,196",So I started working on a theory and we started...
tt0816692,"00:34:27,267","00:34:30,510",...building this station. -But you haven't solved it yet.
tt0816692,"00:34:30,656","00:34:33,350",That's why there's a plan B.
tt0816692,"00:34:33,534","00:34:35,700",The problem is gravity.
tt0816692,"00:34:35,847","00:34:38,689",How to get a viable amount of human life off the planet?
tt0816692,"00:34:38,876","00:34:42,871",This is one way. The plan B. Population bomb.
tt0816692,"00:34:42,982","00:34:47,217",Over 5000 fertilized eggs weighing in at just under 900 kilos.
tt0816692,"00:34:48,701","00:34:52,834",How would you raise 'em? -With the equipment onboard we incubate the first ten.
tt0816692,"00:34:52,995","00:34:56,615","After that, with surrogacy the growth becomes exponential."
tt0816692,"00:34:56,761","00:35:00,789","In 30 years, we could have a colony of hundreds."
tt0816692,"00:35:00,902","00:35:04,983",The real difficulty with colonization is genetic diversity.
tt0816692,"00:35:05,018","00:35:06,154",This will take care of that.
tt0816692,"00:35:06,335","00:35:11,047","Yeah, but what about the people here? You just, you'd give up on 'em?"
tt0816692,"00:35:11,191","00:35:16,165",My kids? -That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.
tt0816692,"00:35:18,191","00:35:21,747",How far have you got? -Almost there.
tt0816692,"00:35:21,890","00:35:24,768",You're asking me to hang everything...
tt0816692,"00:35:24,920","00:35:29,387",...on an 'almost'. -I'm asking you to trust me.
tt0816692,"00:35:31,978","00:35:34,497",Find us a new home.
tt0816692,"00:35:34,645","00:35:39,096","And by the time you return, I would've solved the problem..."
tt0816692,"00:35:39,422","00:35:42,650",...of gravity. I give you my word.
tt0816692,"00:35:55,320","00:35:56,621",Go away!
tt0816692,"00:36:07,494","00:36:11,697",Murph. -Go. If you're leaving just go!
tt0816692,"00:36:14,188","00:36:18,352","This world was never enough for you, was it Cooper?"
tt0816692,"00:36:18,437","00:36:22,892","What, cause heading out there is what I feel like... ...I was born to do?"
tt0816692,"00:36:22,980","00:36:24,883",And it excites me?
tt0816692,"00:36:25,031","00:36:29,352","Nah, it does not make it wrong. -It might."
tt0816692,"00:36:29,502","00:36:33,295",Don't trust the right thing done for the wrong reason.
tt0816692,"00:36:33,744","00:36:38,324","The 'why' of the thing, that's the foundation. -And the foundation's solid."
tt0816692,"00:36:40,659","00:36:44,208","We farmers, we sit here every year when..."
tt0816692,"00:36:44,243","00:36:48,171","...the rains fail, and we say: Next year."
tt0816692,"00:36:48,318","00:36:52,380","Well, next year ain't gonna save us, nor the one after that."
tt0816692,"00:36:52,490","00:36:57,198","This world's a treasure Donald, but it's been telling us to leave for a while now."
tt0816692,"00:37:01,591","00:37:05,721","Mankind was born on Earth, it was never meant to die here."
tt0816692,"00:37:08,866","00:37:13,387","Tom will be alright, but you got to make things right with Murph. -I will."
tt0816692,"00:37:13,702","00:37:17,442",Without making promises you don't know you can keep.
tt0816692,"00:37:26,975","00:37:29,889",You have to talk to me Murph.
tt0816692,"00:37:31,397","00:37:34,779",I need to fix this before I go.
tt0816692,"00:37:34,936","00:37:37,408",Then I'll keep it broken so you'll have to stay.
tt0816692,"00:37:38,641","00:37:44,513","After you kids came along, your mom, she said something to me I never quite understood."
tt0816692,"00:37:44,662","00:37:49,407","She said: Now, we're just here..."
tt0816692,"00:37:50,232","00:37:52,572",...to be the memories for our kids.
tt0816692,"00:37:57,214","00:38:00,170",I think I now understand what she meant.
tt0816692,"00:38:02,980","00:38:07,794","Once you're a parent, you're the ghost of your children's future."
tt0816692,"00:38:08,886","00:38:11,700",You said ghosts didn't exist.
tt0816692,"00:38:17,743","00:38:19,469",That's right Murph.
tt0816692,"00:38:22,025","00:38:24,469",Look at me.
tt0816692,"00:38:26,947","00:38:29,486",I can't be your ghost right now.
tt0816692,"00:38:31,213","00:38:33,223",I need to exist.
tt0816692,"00:38:34,485","00:38:37,249",They chose me.
tt0816692,"00:38:37,440","00:38:41,282","Murph, they chose me. You saw it. You're the one who led me to 'em."
tt0816692,"00:38:43,400","00:38:46,779",And that's exactly why you can't go!
tt0816692,"00:38:49,842","00:38:54,819",I figured out the message. One word. You know what it is?
tt0816692,"00:38:54,929","00:38:57,530",Murph. -STAY.
tt0816692,"00:38:57,680","00:39:00,954",It says STAY dad. -Murph.
tt0816692,"00:39:01,067","00:39:05,868",You don't believe me! Look at the books. Look it says STAY.
tt0816692,"00:39:05,986","00:39:10,380",Why are you not listening? IT SAYS STAY! -I'm coming back.
tt0816692,"00:39:10,489","00:39:12,610",When??
tt0816692,"00:39:24,692","00:39:28,480",One for you. One for me.
tt0816692,"00:39:28,586","00:39:30,493","When I'm up there in hypersleep,"
tt0816692,"00:39:30,687","00:39:34,216","or, or traveling at the speed of light,"
tt0816692,"00:39:34,403","00:39:36,856","or, near a black hole,"
tt0816692,"00:39:37,000","00:39:40,306",Time is gonna change for me.
tt0816692,"00:39:40,451","00:39:42,620",And it's gonna run more slowly.
tt0816692,"00:39:42,757","00:39:45,742","So, when we get back,"
tt0816692,"00:39:45,927","00:39:50,575",we're gonna compare. -Time will run differently for us?
tt0816692,"00:39:50,688","00:39:51,518",Yeah.
tt0816692,"00:39:51,631","00:39:55,769","Maybe by the time I get back, you and I, we might be the same age."
tt0816692,"00:39:55,918","00:39:58,436",You and me. What??
tt0816692,"00:39:58,585","00:40:00,024",Imagine that!
tt0816692,"00:40:03,661","00:40:07,731","Ah, Murph. -You've no idea when you're coming back!!"
tt0816692,"00:40:09,217","00:40:13,003",No idea at all! -Murph.
tt0816692,"00:40:14,297","00:40:18,324","Murph, don't ma-, don't make me leave like this. Murph!"
tt0816692,"00:40:18,506","00:40:21,100",Don't make me leave like this Murph!!
tt0816692,"00:40:27,180","00:40:31,882","Hey,...I love you."
tt0816692,"00:40:32,065","00:40:35,895",You hear me? I love you forever.
tt0816692,"00:40:36,040","00:40:37,407",And I'm coming back.
tt0816692,"00:40:43,423","00:40:44,905",I'm coming back.
tt0816692,"00:41:02,627","00:41:05,370",How did it go? -Fine.
tt0816692,"00:41:05,485","00:41:06,921",Just fine.
tt0816692,"00:41:14,839","00:41:19,779","I love you Tom. -Travel safe, okay? -Yeah. Take care of our place for me alright?"
tt0816692,"00:41:19,892","00:41:23,146",Huh? -Uh huh.
tt0816692,"00:41:26,138","00:41:29,527","Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone? -You mean your truck?"
tt0816692,"00:41:31,113","00:41:33,090",I'll make sure they bring it back.
tt0816692,"00:41:34,320","00:41:36,661",Look after my kids Donald.
tt0816692,"00:41:49,617","00:41:53,282",Go for main engines. Start T minus 10.
tt0816692,"00:41:53,744","00:41:57,993",Dad! -9 -Dad!!
tt0816692,"00:41:58,028","00:42:02,467","8, 7. -DAD!!!"
tt0816692,"00:42:03,265","00:42:07,815","6, 5. Main engines start."
tt0816692,"00:42:07,928","00:42:16,781","4, 3, 2, 1. Booster ignition, and."
tt0816692,"00:42:24,885","00:42:27,511",All engines look good. Beginning roll program.
tt0816692,"00:42:30,247","00:42:35,064",Prepare for stage one separation.
tt0816692,"00:42:35,217","00:42:37,006",Stage one.
tt0816692,"00:42:42,805","00:42:48,199",Everybody good? Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?
tt0816692,"00:42:49,670","00:42:53,768","They gave him a humor setting, to fit in better with his unit."
tt0816692,"00:42:53,769","00:42:58,460",He thinks it relaxes us. -A giant sarcastic robot!
tt0816692,"00:42:59,798","00:43:03,791","What a great idea! -I have a cue light I could use when I'm joking, if you'd like?"
tt0816692,"00:43:03,826","00:43:05,025","That wouldn't be a problem, no."
tt0816692,"00:43:05,135","00:43:09,230",Yeah you could use it to find your way back into the ship after I blow you out the air lock.
tt0816692,"00:43:09,381","00:43:12,270",What's your humor setting TARS?
tt0816692,"00:43:12,350","00:43:15,276",100% -Let's bring it down to 75 please.
tt0816692,"00:43:15,565","00:43:18,229",Stage two separation.
tt0816692,"00:43:27,490","00:43:31,519",All feeds going manual. -Going manual.
tt0816692,"00:43:33,789","00:43:37,644","Deactivate probe heater 1, 2 and 3. -Check."
tt0816692,"00:43:41,204","00:43:46,100",Taking control. -This is handover to you.
tt0816692,"00:43:49,205","00:43:51,683",ABF check. Over.
tt0816692,"00:43:51,834","00:43:56,378","Retro thrusters fuel cells 1, 2, 3."
tt0816692,"00:43:56,413","00:44:00,049",100% ex-mites.
tt0816692,"00:44:07,320","00:44:11,837",It's hard leaving everything. My kids.
tt0816692,"00:44:11,985","00:44:15,921","Your father. -We're gonna be spending a lot of time together,"
tt0816692,"00:44:16,043","00:44:19,601",#NAME?
tt0816692,"00:44:20,655","00:44:25,478",Just being honest. -Well you don't need to be that honest.
tt0816692,"00:44:25,585","00:44:30,010","Hey TARS, what's your honesty parameter? -90%"
tt0816692,"00:44:30,155","00:44:31,633",90%?
tt0816692,"00:44:31,745","00:44:35,273",Absolute honesty isn't always the most diplomatic...
tt0816692,"00:44:35,391","00:44:39,022",...nor the safest form of communication with emotional beings. -Okay!
tt0816692,"00:44:39,132","00:44:41,478",90% it is Dr. Brand.
tt0816692,"00:44:45,222","00:44:48,532",We're coming up on the Endurance. 12 minutes out.
tt0816692,"00:45:05,338","00:45:07,605",Okay taking control.
tt0816692,"00:45:10,888","00:45:13,836","Approaching module port, 500 meters."
tt0816692,"00:45:26,747","00:45:28,655",It's all you Doyle.
tt0816692,"00:45:46,023","00:45:49,691","Nice and easy Doyle, nice and easy."
tt0816692,"00:45:53,661","00:45:57,481",Take us home.
tt0816692,"00:46:03,900","00:46:06,815",Target locked.
tt0816692,"00:46:06,961","00:46:09,379","Target locked. -Well done. -Okay, helmets on."
tt0816692,"00:46:09,535","00:46:10,433",Good job.
tt0816692,"00:46:43,761","00:46:46,799",The door is not charging. Never mind!
tt0816692,"00:47:09,842","00:47:13,342","Cooper, you should have control. -Control here."
tt0816692,"00:47:14,429","00:47:17,062",Communication with ring module active.
tt0816692,"00:47:30,889","00:47:32,652",That's initiate.
tt0816692,"00:47:40,213","00:47:42,410",Are we ready to spin? -Just a sec.
tt0816692,"00:47:53,354","00:47:56,410",Hello CASE. -Hello TARS.
tt0816692,"00:47:57,132","00:48:00,804","Okay, we're all set. -All right let's do it."
tt0816692,"00:48:30,498","00:48:32,048",30% of spin.
tt0816692,"00:48:37,814","00:48:39,466",One g.
tt0816692,"00:48:40,626","00:48:44,227",How is gravity treating you back there?
tt0816692,"00:48:47,173","00:48:51,143","Romilly, hey you okay? -Yeah. -You all right?"
tt0816692,"00:48:51,254","00:48:52,126","Yeah, no I just need a minute."
tt0816692,"00:48:53,030","00:48:56,307","Okay, I think we have some dramamine in the hibe pad, I'm just gonna go get that."
tt0816692,"00:48:56,419","00:48:59,690",It'll be in the cryo beds Just be a sec. -Hey Brand?
tt0816692,"00:48:59,809","00:49:01,321",Yeah? -Bring a lot.
tt0816692,"00:49:09,771","00:49:13,439","Amelia, be safe."
tt0816692,"00:49:13,592","00:49:17,720",Give my regards to Dr. Mann. -I will Dad.
tt0816692,"00:49:17,831","00:49:22,791","It looks good for your trajectory. We've calculated, two years to Saturn."
tt0816692,"00:49:22,906","00:49:24,711",That's a lot of Dramamine.
tt0816692,"00:49:25,865","00:49:27,880","Look after my family will you please, sir?"
tt0816692,"00:49:28,023","00:49:31,260","We'll be waiting for you, when you get back."
tt0816692,"00:49:31,801","00:49:36,333","A little older, a little wiser, but happy to see you."
tt0816692,"00:49:38,316","00:49:41,771","'Do not go gentle into that good night,'"
tt0816692,"00:49:41,962","00:49:46,664","'old age should burn and rave at close of day,'"

tt0816692,"00:50:33,361","00:50:35,085","Here, pills."
tt0816692,"00:50:37,896","00:50:42,028",So alone. -We have each other. Dr. Mann had it worse.
tt0816692,"00:50:42,137","00:50:43,436",I mean them.
tt0816692,"00:50:46,130","00:50:49,050",It's a perfect planet and we're not gonna find another one like it.
tt0816692,"00:50:49,228","00:50:53,579","No, it's not like, looking for a new condo."
tt0816692,"00:50:53,729","00:50:57,803","The human race is going to be, adrift."
tt0816692,"00:50:57,949","00:51:01,876",Desperate for a rock it can cling to while it catches it's breath.
tt0816692,"00:51:01,911","00:51:03,569","We need to find that rock,"
tt0816692,"00:51:04,470","00:51:08,698",and our 3 prospects are at the edge of what might sustain human life.
tt0816692,"00:51:09,621","00:51:13,902",Laura Miller's planet is the first. Laura started our biology program.
tt0816692,"00:51:19,294","00:51:22,395",Wolf Edmunds is here. -Tell me about Edmunds.
tt0816692,"00:51:23,436","00:51:25,844","Oh, um, Wolf's a particle physicist."
tt0816692,"00:51:28,441","00:51:30,206",Any of them had any families?
tt0816692,"00:51:31,614","00:51:34,515","No, no attachments. My father insisted."
tt0816692,"00:51:34,704","00:51:37,327",They'all knew the possibility of...
tt0816692,"00:51:37,402","00:51:40,330",...seeing another human being again. I'm hoping we can surprise at least 3 of them.
tt0816692,"00:51:40,480","00:51:44,741","Dr. Mann? -Dr. Mann, well, he's remarkable.  He's the best of us."
tt0816692,"00:51:44,921","00:51:47,804",He inspired 11 people to follow him on the loneliest journey...
tt0816692,"00:51:47,889","00:51:49,836",...in human history.
tt0816692,"00:51:49,871","00:51:52,238","Scientists, explorers. That's what I love."
tt0816692,"00:51:52,382","00:51:55,404","Y'know out there, we would face great odds."
tt0816692,"00:51:55,560","00:51:59,745","Death. But, not evil."
tt0816692,"00:51:59,892","00:52:02,228",You don't think nature can be evil?
tt0816692,"00:52:02,373","00:52:07,193","No. Formidable, frightening. But, no, not evil."
tt0816692,"00:52:08,608","00:52:12,495",Is a lion evil because it rips a gazelle to shreds?
tt0816692,"00:52:12,647","00:52:14,481",Just what we take with us then?
tt0816692,"00:52:15,318","00:52:19,349",Yeah. This crew represents the best of humanity.
tt0816692,"00:52:19,495","00:52:22,532","Even me, huh? -Y'know what? We agreed, 90%."
tt0816692,"00:52:22,675","00:52:24,842",Don't stay up.
tt0816692,"00:52:24,949","00:52:26,114",I'll be in a minute.
tt0816692,"00:52:26,273","00:52:30,418","Just remember Coop, you're literally wasting your breath."
tt0816692,"00:52:36,833","00:52:39,962","Hey TARS, let's go over that trajectory one more time."
tt0816692,"00:52:40,970","00:52:44,886","8 months to Mars. Gravity powered slingshot around,"
tt0816692,"00:52:45,000","00:52:47,345",14 months to Saturn. Nothing has changed on that.
tt0816692,"00:52:47,493","00:52:48,970",Let me ask you something.
tt0816692,"00:52:51,454","00:52:54,692",Dr. Brand and Edmunds. -Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.
tt0816692,"00:52:56,568","00:53:01,540","Dr. Brand and Edmunds, they close? -I wouldn't know."
tt0816692,"00:53:01,728","00:53:04,613",Is that '90% wouldn't know' or '10% wouldn't know'?
tt0816692,"00:53:04,760","00:53:06,812",I also have a discretion setting Cooper.
tt0816692,"00:53:08,470","00:53:12,177",But not a poker-face slick.
tt0816692,"00:53:23,663","00:53:24,961",Hey guys.
tt0816692,"00:53:25,108","00:53:28,782",Dad's about to go down for the long nap.
tt0816692,"00:53:28,928","00:53:31,732","and I just, wanted to give you an update."
tt0816692,"00:53:31,885","00:53:35,745",The Earth looks amazing from here.
tt0816692,"00:53:35,896","00:53:40,035",You can't see any of the dust.
tt0816692,"00:53:41,012","00:53:44,432","I really hope you guys are doin', doin' great."
tt0816692,"00:53:44,579","00:53:47,325","I know you're gonna get this message,"
tt0816692,"00:53:47,435","00:53:51,855","Professor Brand assured me that he was gonna get it to you. Alright, okay I love you!"
tt0816692,"00:53:53,336","00:53:55,468",Is it him? -I don't think so Murph.
tt0816692,"00:54:02,058","00:54:04,432",You must be Donald.
tt0816692,"00:54:05,728","00:54:10,314",Hello Murph. -Why are you in my dad's truck?
tt0816692,"00:54:10,465","00:54:13,127",He wanted me to bring it for your brother.
tt0816692,"00:54:13,275","00:54:15,903",He sent you a message.
tt0816692,"00:54:19,335","00:54:21,275",She's pretty upset with him for leaving.
tt0816692,"00:54:21,421","00:54:24,802",If you record any messages I can get them transmitted to Cooper.
tt0816692,"00:54:26,244","00:54:33,303","Murph is a bright spark. Maybe, I should fan the flame."
tt0816692,"00:54:33,338","00:54:37,979","She's already making fools of her teachers, well, maybe she should come and make a fool out of you."
tt0816692,"00:54:39,275","00:54:42,513",So where are they? -Heading for Mars.
tt0816692,"00:54:42,625","00:54:47,014","The next time you hear from Cooper, they'll be coming up on Saturn."
tt0816692,"00:55:26,315","00:55:30,376",They want me to repeat plant pathology.
tt0816692,"00:55:30,523","00:55:35,958","It sucks. But, they said I could start advanced agriculture a year early."
tt0816692,"00:55:36,424","00:55:39,883","So...alright. Well, I gotta go Dad."
tt0816692,"00:55:40,070","00:55:41,145",Hope you're safe up there.
tt0816692,"00:55:44,333","00:55:49,005","Sorry Coop, I asked Murph to say hi."
tt0816692,"00:55:49,079","00:55:54,016",But she's as stubborn as her old man. I'll try again next time.
tt0816692,"00:56:09,278","00:56:10,682",Are you okay Rom?
tt0816692,"00:56:11,910","00:56:16,603","This gets to me Cooper. This, this."
tt0816692,"00:56:16,744","00:56:20,200",Millimeters of aluminum protecting us and then nothing...
tt0816692,"00:56:20,346","00:56:24,054","...out there for millions of miles, won't kill us in seconds."
tt0816692,"00:56:25,134","00:56:30,048",Did you know that some of the finest solo yatchsmen in the world...
tt0816692,"00:56:30,083","00:56:34,741","...don't know how to swim? They don't know, and if they go overboard, it's done."
tt0816692,"00:56:36,338","00:56:38,578",We are explorers Rom.
tt0816692,"00:56:39,918","00:56:43,132",This is our boat. Here.
tt0816692,"00:57:10,163","00:57:14,937","This is the, relay probe? -In orbit around the wormhole."
tt0816692,"00:57:15,051","00:57:17,566",This is the wormhole and every time we come around...
tt0816692,"00:57:17,711","00:57:21,416",...we would receive images from the other side of the foreign galaxy.
tt0816692,"00:57:21,527","00:57:25,015",Like swinging a periscope around. -Exactly.
tt0816692,"00:57:25,129","00:57:29,030","So we got a pretty good idea, what we're gonna find on the other side, huh?"
tt0816692,"00:57:30,329","00:57:31,982",Navigationally.
tt0816692,"00:57:33,104","00:57:36,705","Hey guys, looks like we're gonna be approaching the wormhole in about three hours."
tt0816692,"00:57:43,586","00:57:46,721","Hey Coop, can we stop the spinning?"
tt0816692,"00:57:46,835","00:57:50,790",Why? -Because we are close enough to see it.
tt0816692,"00:57:52,304","00:57:54,971",Aha.
tt0816692,"00:57:59,191","00:58:03,403","Look, that's, that's it! That's the wormhole!"
tt0816692,"00:58:03,546","00:58:06,473","Say it, don't spray it Rom. It's a sphere."
tt0816692,"00:58:06,619","00:58:10,176",Well of course it is! What you thought it would just be a hole?
tt0816692,"00:58:11,226","00:58:15,107",No. It's just that all the illustrations I've ever seen they...
tt0816692,"00:58:15,272","00:58:19,117","The illustrations, try to show how it works."
tt0816692,"00:58:19,235","00:58:23,439","So they say you want to go from here, to there."
tt0816692,"00:58:23,593","00:58:25,078",But this is too far.
tt0816692,"00:58:25,261","00:58:28,884",So a wormhole bends space like this so you...
tt0816692,"00:58:28,919","00:58:32,507",...can take a shortcut through a higher dimension.
tt0816692,"00:58:32,618","00:58:37,412","Okay so, to show that they've turned 3-dimensional space..."
tt0816692,"00:58:37,488","00:58:41,785","...into 2 dimensions, which turns a wormhole in 2 dimensions..."
tt0816692,"00:58:41,804","00:58:44,952",...a circle. What's a circle in 3 dimensions?
tt0816692,"00:58:46,147","00:58:49,314",A sphere. -Exactly. A spherical hole.
tt0816692,"00:58:49,859","00:58:53,439",But who put it there? Who do we have to thank?
tt0816692,"00:58:53,660","00:58:58,374",I'm not thanking anybody until we get outta here in one piece Rom.
tt0816692,"00:59:03,694","00:59:06,791",Any trick to this Doyle?
tt0816692,"00:59:08,168","00:59:09,530",No one knows.
tt0816692,"00:59:15,971","00:59:18,814","The others made it, right?"
tt0816692,"00:59:20,584","00:59:22,638",At least some of 'em.
tt0816692,"00:59:53,359","00:59:57,491",Everybody ready to say goodbye to our solar system?
tt0816692,"00:59:57,638","01:00:00,223",To our galaxy.
tt0816692,"01:00:01,779","01:00:03,478",Here we go.
tt0816692,"01:00:35,695","01:00:39,152",Controls won't work here. We are passing through the bulk.
tt0816692,"01:00:39,264","01:00:44,090",Its space beyond our 3 dimensions. All you can do is report and observe.
tt0816692,"01:00:54,008","01:00:56,532",What is that?
tt0816692,"01:00:57,806","01:01:02,597",I think it's 'Them'. -Distorting spacetime?
tt0816692,"01:01:03,975","01:01:06,279",Don't. Don't!
tt0816692,"01:01:33,900","01:01:34,869",What was that?
tt0816692,"01:01:37,255","01:01:39,378",First handshake.
tt0816692,"01:01:41,054","01:01:42,322",We're...
tt0816692,"01:01:43,405","01:01:44,737",We're here.
tt0816692,"01:02:05,707","01:02:08,910",So the lost communications came through. -How?
tt0816692,"01:02:09,023","01:02:13,985","The relay on this side cached them. It's years of basic data, no real surprises."
tt0816692,"01:02:14,966","01:02:19,480","Miller's site has kept pinging 'thumbs up', as has Dr. Mann's."
tt0816692,"01:02:19,515","01:02:23,319",Edmunds went down three years ago. -Transmitter failure?
tt0816692,"01:02:23,428","01:02:26,313",Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up right until it went dark.
tt0816692,"01:02:26,462","01:02:30,079","But Miller's still looks good though, right? Because she's coming up fast."
tt0816692,"01:02:30,191","01:02:32,428",But there's one complication.
tt0816692,"01:02:32,501","01:02:36,577",The planet is much closer to Gargantua than we thought.
tt0816692,"01:02:36,648","01:02:39,775",Gargantua? -It's what we're calling the black hole.
tt0816692,"01:02:39,925","01:02:41,967",Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets both orbit it.
tt0816692,"01:02:42,002","01:02:45,194",And Miller's is on the horizon? -Like a basketball around a hoop.
tt0816692,"01:02:45,308","01:02:47,915",Landing there takes us dangerously close...
tt0816692,"01:02:48,091","01:02:51,185",...and a black hole that big has a huge gravitational pull.
tt0816692,"01:02:53,298","01:02:56,820","Okay I-, I could swing around that neutron star..."
tt0816692,"01:02:56,934","01:02:59,485","-No no no, it's not that, it's time. The gravity on that planet will..."
tt0816692,"01:02:59,632","01:03:02,920","...slow our clock compared to Earth's,.. drastically."
tt0816692,"01:03:02,955","01:03:04,683",Well how bad?
tt0816692,"01:03:04,794","01:03:11,596","Well, every hour we spend on that planet will be, uhh, seven years back on Earth."
tt0816692,"01:03:12,927","01:03:15,804",Jesus. -That's relativity folks.
tt0816692,"01:03:16,930","01:03:20,204","Well, we can't just drop down there without... -Cooper..."
tt0816692,"01:03:20,352","01:03:22,790","We have a mission. -Yeah Doyle, we have a mission."
tt0816692,"01:03:22,896","01:03:25,437","And our mission, Plan A is to find a planet..."
tt0816692,"01:03:25,472","01:03:27,978",...that can habitate the people that are living on the Earth right now.
tt0816692,"01:03:28,087","01:03:30,714","You can't just think about your family, now you have to think bigger than that, alright?"
tt0816692,"01:03:30,864","01:03:33,809",I'm thinking about my family and millions of other families.
tt0816692,"01:03:33,891","01:03:38,816","Okay, Plan A does not work, if the people on Earth are dead by the time we pull it off."
tt0816692,"01:03:39,686","01:03:43,058","No, it doesn't. That's why there's a Plan B."
tt0816692,"01:03:44,754","01:03:49,225",Okay. Cooper's right. We have to think about time as a resource just like...
tt0816692,"01:03:49,335","01:03:51,676",...oxygen and food. Going down there is gonna cost us.
tt0816692,"01:03:51,858","01:03:58,048","Okay look, Dr. Mann's data is promising, alright,"
tt0816692,"01:03:58,192","01:04:01,670","but it's gonna take us months to get there, and Edmunds, it's even further."
tt0816692,"01:04:01,705","01:04:04,237",Now Miller hasn't said much. But what she has said is very promising.
tt0816692,"01:04:04,387","01:04:07,141","It's water, it's organics. -You don't find that everyday."
tt0816692,"01:04:07,219","01:04:10,662","No, you don't and just think about the resources including time..."
tt0816692,"01:04:10,780","01:04:13,038",...that would be spent trying to get back here.
tt0816692,"01:04:14,526","01:04:16,148",Romilly. -Yeah.
tt0816692,"01:04:16,183","01:04:20,594",How far off of Miller's planet do we have to be to stay out of the time shift?
tt0816692,"01:04:20,629","01:04:24,876","Alright, just back from the cusp. -Which is here, just outside of Miller's planet."
tt0816692,"01:04:24,992","01:04:27,428",Alright. Okay.
tt0816692,"01:04:27,547","01:04:30,811","Here's Gargantua, here's Miller's planet."
tt0816692,"01:04:30,959","01:04:34,597","Instead of taking the Endurance into orbit around Miller's planet, which would..."
tt0816692,"01:04:34,632","01:04:37,443","...conserve fuel, but we'd lose a lot of time,"
tt0816692,"01:04:37,478","01:04:42,016","what if, what if we take a wider orbit around Gargantua, parallel with Miller's planet,"
tt0816692,"01:04:42,125","01:04:45,546","outside of it's time shift, to here. Then we take the Ranger down,"
tt0816692,"01:04:45,581","01:04:48,565","we get Miller, we get her samples, we come back, we analyze, we debrief..."
tt0816692,"01:04:48,600","01:04:52,421","...we're in, we're out, we lose a little fuel. But we save a lot of time."
tt0816692,"01:04:52,538","01:04:54,442",That'll work. -That's good. -There's not gonna...
tt0816692,"01:04:54,593","01:04:58,340","be time for monkey business or chit-chat down there, so TARS, you should definitely stay here."
tt0816692,"01:04:59,498","01:05:02,135","CASE, you're with me. Anyone else can stay."
tt0816692,"01:05:02,282","01:05:04,591","If we are talking about a couple of years,"
tt0816692,"01:05:04,786","01:05:06,868","I could use the time to research gravity,"
tt0816692,"01:05:07,013","01:05:09,499","observations from the wormhole, that's gold to Professor Brand."
tt0816692,"01:05:09,609","01:05:13,903","TARS, factor an orbit around Gargantua, conserve fuel, minimize thrusting."
tt0816692,"01:05:14,018","01:05:16,427",Make sure we stay in range from Miller's planet. You got it?
tt0816692,"01:05:16,545","01:05:19,759","I wouldn't leave you behind, Dr. Brand."
tt0816692,"01:05:24,478","01:05:28,101",You ready CASE? -Yep. -You don't say much do you?
tt0816692,"01:05:28,713","01:05:33,009",TARS talks plenty for both of us. -Detach.
tt0816692,"01:05:39,889","01:05:43,187","Romilly, are you reading these forces? -Unbelievable."
tt0816692,"01:05:46,930","01:05:48,622",A literal heart of darkness.
tt0816692,"01:05:51,504","01:05:55,777","If we could just see the collapsed star inside,"
tt0816692,"01:05:55,925","01:05:58,798","the singularity, we'd solve gravity."
tt0816692,"01:05:58,911","01:06:02,265","We can't get anything from it? -Nothing escapes that horizon,"
tt0816692,"01:06:02,416","01:06:06,317","not even light. All the answers are there, just no way to see it."
tt0816692,"01:06:06,469","01:06:07,827",There's Miller's planet.
tt0816692,"01:06:10,395","01:06:11,357",Goodbye Ranger.
tt0816692,"01:06:24,117","01:06:28,549",This is fast for atmospheric entry. Shouldn't we use the thrusters to slow?
tt0816692,"01:06:28,629","01:06:32,710",-No. I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics to save some fuel.
tt0816692,"01:06:32,819","01:06:35,849",Air-brake? -We wanna get down fast don't we?
tt0816692,"01:06:35,957","01:06:39,352",Actually we wanna get there in one piece. -Hang on.
tt0816692,"01:06:39,425","01:06:41,110","Brand, Doyle, get ready."
tt0816692,"01:06:56,945","01:06:59,677",We should be using the air-brake. -Hands up CASE.
tt0816692,"01:06:59,757","01:07:03,176",The only time I ever went down is when a machine was easing at the wrong time.
tt0816692,"01:07:03,290","01:07:06,406",You're going to get us killed. -Just like reckless driving.
tt0816692,"01:07:06,682","01:07:08,323",We're too fast. -I got this.
tt0816692,"01:07:13,055","01:07:17,126",Should I get ready to detach? -No. I need to feel the air.
tt0816692,"01:07:21,131","01:07:22,326",Here we go.
tt0816692,"01:07:23,771","01:07:26,574",It's just water!
tt0816692,"01:07:26,683","01:07:31,430",The stuff of life. -1200 meters.
tt0816692,"01:07:31,547","01:07:34,622","Do we have a fix on her beacon? -That I have, can you maneuver?"
tt0816692,"01:07:34,731","01:07:39,534","I gonna need to shave some speed. I'm gonna spiral down on top of it, everybody hang on!"
tt0816692,"01:07:40,941","01:07:42,855",700
tt0816692,"01:07:44,801","01:07:47,154","On my cue CASE, on my cue."
tt0816692,"01:07:49,988","01:07:51,429",500 meters.
tt0816692,"01:08:00,614","01:08:02,056",Now!
tt0816692,"01:08:16,132","01:08:17,381",Very graceful.
tt0816692,"01:08:17,451","01:08:21,873","No, but very efficient."
tt0816692,"01:08:23,331","01:08:26,081",What're you waiting for? Let's go.
tt0816692,"01:08:26,151","01:08:29,862","Go, go, go, go. 7 years per hour here."
tt0816692,"01:08:29,969","01:08:31,262",Let's make it count.
tt0816692,"01:08:57,449","01:08:58,336",This way.
tt0816692,"01:09:00,965","01:09:03,055",About 200 meters.
tt0816692,"01:09:13,062","01:09:17,664",Gravity's punishing. -Been floating through space too long?
tt0816692,"01:09:17,777","01:09:20,078",130% Earth's gravity.
tt0816692,"01:09:21,450","01:09:22,834","Come on, come on, come on."
tt0816692,"01:09:24,996","01:09:27,407",There's nothing here. -should be right here.
tt0816692,"01:09:29,075","01:09:32,537","If the, if the signal's coming from here, then..."
tt0816692,"01:09:41,939","01:09:43,128",Her beacon.
tt0816692,"01:09:51,083","01:09:54,360",Wreckage. -Where's the rest?
tt0816692,"01:09:54,433","01:09:56,165",Towards the mountains.
tt0816692,"01:09:59,483","01:10:01,533",Those aren't mountains.
tt0816692,"01:10:04,048","01:10:06,395",They're waves. -What?
tt0816692,"01:10:09,894","01:10:11,372",Shit.
tt0816692,"01:10:13,467","01:10:15,588",That one's moving away from us.
tt0816692,"01:10:20,665","01:10:23,433",We need the recorder.
tt0816692,"01:10:33,625","01:10:36,326","Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!"
tt0816692,"01:10:36,404","01:10:38,674","I'm not, leaving, without, her data."
tt0816692,"01:10:40,012","01:10:44,278",Get back here now. We do not have time. The second wave is coming!
tt0816692,"01:10:44,391","01:10:46,866",We are in the middle of a swell!
tt0816692,"01:10:46,975","01:10:50,752",Get your ass back to the Ranger now!
tt0816692,"01:10:54,285","01:10:57,591",Brand get back here now!!
tt0816692,"01:10:59,026","01:11:02,937","Cooper, go, Cooper go, I can't make it. Go!"
tt0816692,"01:11:03,050","01:11:04,270","CASE, go get her."
tt0816692,"01:11:08,360","01:11:11,634","GO! -Get up, get up Brand."
tt0816692,"01:11:11,779","01:11:13,494","Go go, go."
tt0816692,"01:11:14,686","01:11:18,350",I'm not gonna make it! -Yes you are. Yes you are!
tt0816692,"01:11:24,990","01:11:27,573","Come on CASE has her, CASE has her! Get back here Doyle!"
tt0816692,"01:11:30,346","01:11:31,821",Dr. Brand.
tt0816692,"01:11:33,515","01:11:35,275",To the hatch.
tt0816692,"01:11:39,360","01:11:41,302","Go, go. Go."
tt0816692,"01:11:46,824","01:11:50,861",Manually overriding inside hatch!
tt0816692,"01:11:54,208","01:11:58,918",Cooper don't! Cooper don't!
tt0816692,"01:11:59,081","01:12:00,152",Cooper!
tt0816692,"01:12:02,001","01:12:05,848",Engines are flooded! I'll have to shut it down!
tt0816692,"01:12:38,989","01:12:40,644",Oh shit!!
tt0816692,"01:12:45,428","01:12:46,761",Whoaa!
tt0816692,"01:13:17,867","01:13:21,064","CASE what's wrong? -Chute's waterlogged, let it drain."
tt0816692,"01:13:21,895","01:13:25,457",Goddamn it!! I told you to leave me.
tt0816692,"01:13:25,569","01:13:27,974",-And I told you to get your ass back here!
tt0816692,"01:13:28,048","01:13:31,669",The difference is that one of us was thinkin' about the mission.
tt0816692,"01:13:31,778","01:13:33,619",-You were thinking about getting home!!
tt0816692,"01:13:34,642","01:13:39,614",I was trying to do the right thing! -Can you tell that to Doyle?
tt0816692,"01:13:41,551","01:13:44,504","CASE, how much time? -45 to an hour."
tt0816692,"01:13:45,911","01:13:47,626",The stuff of life huh?
tt0816692,"01:13:48,674","01:13:51,610",What's this gonna cost us Brand? -A lot.
tt0816692,"01:13:52,493","01:13:53,308",Decades.
tt0816692,"01:14:00,503","01:14:03,384",What happened to Miller? -Judging by...
tt0816692,"01:14:03,499","01:14:07,307",...the wreckage she was broken up by a wave soon after impact.
tt0816692,"01:14:07,417","01:14:10,878","How's the hell the wreckage stayed together after all these years, huh?"
tt0816692,"01:14:12,141","01:14:13,722",Because of the time slippage.
tt0816692,"01:14:13,869","01:14:17,491","On this planet's time she,"
tt0816692,"01:14:17,603","01:14:19,624","she's landed hours ago, she..."
tt0816692,"01:14:19,699","01:14:22,653",...she probably just died minutes ago.
tt0816692,"01:14:22,764","01:14:26,609",The data Doyle received was just the initial status echoing endlessly.
tt0816692,"01:14:26,720","01:14:29,092",Oh we are not prepared for this.
tt0816692,"01:14:31,509","01:14:35,784",You eggheads have the survival skills of a boy-scout troop.
tt0816692,"01:14:35,816","01:14:38,904","Well we got this far on our brains, farther than any human in history."
tt0816692,"01:14:39,224","01:14:43,573",Well not far enough. And now we're stuck here till there won't be anyone...
tt0816692,"01:14:43,574","01:14:44,760",...left on Earth to save.
tt0816692,"01:14:46,683","01:14:50,242",I'm counting every minute same as you Cooper.
tt0816692,"01:14:53,993","01:14:58,875","Is there any possibility? I dunno, maybe some way, I don't know..."
tt0816692,"01:14:58,876","01:15:03,000",...maybe if we could jump in a black hole and gain back the years?
tt0816692,"01:14:14,502","01:14:17,857","Don't shake your head at me! Time is relative, okay."
tt0816692,"01:15:06,965","01:15:09,212","It can stretch and it can squeeze, but,"
tt0816692,"01:15:09,282","01:15:13,031",it can't run backwards! Just can't!
tt0816692,"01:15:13,109","01:15:17,300","The only thing that can move across dimensions, like time, is gravity."
tt0816692,"01:15:19,612","01:15:20,939",Okay.
tt0816692,"01:15:22,809","01:15:25,508","The beings that led us here,"
tt0816692,"01:15:25,619","01:15:28,712","they communicate through gravity, right?"
tt0816692,"01:15:28,863","01:15:32,786",Could they be talking to us from the future? -Maybe.
tt0816692,"01:15:32,899","01:15:36,403","Okay, if they can..? They..."
tt0816692,"01:15:36,518","01:15:39,171",...are beings of 5 dimensions!
tt0816692,"01:15:39,288","01:15:42,904","Right, to them, time might be yet another physical dimension."
tt0816692,"01:15:42,991","01:15:47,532","To them, the past might be a canyon they can climb into,"
tt0816692,"01:15:47,638","01:15:52,360","and the future, a mountain that they can climb up, but to us, it's not! Okay!"
tt0816692,"01:15:52,435","01:15:56,376","Look Cooper, I screwed up. I'm sorry."
tt0816692,"01:15:57,674","01:15:59,721",But you knew about relativity.
tt0816692,"01:16:02,533","01:16:03,509",Brand.
tt0816692,"01:16:07,627","01:16:10,586",My daughter is 10 years old.
tt0816692,"01:16:10,701","01:16:13,962","Couldn't teach her Einstein's theories before I left,"
tt0816692,"01:16:13,997","01:16:18,643",Couldn't you have told your daughter that you were going to save the world? -No.
tt0816692,"01:16:19,768","01:16:24,476","When you become a parent, one thing becomes really clear,"
tt0816692,"01:16:25,460","01:16:29,273","And that's you wanna make sure your children feel safe,"
tt0816692,"01:16:30,281","01:16:34,101","and it rules out telling a 10 year old, that the world's endin'."
tt0816692,"01:16:36,416","01:16:37,421",Cooper.
tt0816692,"01:16:41,141","01:16:44,543",How long for the engines CASE? -A minute or two.
tt0816692,"01:16:44,618","01:16:46,790",Well we don't have it! Helmets on!!
tt0816692,"01:16:50,473","01:16:55,283","Brand, co-pilot you're up. CASE, run the cabin oxygen through the main thrusters."
tt0816692,"01:16:55,394","01:16:57,346",We're gonna spark it! -Roger that.
tt0816692,"01:16:57,459","01:16:58,658",Depressurizing.
tt0816692,"01:17:03,950","01:17:05,172",Engines up!
tt0816692,"01:17:34,169","01:17:38,086",Hello Rom! -I've waited years.
tt0816692,"01:17:39,236","01:17:40,807","How many, how many years?"
tt0816692,"01:17:42,444","01:17:47,416","By now it must be, 23 years, 4 months, 8 days."
tt0816692,"01:17:51,166","01:17:52,461",Doyle?
tt0816692,"01:17:59,562","01:18:02,914",I thought I was prepared...I knew the theory...
tt0816692,"01:18:02,985","01:18:05,501",...reality is different.
tt0816692,"01:18:06,518","01:18:07,373",And Miller?
tt0816692,"01:18:08,678","01:18:10,548",There's nothing here for us.
tt0816692,"01:18:14,229","01:18:18,077",Why didn't you sleep? -Oh I had a couple of stretches.
tt0816692,"01:18:18,150","01:18:21,037",I stopped believing that you were coming back.
tt0816692,"01:18:21,116","01:18:23,954",Something seemed wrong about dreaming my life away.
tt0816692,"01:18:24,023","01:18:27,017",I learned what I could from the black hole
tt0816692,"01:18:27,160","01:18:29,488",but I couldn't send anything to your father.
tt0816692,"01:18:29,600","01:18:34,370",We've been receiving but nothing gets out. -Is he alive?
tt0816692,"01:18:34,453","01:18:37,416","Oh, yeah. -Yeah? -Yeah."
tt0816692,"01:18:40,080","01:18:44,342",We've got years of messages stored. -Cooper.
tt0816692,"01:18:44,451","01:18:47,804",Messages span 23 years.
tt0816692,"01:18:49,420","01:18:51,359",Play from the beginning.
tt0816692,"01:18:54,732","01:18:59,551","Hey Dad, Just checkin' in, sayin' hi."
tt0816692,"01:19:00,856","01:19:04,198","Umm, finished 2nd in school,"
tt0816692,"01:19:04,308","01:19:07,906","Miss Carlin's still giving me Cs though,"
tt0816692,"01:19:08,055","01:19:11,213","pulled me down, but second's not bad."
tt0816692,"01:19:12,364","01:19:14,631",Grandpa attended the ceremony.
tt0816692,"01:19:16,227","01:19:20,709","Umm, oh, I met another girl dad."
tt0816692,"01:19:20,752","01:19:25,769","I uh, I really think this is the one."
tt0816692,"01:19:26,286","01:19:28,901",Her name is Lois. That's her right there.
tt0816692,"01:19:32,575","01:19:34,195","Murphy stole grandpa's car,"
tt0816692,"01:19:34,303","01:19:37,971","She crashed it, she's okay though."
tt0816692,"01:19:38,042","01:19:42,838",Hey Dad. Look at this!
tt0816692,"01:19:42,917","01:19:47,272",You're a grandpa! His name's Jesse.
tt0816692,"01:19:47,377","01:19:52,528","I wanted to go with Coop, but Lois says maybe next time."
tt0816692,"01:19:52,651","01:19:55,103","And Donald says he's already got the 'great' part so,"
tt0816692,"01:19:55,176","01:19:57,637",we're not to call him that.
tt0816692,"01:19:57,752","01:20:01,797",
tt0816692,"01:19:12,870","01:19:15,755",Say goodbye to Grandpa.
tt0816692,"01:20:04,861","01:20:07,815",Goodbye grandpa.
tt0816692,"01:20:07,890","01:20:09,725","Sorry, it's been a while."
tt0816692,"01:20:10,945","01:20:17,016","It's..., what with Jesse and all..."
tt0816692,"01:20:21,466","01:20:25,776","Uhh, grandpa died last week."
tt0816692,"01:20:25,883","01:20:28,548",We buried him out in the back 40 next to mom...
tt0816692,"01:20:28,549","01:20:31,110",...and Jesse.
tt0816692,"01:20:32,490","01:20:37,018","Which is where we would've buried you, if you would've ever,... come back."
tt0816692,"01:20:38,167","01:20:40,468",Murph was there at the funeral.
tt0816692,"01:20:41,478","01:20:44,130","We don't see her that much, but she came for that."
tt0816692,"01:20:47,350","01:20:50,067","You're not listening to this, I know."
tt0816692,"01:20:53,069","01:20:58,606","All these messages are just, ... drifting..."
tt0816692,"01:20:58,713","01:21:00,977",out there in the darkness.
tt0816692,"01:21:01,085","01:21:07,179","Lois says that, uh... I have to let you go."
tt0816692,"01:21:08,369","01:21:09,376",And uh...
tt0816692,"01:21:10,688","01:21:11,524",...so...
tt0816692,"01:21:14,082","01:21:18,026",I guess... I'll let you go.
tt0816692,"01:21:19,076","01:21:21,267",I don't know where you're dad.
tt0816692,"01:21:21,377","01:21:24,941",But I hope that you're at peace. And...
tt0816692,"01:21:25,052","01:21:27,559",Goodbye.
tt0816692,"01:21:39,993","01:21:42,220",Hey Dad.
tt0816692,"01:21:45,284","01:21:48,202",Hey Murph. -You son of a bitch!
tt0816692,"01:21:51,599","01:21:54,899","I never made one of these when you were still responding,"
tt0816692,"01:21:54,900","01:21:56,773",because I was so mad at you for leaving.
tt0816692,"01:21:59,175","01:22:02,013","And then when you went quiet,"
tt0816692,"01:22:04,819","01:22:07,945","it felt like I should've lived with that decision, and I have,"
tt0816692,"01:22:11,913","01:22:14,525","but today is my birthday,"
tt0816692,"01:22:17,818","01:22:21,562","And it's a special one, because you told me,"
tt0816692,"01:22:24,499","01:22:27,842",you once told me that when you come back...
tt0816692,"01:22:27,956","01:22:29,869",...we might be the same age.
tt0816692,"01:22:31,569","01:22:34,753",And today I'm the age you were when you left.
tt0816692,"01:22:37,641","01:22:41,019",So it would be a real good time for you to come back!
tt0816692,"01:22:53,191","01:22:55,660","I didn't mean to intrude,"
tt0816692,"01:22:56,596","01:23:00,748",It's just that I've never seen you in here before. -Because I've never been in here before.
tt0816692,"01:23:03,124","01:23:07,580","I talk to Amelia, all the time. It helps."
tt0816692,"01:23:07,731","01:23:11,803",I'm glad you've started. -I haven't.
tt0816692,"01:23:11,915","01:23:16,282",Just had something which needed to get out. -I know they're still out there.
tt0816692,"01:23:16,391","01:23:16,685",I know.
tt0816692,"01:23:16,802","01:23:21,646",There are so many reasons why our communications might not be getting through.
tt0816692,"01:23:21,763","01:23:22,944",I know Professor.
tt0816692,"01:23:23,058","01:23:27,092","I'm not sure, what I'm more afraid of."
tt0816692,"01:23:27,205","01:23:30,200",Them never coming back or...
tt0816692,"01:23:30,270","01:23:34,351",...coming back to find we've failed.
tt0816692,"01:23:34,464","01:23:37,861","Then let's succeed. -So,"
tt0816692,"01:23:37,968","01:23:42,867",back to the fourth iteration. Let's run it through some new fields.
tt0816692,"01:23:42,978","01:23:46,558","With respect Professor, we've tried that hundreds of times."
tt0816692,"01:23:46,670","01:23:50,189",#NAME?
tt0816692,"01:23:53,433","01:23:56,844",Every rivet that they strike could've been a bullet.
tt0816692,"01:23:56,921","01:23:59,990","We've done well, in the world here,"
tt0816692,"01:24:00,098","01:24:04,155","whether or not we crack the equation, before I kick the bucket."
tt0816692,"01:24:04,268","01:24:07,939",Don't be morbid Professor. -I'm not afraid of death.
tt0816692,"01:24:08,047","01:24:09,810",I am an old physicist.
tt0816692,"01:24:11,444","01:24:13,096",I'm afraid of time.
tt0816692,"01:24:19,732","01:24:21,434",Time.
tt0816692,"01:24:23,616","01:24:25,449",You're afraid of time.
tt0816692,"01:24:27,400","01:24:30,460",For years we've been trying to solve the equation without changing...
tt0816692,"01:24:30,547","01:24:33,139",...the underlying assumption about time. -And?
tt0816692,"01:24:33,293","01:24:37,252","What it means, is each iteration is an attempt to prove it's own proof,"
tt0816692,"01:24:37,330","01:24:41,200","it's recursive,...it's nonsensical."
tt0816692,"01:24:41,340","01:24:45,047","Are you calling my life's work nonsense, Murph?"
tt0816692,"01:24:46,329","01:24:49,374","No, I'm saying that you've been trying to finish it with one arm..."
tt0816692,"01:24:49,375","01:24:53,190","...no, with both arms tied behind your back."
tt0816692,"01:24:54,623","01:24:56,212",And I don't understand why.
tt0816692,"01:24:57,325","01:24:59,115",I am an old man Murph.
tt0816692,"01:24:59,224","01:25:02,751",Can we take this point up at another time?
tt0816692,"01:25:02,862","01:25:04,914",I want to talk to my daughter.
tt0816692,"01:25:06,429","01:25:09,810","Stepping out into the universe,"
tt0816692,"01:25:09,927","01:25:14,050",we must confront the reality of tt0816692 travel.
tt0816692,"01:25:14,162","01:25:18,296",We must reach far beyond our own lifespans.
tt0816692,"01:25:19,557","01:25:22,304","We must think, not as individuals,"
tt0816692,"01:25:22,416","01:25:24,614",but as a species.
tt0816692,"01:25:25,946","01:25:30,937",'Do not go gentle into that good night.'
tt0816692,"01:25:31,486","01:25:34,588",TARS kept the Endurance right where we needed her...
tt0816692,"01:25:34,663","01:25:37,398",...but the trip took years longer than what we anticipated.
tt0816692,"01:25:37,507","01:25:40,334","We no longer have the fuel to visit both our prospects,"
tt0816692,"01:25:40,410","01:25:42,993","so, we've got to choose."
tt0816692,"01:25:44,648","01:25:45,228",But how?
tt0816692,"01:25:46,595","01:25:48,076",They're both promising.
tt0816692,"01:25:49,378","01:25:51,769","And Edmunds data is better,"
tt0816692,"01:25:51,770","01:25:54,553",but Dr. Mann is the one who's still transmitting. So...
tt0816692,"01:25:54,663","01:25:57,474",We've got no reason to suspect Edmunds data would've soured.
tt0816692,"01:25:58,592","01:26:02,804",His world has key elements to sustain human life. -As does Dr. Mann's.
tt0816692,"01:26:02,877","01:26:04,245","Cooper, this is my field."
tt0816692,"01:26:05,730","01:26:10,245",And I really believe Edmund's is the better prospect. -Why?
tt0816692,"01:26:10,358","01:26:15,350","Gargantua, that's why. Look at Miller's planet."
tt0816692,"01:26:15,461","01:26:19,654","Hydrocarbons, organics, yes; But no life. Sterile."
tt0816692,"01:26:19,668","01:26:24,511",We'll find the same thing on Mann's. -Because of the black hole?
tt0816692,"01:26:24,587","01:26:28,087","-Murphy's Law. Whatever can happen, will happen."
tt0816692,"01:26:28,195","01:26:30,865","Accidents are the first building block of evolution,"
tt0816692,"01:26:31,017","01:26:34,398","but when you're orbiting a black hole, not enough can happen,"
tt0816692,"01:26:34,513","01:26:38,378","it sucks in asteroids, comets, other events which would otherwise reach you."
tt0816692,"01:26:38,487","01:26:39,767",We need to go further afield.
tt0816692,"01:26:40,516","01:26:46,301","You once said that Dr. Mann, was the best of us."
tt0816692,"01:26:46,411","01:26:50,058",He is remarkable. we're only here because of him.
tt0816692,"01:26:50,165","01:26:53,440","And, and yet here he is, he is on the ground,"
tt0816692,"01:26:53,588","01:26:58,209","and he's sending a very unambiguous message, telling us to come to his planet."
tt0816692,"01:26:59,194","01:27:03,954",-Granted. But Edmund's data is more promising.
tt0816692,"01:27:04,027","01:27:07,834","-We should vote. -Well, if we're going to vote, there's something you should know,"
tt0816692,"01:27:07,944","01:27:11,447","Brand, he has a right to know."
tt0816692,"01:27:11,521","01:27:14,953",That has nothing to do with it. -What does?
tt0816692,"01:27:15,066","01:27:18,210",She's in love with Wolf Edmunds. -Is that true?
tt0816692,"01:27:18,323","01:27:19,545",Yes.
tt0816692,"01:27:22,293","01:27:25,460",And that makes me want to follow my heart.
tt0816692,"01:27:28,633","01:27:32,678","Maybe we've spent too long trying to figure all this out with theory,"
tt0816692,"01:27:32,756","01:27:35,881","-You're a scientist Brand. -So listen to me,"
tt0816692,"01:27:35,996","01:27:40,640","When I say that love isn't something we invented, it's..."
tt0816692,"01:27:40,752","01:27:44,314","...observable, powerful."
tt0816692,"01:27:46,227","01:27:50,933","It has to mean something. -Love has meaning, yes, social utility..."
tt0816692,"01:27:50,934","01:27:54,521","...social bonding, child rearing, -We love people who have died,"
tt0816692,"01:27:54,628","01:27:58,565",where's the social utility in that? -None.
tt0816692,"01:27:58,676","01:28:01,473","-Maybe it means something more, something we can't..."
tt0816692,"01:28:01,546","01:28:04,566",...yet understand.
tt0816692,"01:28:04,633","01:28:07,977","Maybe it's, some evidence, some..."
tt0816692,"01:28:08,855","01:28:13,626","...artifact of a higher dimension... that we can't consciously perceive,"
tt0816692,"01:28:13,749","01:28:16,651",I'm drawn across the universe to someone...
tt0816692,"01:28:16,724","01:28:21,351","...I haven't seen in a decade. Who, I know, is probably dead."
tt0816692,"01:28:21,462","01:28:24,485",Love is the one thing we're capable...
tt0816692,"01:28:24,555","01:28:27,778",...of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space.
tt0816692,"01:28:29,041","01:28:32,107","Maybe we should trust that,"
tt0816692,"01:28:32,178","01:28:35,110",even if we can't understand it yet.
tt0816692,"01:28:38,591","01:28:40,821","Alright Cooper,"
tt0816692,"01:28:43,238","01:28:44,176",Yes!
tt0816692,"01:28:45,687","01:28:48,895",The tiniest possibility of seeing Wolf again excites me.
tt0816692,"01:28:49,116","01:28:53,843","But that doesn't mean I'm wrong. -Honestly Amelia,"
tt0816692,"01:28:55,757","01:28:57,122",it might.
tt0816692,"01:29:02,842","01:29:06,615","TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's."
tt0816692,"01:29:22,790","01:29:31,891","We'll lose about a third again. Next year. Next year, I'm gonna work Nelson's farm and I'm gonna make it up."
tt0816692,"01:29:32,004","01:29:33,910",What happened to Nelson?
tt0816692,"01:29:39,708","01:29:44,608","Murph, can I get you anything? Would you like some more Soufflé? -No, I'm full. Thanks."
tt0816692,"01:29:44,719","01:29:45,583",It was delicious.
tt0816692,"01:29:46,987","01:29:48,426",Hand me that donut please.
tt0816692,"01:29:50,551","01:29:54,993",Will you spend the night? Your room is exactly as you left it. It's...
tt0816692,"01:29:55,028","01:29:58,379","-I need to get back. -My sewing machine is in there, but there's plenty..."
tt0816692,"01:29:58,449","01:30:01,454",#NAME?
tt0816692,"01:30:02,892","01:30:07,037","...too many memories. -Well, we have something for that."
tt0816692,"01:30:07,153","01:30:08,405",
tt0816692,"01:29:26,812","01:29:27,915",Dust.
tt0816692,"01:30:18,535","01:30:21,811","Lois, I have a friend who could..."
tt0816692,"01:30:21,891","01:30:24,080",...look at his lungs.
tt0816692,"01:30:42,236","01:30:45,263","Amelia, I'm sorry. -You're just being objective."
tt0816692,"01:30:45,335","01:30:48,530","Unless you're punishing me, for screwing up on Miller's planet,"
tt0816692,"01:30:48,733","01:30:50,737","-No, this wasn't a personal decision."
tt0816692,"01:30:50,813","01:30:55,272","Well, if you're wrong, you have a very personal decision to make."
tt0816692,"01:30:55,383","01:30:59,415",Your fuel calculations are based on a return journey.
tt0816692,"01:30:59,524","01:31:02,464",Strike out on Mann's planet and you'll have to decide whether...
tt0816692,"01:31:02,539","01:31:06,026","...to return home, or push onto Edmunds with plan B."
tt0816692,"01:31:06,190","01:31:09,999",Starting a colony could save us from extinction.
tt0816692,"01:31:10,113","01:31:12,853",You might have to decide between seeing your children again...
tt0816692,"01:31:12,964","01:31:14,901",...or the future of the human race.
tt0816692,"01:31:16,052","01:31:17,973",I trust you'll be as objective then.
tt0816692,"01:31:24,122","01:31:27,397",He has been asking for you since he came to.
tt0816692,"01:31:27,472","01:31:28,770",We were trying to reach you.
tt0816692,"01:31:34,461","01:31:38,155",Murph? -Hey. I'm here Professor.
tt0816692,"01:31:38,264","01:31:41,644",I think I let all down.
tt0816692,"01:31:41,758","01:31:44,820","No, you got us this far. We're close."
tt0816692,"01:31:46,161","01:31:48,399",I will finish what you started.
tt0816692,"01:31:48,513","01:31:51,630","Good, good Murph."
tt0816692,"01:31:51,744","01:31:55,938",You had faith.
tt0816692,"01:31:56,011","01:32:01,484","All those, all those years,"
tt0816692,"01:32:02,356","01:32:06,483","I asked you to have faith,"
tt0816692,"01:32:07,609","01:32:18,635","I wanted you to believe, that your father,... would come back."
tt0816692,"01:32:19,032","01:32:20,903",I do Professor.
tt0816692,"01:32:22,637","01:32:26,559",Forgive me Murph. -There's nothing to forgive.
tt0816692,"01:32:28,467","01:32:33,286","I lied Murph,"
tt0816692,"01:32:34,405","01:32:36,716",I lied to you.
tt0816692,"01:32:42,441","01:32:49,399","There was no need for him, to come back."
tt0816692,"01:32:50,570","01:32:55,786",There's no way to help us.
tt0816692,"01:32:55,859","01:32:59,193",But the Plan A? All this?
tt0816692,"01:33:00,029","01:33:04,570",All these people. And the equation?
tt0816692,"01:33:07,546","01:33:09,881",Did my father know?
tt0816692,"01:33:12,761","01:33:15,383",Did he leave me?
tt0816692,"01:33:18,050","01:33:28,204",'Do....not....go....gentle....'
tt0816692,"01:33:28,396","01:33:34,176",No. NO!
tt0816692,"01:33:34,294","01:33:38,595",You can't leave. NO!!
tt0816692,"01:33:38,705","01:33:42,801","Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you that your father died today."
tt0816692,"01:33:42,908","01:33:46,007",He didn't feel any pain. He was at peace.
tt0816692,"01:33:46,087","01:33:48,854",I'm very sorry for your loss.
tt0816692,"01:34:01,439","01:34:03,637",Brand did you know?
tt0816692,"01:34:05,154","01:34:07,431",He told you right?
tt0816692,"01:34:09,032","01:34:11,692",You knew?
tt0816692,"01:34:12,743","01:34:15,191",This was all a sham.
tt0816692,"01:34:19,826","01:34:21,444",You left us here.
tt0816692,"01:34:22,782","01:34:25,263",To suffocate.
tt0816692,"01:34:26,522","01:34:28,354",To starve.
tt0816692,"01:34:55,363","01:34:57,534",Frozen cloud.
tt0816692,"01:37:21,492","01:37:24,756",It's okay.
tt0816692,"01:37:30,013","01:37:33,026",It's okay.
tt0816692,"01:37:33,144","01:37:35,086",It's okay.
tt0816692,"01:37:37,882","01:37:40,167","Pray you never learn,"
tt0816692,"01:37:41,542","01:37:44,522",just how good it can be to see another face.
tt0816692,"01:37:52,707","01:37:57,997",I hadn't had a lot of hope to begin with. After so long I had none.
tt0816692,"01:37:59,727","01:38:02,460",My supplies were completely exhausted.
tt0816692,"01:38:04,338","01:38:08,535","The last time I went to sleep, I didn't even set up a waking date."
tt0816692,"01:38:12,291","01:38:14,993",You've literally raised me from the dead.
tt0816692,"01:38:16,008","01:38:17,228",Lazarus.
tt0816692,"01:38:18,384","01:38:22,372",What about the others? -I'm afraid you're it sir.
tt0816692,"01:38:23,385","01:38:25,302","So far, surely."
tt0816692,"01:38:25,878","01:38:28,556",No. In our present situation...
tt0816692,"01:38:28,669","01:38:31,363",...there's very little chance of rescuing any others.
tt0816692,"01:38:34,452","01:38:35,873",Dr. Mann.
tt0816692,"01:38:36,243","01:38:39,508","Dr. Mann, tell us about your world."
tt0816692,"01:38:42,702","01:38:44,757","Our world, we hope..."
tt0816692,"01:38:47,146","01:38:56,239","Our world is cold, stark, but undeniably beautiful."
tt0816692,"01:38:58,158","01:39:01,488","The days are 67 hours long, cold."
tt0816692,"01:39:05,378","01:39:09,297",The nights are 67 far colder hours.
tt0816692,"01:39:14,302","01:39:20,217","The gravity is a very, very pleasant 80% of the Earth's."
tt0816692,"01:39:20,331","01:39:23,502","Now here, where I landed, the water is alkali."
tt0816692,"01:39:23,619","01:39:27,316",And the air has too much ammonia in it to breathe for more than just a few minutes.
tt0816692,"01:39:27,317","01:39:31,996","But, down at the surface, and there is, a surface,"
tt0816692,"01:39:32,066","01:39:36,643","the chlorine dissipates, the ammonia gives way to crystalline hydrocarbons."
tt0816692,"01:39:36,751","01:39:39,486","Breathable air, to organics."
tt0816692,"01:39:39,596","01:39:42,333","Possibly even, to life."
tt0816692,"01:39:42,414","01:39:45,258",We might be sharing this world.
tt0816692,"01:39:45,370","01:39:47,654",These readings are from the surface?
tt0816692,"01:39:47,770","01:39:52,487","Over the years, I've dropped various probes. -How far have you explored?"
tt0816692,"01:39:52,596","01:39:55,547","I have managed several major expeditions, but with oxygen in..."
tt0816692,"01:39:55,621","01:40:00,567","...limited supply, KIPP there, really did most of the legwork. -What went wrong with him sir?"
tt0816692,"01:40:00,646","01:40:03,471",Degeneration. He misidentified the first organics...
tt0816692,"01:40:03,472","01:40:08,436","...we found as ammonia crystals. We struggled on for a time, but..."
tt0816692,"01:40:08,510","01:40:12,405","...ultimately I decommissioned him, used his power source to keep the mission going."
tt0816692,"01:40:12,594","01:40:16,770",I thought I was alone before I even shut him down. -Would you like me to take a look at him?
tt0816692,"01:40:16,842","01:40:20,190","No, no, needs a human touch."
tt0816692,"01:40:20,262","01:40:22,511","Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message..."
tt0816692,"01:40:22,512","01:40:26,800","...for you, from the spaceship. -Okay, be right there. Excuse me."
tt0816692,"01:40:39,119","01:40:42,392","Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you that your father died today."
tt0816692,"01:40:42,505","01:40:48,199",He had no pain. He was at peace.
tt0816692,"01:40:50,516","01:40:52,501",I'm sorry for your loss.
tt0816692,"01:40:54,880","01:40:59,714","Is that Murph? -She's,...she's grown!"
tt0816692,"01:40:59,787","01:41:00,798",Brand did you know?
tt0816692,"01:41:02,206","01:41:03,721",He told you right?
tt0816692,"01:41:06,063","01:41:08,073",You knew?
tt0816692,"01:41:09,597","01:41:13,851",This was all a sham. You left us here.
tt0816692,"01:41:15,006","01:41:17,669",To suffocate.
tt0816692,"01:41:19,370","01:41:21,070",To starve.
tt0816692,"01:41:24,777","01:41:26,330",Did my father know too?
tt0816692,"01:41:28,601","01:41:29,789",Dad!
tt0816692,"01:41:32,026","01:41:37,997","I just want to know, if you left me here to die?"
tt0816692,"01:41:39,157","01:41:42,080",I just have to know!
tt0816692,"01:41:47,197","01:41:55,934","Cooper, my father dedicated his whole life to plan A, I have..."
tt0816692,"01:41:56,009","01:41:58,131",...no idea what she's talking about.
tt0816692,"01:41:59,217","01:42:00,702",I do.
tt0816692,"01:42:05,133","01:42:09,017","He, he never even hoped to get the people off the Earth?"
tt0816692,"01:42:09,090","01:42:10,708",No.
tt0816692,"01:42:15,180","01:42:18,991",But he has been trying to solve the gravity equation for 40 years.
tt0816692,"01:42:19,100","01:42:23,312","Amelia, your father solved his equation before I even left."
tt0816692,"01:42:23,386","01:42:25,302",Then why wouldn't he use it?
tt0816692,"01:42:25,411","01:42:29,878",The equation couldn't reconcile relativity with quantum mechanics You need more.
tt0816692,"01:42:29,951","01:42:34,574",More? More what? -More data. You need to see into a black hole.
tt0816692,"01:42:34,575","01:42:38,715","The laws of nature prohibit a naked singularity. -Romilly, is that true?"
tt0816692,"01:42:39,553","01:42:43,793","If the black hole is an oyster, then the singularity is the pearl inside."
tt0816692,"01:42:43,960","01:42:46,213",The gravity is so strong that it is always hidden...
tt0816692,"01:42:46,286","01:42:48,045","...in darkness, beyond the horizon."
tt0816692,"01:42:49,136","01:42:51,366",That's why we call it a 'black' hole.
tt0816692,"01:42:51,475","01:42:55,700","Okay,...what if we see beyond the horizon?"
tt0816692,"01:42:55,775","01:42:59,862",We can't Cooper. -There are some things that aren't meant to be known.
tt0816692,"01:42:59,970","01:43:04,397",Your father had to find another way to save the human race from extinction.
tt0816692,"01:43:04,440","01:43:07,964","Plan B, a colony. -But why not tell people?"
tt0816692,"01:43:09,413","01:43:10,793",Why keep it from us?
tt0816692,"01:43:10,907","01:43:13,283",Because he knew how hard it would be to get people...
tt0816692,"01:43:13,284","01:43:18,282",...to work together to save the species instead of themselves. Or their children.
tt0816692,"01:43:18,387","01:43:19,471",Bullshit!
tt0816692,"01:43:19,579","01:43:22,324",You never would have come here unless you believed you were gonna save them.
tt0816692,"01:43:22,438","01:43:25,198",Evolution has yet to transcend that simple barrier.
tt0816692,"01:43:25,272","01:43:29,482","We can care deeply, selflessly about those we know."
tt0816692,"01:43:29,553","01:43:33,911",But that empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight. -But the lie?
tt0816692,"01:43:37,263","01:43:41,839",That monstrous lie? -Unforgivable.
tt0816692,"01:43:41,951","01:43:46,738","And he knew that. He was prepared to destroy his own humanity,"
tt0816692,"01:43:46,850","01:43:50,342","in order to save the species, he made an incredible sacrifice."
tt0816692,"01:43:50,456","01:43:54,950","NO! No, an incredible sacrifice is being made,"
tt0816692,"01:43:55,025","01:43:57,929",by the people on Earth who're gonna die!
tt0816692,"01:43:57,936","01:44:02,581","Because in his fucking arrogance, he declared their case hopeless."
tt0816692,"01:44:02,688","01:44:07,145","I'm sorry Cooper, their case is hopeless."
tt0816692,"01:44:07,187","01:44:11,413",No. No. -We are the future.
tt0816692,"01:44:12,852","01:44:14,073",Cooper.
tt0816692,"01:44:15,201","01:44:16,752","Cooper, what I can do?"
tt0816692,"01:44:19,635","01:44:21,509",Let me go home.
tt0816692,"01:44:22,016","01:44:24,679",You're absolutely positive?
tt0816692,"01:44:24,792","01:44:29,297",His solution was correct. He's had it for years. -It's worthless?
tt0816692,"01:44:29,368","01:44:30,999",It's half the answer.
tt0816692,"01:44:31,585","01:44:35,132","Okay, how do you find the other half?"
tt0816692,"01:44:35,245","01:44:38,384","Out there, in a black hole. But stuck down on Earth?"
tt0816692,"01:44:38,493","01:44:40,007",Yeah?
tt0816692,"01:44:41,235","01:44:42,744",I'm not sure you can.
tt0816692,"01:44:43,689","01:44:47,589","God, they just pack up and leave."
tt0816692,"01:44:49,208","01:44:52,976",What're they hoping to find? -Survival.
tt0816692,"01:45:00,224","01:45:01,555",Damn it!
tt0816692,"01:45:04,623","01:45:08,469","Murph, don't, don't people have the right to know?"
tt0816692,"01:45:08,587","01:45:13,010","Panic won't help. We just have to keep working, same as ever."
tt0816692,"01:45:13,081","01:45:16,300","Yes, but isn't that exactly what Professor Brand was manipulating..."
tt0816692,"01:45:16,408","01:45:19,723",-Brand gave up on us. I'm still trying to solve this.
tt0816692,"01:45:20,381","01:45:24,245","So, do you have an idea?"
tt0816692,"01:45:25,431","01:45:26,906",A feeling.
tt0816692,"01:45:29,427","01:45:31,849",I told you about my ghost.
tt0816692,"01:45:33,404","01:45:37,952",My dad thought I called it a ghost because I was scared of it.
tt0816692,"01:45:42,020","01:45:43,491",But I was never scared of it.
tt0816692,"01:45:44,467","01:45:52,205","I called it a ghost because it felt....like a person,"
tt0816692,"01:45:53,969","01:45:56,814",that was trying to tell me something.
tt0816692,"01:45:58,980","01:46:02,184","If there is an answer here on Earth, it's back there,"
tt0816692,"01:46:02,256","01:46:06,502",somehow in that room. So I have to find it.
tt0816692,"01:46:09,890","01:46:11,978",We're running out of time.
tt0816692,"01:46:13,024","01:46:16,154",What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?
tt0816692,"01:46:16,261","01:46:19,922",They can stay CASE. I'll be sleeping most of the way anyway. -Hey Coop. -Yeah?
tt0816692,"01:46:20,030","01:46:23,474",I had a suggestion for your return journey. -What is that?
tt0816692,"01:46:23,583","01:46:25,459",Have one last crack at the black hole.
tt0816692,"01:46:26,767","01:46:30,269",I'm going home Rom. -Yeah I know.
tt0816692,"01:46:30,376","01:46:35,033",This isn't gonna cost you any time. It's a chance for the people on Earth.
tt0816692,"01:46:35,111","01:46:38,877",Talk to me. -Gargantua is an older spinning black hole.
tt0816692,"01:46:38,985","01:46:42,200",It is what we call a 'gentle' singularity. -Gentle?
tt0816692,"01:46:42,322","01:46:46,718",They're hardly gentle. But the tidal gravity is so quick that something...
tt0816692,"01:46:46,825","01:46:51,105","...crossing the horizon fast, might survive. A probe say."
tt0816692,"01:46:51,177","01:46:52,657",What happens after it crosses?
tt0816692,"01:46:52,736","01:46:55,618","After, the horizon, is a complete mystery."
tt0816692,"01:46:55,691","01:46:58,487","So, what's to say that there isn't some way that the probe can..."
tt0816692,"01:46:58,488","01:47:01,412",...glimpse the singularity and relay the quantum data?
tt0816692,"01:47:01,542","01:47:05,564",If he's equipped to transmit every form of energy that can pulse...
tt0816692,"01:47:05,653","01:47:10,508",Just when did this probe become a 'he' professor? -TARS is the obvious candidate.
tt0816692,"01:47:10,620","01:47:13,225",I've already told him what to look for.
tt0816692,"01:47:13,341","01:47:17,555","I'll need the old optical transmitter on KIPP, Cooper. -You would do this for us?"
tt0816692,"01:47:17,663","01:47:20,504","Before you get all teary, try to remember that as a robot..."
tt0816692,"01:47:20,578","01:47:24,190",...I have to do anything you say. -Your cue light's blinking.
tt0816692,"01:47:24,264","01:47:25,680",I'm not joking!
tt0816692,"01:47:27,304","01:47:32,029",I'm gonna need TARS to remove and adapt some components from KIPP.
tt0816692,"01:47:32,099","01:47:35,682","Well, I don't wanna disturb his archival functions. -I'll supervise."
tt0816692,"01:47:35,792","01:47:39,971","Alright. -Dr. Mann, we need to find 3 secure sites."
tt0816692,"01:47:40,051","01:47:42,314",One for Brand's lab and 2 for habitat.
tt0816692,"01:47:42,428","01:47:44,977","Once those modules have landed, you don't wanna move."
tt0816692,"01:47:45,077","01:47:47,234","Well I can take you to the probes sites, but I don't think this..."
tt0816692,"01:47:47,349","01:47:50,263",...these conditions are gonna hold. I think we should wait.
tt0816692,"01:47:50,374","01:47:53,256",CASE is headed back down with the rest of the distillery equipment.
tt0816692,"01:47:53,339","01:47:55,927",I would really like to secure those sites by nightfall.
tt0816692,"01:47:57,480","01:48:01,437","Well, these squalls do usually blow over."
tt0816692,"01:48:01,515","01:48:04,609",Okay then. -You're gonna have to take a long-range transmitter.
tt0816692,"01:48:04,723","01:48:06,499",Right. -Are you charged? -Yeah.
tt0816692,"01:48:06,581","01:48:07,995",Follow me.
tt0816692,"01:48:08,100","01:48:12,804","TARS, 72 hours yeah? -Roger that Cooper."
tt0816692,"01:48:18,979","01:48:22,033",Brand told me why you feel you've got to go back.
tt0816692,"01:48:22,847","01:48:27,625",But I'd be remiss if didn't at least mention that a mission...
tt0816692,"01:48:27,697","01:48:30,862",...such as ours could certainly do with an extra engineer.
tt0816692,"01:48:32,322","01:48:34,666",Oh you better slow down turbo.
tt0816692,"01:48:34,778","01:48:39,717","Safety first CASE, do not forget. -Safety first Cooper."
tt0816692,"01:48:39,795","01:48:44,256",I have to tell you Dr. Mann I'm honored to be a part of this.
tt0816692,"01:48:44,369","01:48:46,527",But once we set up base camp and...
tt0816692,"01:48:46,641","01:48:50,992","...secure those modules, my work is done here. I'm going home."
tt0816692,"01:48:53,290","01:48:55,955",
tt0816692,"01:48:09,829","01:48:11,556",We have attachments.
tt0816692,"01:49:00,632","01:49:04,918","But even without a family, I can, promise you that, that yearning..."
tt0816692,"01:49:05,024","01:49:07,505",...to be with other people is remarkable.
tt0816692,"01:49:07,538","01:49:13,581","That emotion is, at the foundation, of what makes us human."
tt0816692,"01:49:13,710","01:49:14,781",
tt0816692,"01:48:33,266","01:48:36,925",How long have you had that cough? -For a while.
tt0816692,"01:49:35,857","01:49:38,156",Mom let's me play in here.
tt0816692,"01:49:38,698","01:49:41,034",I don't touch your stuff.
tt0816692,"01:50:11,500","01:50:13,733",Just take this gently.
tt0816692,"01:50:19,161","01:50:22,619","You know why we couldn't just send machines on these missions, don't you Cooper?"
tt0816692,"01:50:22,733","01:50:27,709","A machine doesn't improvise well, because you can't programme the fear of death."
tt0816692,"01:50:27,781","01:50:32,345",Our survival instinct is our single greatest source of inspiration.
tt0816692,"01:50:32,455","01:50:34,447","Take you for example,"
tt0816692,"01:50:35,341","01:50:40,499","A father, with a survival instinct that extends to your kids."
tt0816692,"01:50:40,622","01:50:45,965","What does research tell us, is the last thing you're gonna see, before you die?"
tt0816692,"01:50:47,408","01:50:50,798",Your children. Their faces.
tt0816692,"01:50:50,875","01:50:54,976","At the moment of death, your mind is going to push you a little bit harder, to survive."
tt0816692,"01:50:55,057","01:50:58,642",For them.
tt0816692,"01:51:00,737","01:51:04,759","Hey, I bet you're Coop. Why don't you have a seat here for me."
tt0816692,"01:51:04,886","01:51:07,328",It's bad. They cannot stay here.
tt0816692,"01:51:07,687","01:51:09,462",OK? -Yes.
tt0816692,"01:51:17,230","01:51:21,881","TARS, what's taking so long? -Professor, I'm having trouble completing the boot-up."
tt0816692,"01:51:21,992","01:51:23,782",I don't understand?
tt0816692,"01:51:30,562","01:51:31,755",It's funny.
tt0816692,"01:51:33,727","01:51:38,790","When I left Earth, I thought I was prepared to die."
tt0816692,"01:51:39,764","01:51:47,044","The truth is, I never really, considered..."
tt0816692,"01:51:47,158","01:51:49,455",...the possibility that my planet wasn't the one.
tt0816692,"01:51:51,567","01:51:55,659",Nothing turns out the way it's supposed to be. -Let's go.
tt0816692,"01:52:01,313","01:52:03,891",Aaaaaaaaaaaah!!
tt0816692,"01:52:12,002","01:52:14,218",What is this? -What are you doing??
tt0816692,"01:52:14,330","01:52:17,683","I'm sorry, I can't let you leave with that ship."
tt0816692,"01:52:17,765","01:52:20,420",We're going to need it to complete the mission.
tt0816692,"01:52:20,530","01:52:25,527","Once the others, realize what this place isn't. We cannot survive here."
tt0816692,"01:52:25,604","01:52:27,993",I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
tt0816692,"01:52:37,981","01:52:39,299",They can't stay here anymore.
tt0816692,"01:52:39,373","01:52:42,995","You have to leave, right now. Hey buddy, let me make something abundantly clear..."
tt0816692,"01:52:43,071","01:52:45,837",You have a responsibility. -Shit.
tt0816692,"01:52:45,949","01:52:48,543","Coop, get her stuff, she's goin' home."
tt0816692,"01:52:48,653","01:52:50,723",-Dad didn't raise you to be this dumb Tom!
tt0816692,"01:52:50,802","01:52:53,099","Dad didn't raise me, grandpa did, and he's buried..."
tt0816692,"01:52:53,100","01:52:54,614",...out back with mom and Jesse.
tt0816692,"01:52:54,649","01:53:04,103",All the data?
tt0816692,"01:53:06,177","01:53:11,009",No. I tried to do my duty Cooper.
tt0816692,"01:53:11,119","01:53:15,932","But I knew, the day that I arrived here, this place had nothing..."
tt0816692,"01:53:16,008","01:53:20,289","...and I resisted the temptation, for years"
tt0816692,"01:53:20,364","01:53:28,320","But, I knew that, if I just pressed that button, then, somebody would come and save me."
tt0816692,"01:53:29,446","01:53:32,825",You fucking coward! -Yes.
tt0816692,"01:53:37,806","01:53:39,208",Yes.
tt0816692,"01:53:40,582","01:53:42,129",Yes.
tt0816692,"01:53:43,135","01:53:44,069",Yes.
tt0816692,"01:53:55,932","01:54:00,685","Listen, if you're not gonna go, let your family go. Just let,...save your family."
tt0816692,"01:54:00,717","01:54:05,574",And go to live underground? With you? Pray that daddy comes to save us?
tt0816692,"01:54:05,644","01:54:09,569",Dad's not coming back. He never was coming back. It's upto me!
tt0816692,"01:54:09,613","01:54:14,477",Are you going to save everybody? Because dad couldn't do it?. -DAD DIDN'T EVEN TRY!!
tt0816692,"01:54:14,597","01:54:16,293",Dad just abandoned us!!
tt0816692,"01:54:17,483","01:54:21,733",He left us here to die. -Nobody is going with you.
tt0816692,"01:54:25,618","01:54:27,822",You're gonna wait for your next kid to die?
tt0816692,"01:54:30,851","01:54:34,745","Get out, and don't come back!"
tt0816692,"01:54:39,510","01:54:41,352",Do what you want with those things.
tt0816692,"01:54:52,037","01:54:53,740",Stop it!
tt0816692,"01:54:55,510","01:54:58,061",No. NO!
tt0816692,"01:54:58,998","01:55:02,347",Dr. Mann there's a 50-50 chance that you're gonna kill yourselves.
tt0816692,"01:55:02,420","01:55:05,156",Those are the best odds I've had in years!
tt0816692,"01:55:25,209","01:55:30,041",Don't judge me Cooper. You were never tested like I was.
tt0816692,"01:55:30,486","01:55:32,414",Few men have been.
tt0816692,"01:55:40,704","01:55:42,400",You tried your best Murph.
tt0816692,"01:55:51,209","01:55:53,123",Do you feel it?
tt0816692,"01:55:54,133","01:55:56,431",The survival instinct.
tt0816692,"01:55:57,336","01:56:02,011","That's what drove me. It's what drives all of us, and it's what's gonna save us."
tt0816692,"01:56:02,087","01:56:05,843",Because I want to save all of us. For you Cooper.
tt0816692,"01:56:10,963","01:56:14,979","I'm sorry, I can't, I can't watch you go through this. I'm sorry."
tt0816692,"01:56:15,055","01:56:17,324","I thought I could, but I can't."
tt0816692,"01:56:18,589","01:56:21,054","I'm here, I'm here for you."
tt0816692,"01:56:21,161","01:56:24,953","Just listen to my voice Cooper, I'm right here."
tt0816692,"01:56:26,078","01:56:28,709",You're not alone.
tt0816692,"01:56:37,600","01:56:40,049",Do you see your children?
tt0816692,"01:56:42,537","01:56:46,661",It's okay. They are right there with you.
tt0816692,"01:56:50,522","01:56:53,802",Did Professor Brand tell you that poem before you left?
tt0816692,"01:56:53,912","01:56:55,606",Do you remember?
tt0816692,"01:56:56,833","01:57:01,300","'Do not go gentle, into that good night'"
tt0816692,"01:57:01,413","01:57:07,129","'Old age should burn, and rave at close of day.'"
tt0816692,"01:57:08,470","01:57:11,821","'Rage, rage against the dying of the light.'"
tt0816692,"01:57:36,233","01:57:39,127",Help! Help! -Cooper?
tt0816692,"01:57:46,045","01:57:48,864",CASE! -Brand.
tt0816692,"01:57:49,818","01:57:50,694",No air!
tt0816692,"01:57:52,726","01:57:56,174",Cooper. Cooper I'm coming. CASE! -I have a fix.
tt0816692,"01:57:56,256","01:57:58,590","Go, go, go!!"
tt0816692,"01:58:10,341","01:58:13,178","Cooper we're coming, hang in there, don't talk!"
tt0816692,"01:58:13,251","01:58:15,762",Breathe as little as possible. We're almost there!
tt0816692,"01:58:18,774","01:58:21,244","There is a security lockout sir, it requires..."
tt0816692,"01:58:21,326","01:58:24,017",...a person to access the functions.
tt0816692,"01:58:28,530","01:58:31,784",It's all yours sir.
tt0816692,"01:58:38,523","01:58:43,049",
tt0816692,"01:58:43,161","01:58:48,056",
tt0816692,"01:57:59,163","01:58:00,082",Cooper!!
tt0816692,"01:58:52,788","01:58:55,163",Come on!
tt0816692,"01:59:01,387","01:59:05,816",I see him! I see him! To the right. Bank right!
tt0816692,"01:59:23,848","01:59:27,107","Cooper! Cooper, I'm here."
tt0816692,"01:59:32,653","01:59:33,672",Take this!
tt0816692,"01:59:41,514","01:59:43,203",Joey bring the tankers!
tt0816692,"01:59:49,785","01:59:52,122",This data makes no sense.
tt0816692,"01:59:59,742","02:00:03,275",I'm sorry. -What?
tt0816692,"02:00:03,390","02:00:05,233","Mann, was lying!"
tt0816692,"02:00:11,822","02:00:14,890",
tt0816692,"01:59:26,014","01:59:28,927",Romilly!
tt0816692,"02:00:18,036","02:00:21,324","Romilly, do you read me? Romilly!!"
tt0816692,"02:00:21,433","02:00:23,207",STEP BACK PROFESSOR!! STEP BACK!!
tt0816692,"02:00:30,572","02:00:33,849",Romilly. -Romilly! Do you read me?!!
tt0816692,"02:00:36,203","02:00:37,821",Keep watch!
tt0816692,"02:00:38,973","02:00:42,598",Lois! -What happened to caution CASE?
tt0816692,"02:00:42,676","02:00:44,041",Safety first Cooper.
tt0816692,"02:00:44,119","02:00:47,860","Romilly, Romilly do you read me? This is Brand."
tt0816692,"02:00:50,627","02:00:54,680","Romilly! -Dr. Brand, Cooper, there's been an explosion."
tt0816692,"02:00:54,794","02:00:56,728",Dr. Mann's compound.
tt0816692,"02:01:24,800","02:01:26,562","TARS, TARS! 10 o'clock."
tt0816692,"02:01:33,045","02:01:35,006",Tell me when TARS is aboard.
tt0816692,"02:01:38,571","02:01:40,336",Romilly did not survive.
tt0816692,"02:01:41,563","02:01:45,448",I could not save him. -TARS is in. -I'll take it from here!
tt0816692,"02:01:45,559","02:01:47,945",D'you have a fix on the Ranger? -He is pushing into orbit.
tt0816692,"02:01:48,058","02:01:51,272","Ah, if he takes control of that ship we're dead."
tt0816692,"02:01:52,503","02:01:55,751",He'd maroon us? -He is marooning us!
tt0816692,"02:01:57,084","02:02:00,677",Get downstairs. Go wait by the car.
tt0816692,"02:02:07,397","02:02:11,277",Come on. Get in the back!
tt0816692,"02:02:11,346","02:02:12,358","Get in the back seat, now!!"
tt0816692,"02:02:17,537","02:02:22,222",Dr. Mann please respond! Dr. Mann please respond!!
tt0816692,"02:02:22,336","02:02:26,333",He doesn't know the Endurance's docking procedure. -But the autopilot does.
tt0816692,"02:02:26,446","02:02:30,220",Not since TARS disabled it! -Nice!
tt0816692,"02:02:30,293","02:02:33,104",What is your trust setting TARS? -Lower than yours apparently!
tt0816692,"02:02:37,955","02:02:41,024","Do not attempt docking, I repeat do not attempt docking."
tt0816692,"02:03:40,375","02:03:43,111",Auto docking sequence withheld.
tt0816692,"02:03:43,148","02:03:47,461",Override. -Unauthorized. -Override!
tt0816692,"02:03:47,537","02:03:49,665",Unauthorized.
tt0816692,"02:03:54,076","02:03:58,717","Do not attempt docking, I repeat Do Not! attempt docking! Please resp..."
tt0816692,"02:04:42,250","02:04:44,163",Moving slowly towards the Endurance.
tt0816692,"02:05:08,451","02:05:12,791",Imperfect contact. -Override! -Hatch locked.
tt0816692,"02:05:20,230","02:05:22,649",Has he locked on yet? -Imperfectly.
tt0816692,"02:05:24,683","02:05:26,368",Dr. Mann...
tt0816692,"02:05:47,024","02:05:49,978",Hatch lockout disengaged.
tt0816692,"02:05:58,899","02:06:02,785","Dr. Mann, do not, I repeat, do not open the hatch."

tt0816692,"02:06:33,072","02:06:36,087",What happens if he blows the airlock? -Nothing good.
tt0816692,"02:06:41,841","02:06:46,128","Okay, pull back, pull back. Retro thrusters full move back CASE! -Maximum. -Back!"
tt0816692,"02:06:46,381","02:06:49,151",CASE relay my message to the onboard computer...
tt0816692,"02:06:49,265","02:06:50,769",...and have it rebroadcast as emergency PA.
tt0816692,"02:06:50,804","02:06:56,687","Dr. Mann, do not open the air hatch."
tt0816692,"02:06:56,796","02:06:59,098","I repeat, do not... -Brand?"
tt0816692,"02:06:59,170","02:07:04,141",I don't know what he said to you? But I'm taking command of the Endurance.
tt0816692,"02:07:04,217","02:07:06,993",And then we're gonna talk about completing the mission.
tt0816692,"02:07:09,512","02:07:12,352","Dr. Mann, listen to me!"
tt0816692,"02:07:12,430","02:07:16,315","This is not about my life, or Cooper's life,"
tt0816692,"02:07:16,422","02:07:18,194",This is about all mankind.
tt0816692,"02:07:19,283","02:07:20,313",There is a moment...
tt0816692,"02:07:27,081","02:07:28,121",It is not...
tt0816692,"02:07:36,259","02:07:37,945","Oh, my God."
tt0816692,"02:07:55,853","02:08:01,597",Cooper there's no point in using your fuel... -Analyze the Endurance's spin.
tt0816692,"02:08:05,674","02:08:08,481",#NAME?
tt0816692,"02:08:11,353","02:08:14,530","Computer says rotation at 67, 68 rpm."
tt0816692,"02:08:14,603","02:08:18,747",Get ready to match our spin with the retro thrusters. -It's not possible.
tt0816692,"02:08:18,829","02:08:20,875","-No, it's necessary."
tt0816692,"02:08:31,953","02:08:34,651",The Endurance is entering the atmosphere.
tt0816692,"02:08:38,879","02:08:40,503",It does not have a heat shield.
tt0816692,"02:08:42,953","02:08:45,610","CASE, you ready? -Ready."
tt0816692,"02:08:53,979","02:08:56,798","Cooper, this is no time for caution."
tt0816692,"02:08:58,565","02:09:00,581","CASE, if I pass out, you take the stick."
tt0816692,"02:09:00,693","02:09:04,182","TARS, get ready to engage the docking mechanism."
tt0816692,"02:09:10,571","02:09:14,011",The Endurance is starting to heat. -20 feet out.
tt0816692,"02:09:14,093","02:09:17,940",I need three degrees starboard Cooper. -10 feet out.
tt0816692,"02:09:18,049","02:09:21,581","Cooper, we are, lined up!"
tt0816692,"02:09:21,697","02:09:23,093",Initiate spin!
tt0816692,"02:10:04,997","02:10:06,286",Hold on TARS!
tt0816692,"02:10:14,099","02:10:15,390",HOLD ON!
tt0816692,"02:10:25,858","02:10:29,323",We're locked Cooper. -EASING UP!
tt0816692,"02:10:36,567","02:10:38,665",Slowly.
tt0816692,"02:10:39,692","02:10:40,945",Slowly.
tt0816692,"02:10:46,219","02:10:48,160",Retro thrusters!
tt0816692,"02:10:55,663","02:10:57,948",Main engines on!
tt0816692,"02:11:03,061","02:11:06,545",We're getting out of orbit. Come on baby!
tt0816692,"02:11:14,121","02:11:15,747",Shutting engines.
tt0816692,"02:11:16,825","02:11:18,813",Okay we're out of orbit!
tt0816692,"02:11:26,379","02:11:29,616",Okay! And for our next trick!
tt0816692,"02:11:30,554","02:11:34,703",It better be good. We're headed into Gargantua's pull.
tt0816692,"02:11:35,670","02:11:39,213",Shit. CASE take the stick. -Roger that.
tt0816692,"02:12:28,345","02:12:31,253","Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua."
tt0816692,"02:12:31,401","02:12:33,924",Shall I use the engines?
tt0816692,"02:12:34,036","02:12:38,348","No, we gotta let her slide as far as we can!"
tt0816692,"02:12:47,609","02:12:50,433",Give it to me. -It's good news and bad news Cooper.
tt0816692,"02:12:50,543","02:12:54,433","Yeah, to hell with it TARS! Just give it to me straight."
tt0816692,"02:13:02,067","02:13:06,104","The back-up generator kicked in, so the system's stable. They're all good."
tt0816692,"02:13:07,274","02:13:11,491",Good! Okay. The navigational hub's been completely destroyed.
tt0816692,"02:13:11,599","02:13:14,216","We don't have enough life support to make it back to Earth,"
tt0816692,"02:13:14,291","02:13:18,229",but I think we can scratch over to Edmund's planet. -What about fuel?
tt0816692,"02:13:18,339","02:13:21,042",It's not enough. But I have a plan.
tt0816692,"02:13:21,081","02:13:24,595","We let, Gargantua, pull us down close..."
tt0816692,"02:13:24,598","02:13:27,729","to the horizon, and a powered slingshot..."
tt0816692,"02:13:27,848","02:13:30,503",...around launching us towards Edmund's planet. -Manually?
tt0816692,"02:13:30,615","02:13:34,282",That's what I'm here for. I'll take us just inside the critical orbit.
tt0816692,"02:13:34,357","02:13:35,865",What about the time slippage?
tt0816692,"02:13:35,979","02:13:39,472",Neither one of us have time to worry about relativity right now Dr. Brand.
tt0816692,"02:13:44,075","02:13:45,063",Sorry Cooper.
tt0816692,"02:13:47,300","02:13:50,330",Once we have gathered enough speed...
tt0816692,"02:13:50,402","02:13:53,454","...around Gargantua, we use Lander 1,"
tt0816692,"02:13:53,953","02:13:56,590",and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters...
tt0816692,"02:13:56,847","02:13:59,512",...to push us out of the black hole's gravity
tt0816692,"02:14:01,064","02:14:03,904","The Lander's linkages have been destroyed,"
tt0816692,"02:14:03,981","02:14:06,970",so we're going to have to control it manually.
tt0816692,"02:14:08,447","02:14:11,725","Once Lander 1 is spent, TARS will detach..."
tt0816692,"02:14:11,834","02:14:16,052",...and get sucked right into that black hole! -Why does TARS have to detach?
tt0816692,"02:14:16,163","02:14:20,651","We have to shed the weight, escape gravity. -Newton's third law."
tt0816692,"02:14:20,727","02:14:24,603",The only way humans have figured out of getting somewhere is to leave something behind.
tt0816692,"02:14:24,759","02:14:29,661","Cooper, you can't ask TARS to do this for us. -He's a robot..."
tt0816692,"02:14:29,776","02:14:33,871","...so you don't have to ask him to do anything. -Cooper, you asshole!"
tt0816692,"02:14:33,943","02:14:38,320","Sorry, you broke up a little bit there. -It's what we intended Dr. Brand."
tt0816692,"02:14:38,337","02:14:41,287","It's our only chance to save people on Earth,"
tt0816692,"02:14:41,364","02:14:46,126","if I can find a way to transmit the quantum data I'll find in there, maybe they'll make it."
tt0816692,"02:14:47,714","02:14:50,051",Let's just hope there is still someone there to save.
tt0816692,"02:15:18,609","02:15:20,460",Maximum velocity achieved.
tt0816692,"02:15:20,536","02:15:25,376",Prepare to fire speed thrusters.
tt0816692,"02:15:25,449","02:15:27,985",Ready? -Ready. -Ready.

tt0816692,"02:16:23,214","02:16:26,528",You're not too bad for someone pushing 120!
tt0816692,"02:16:41,641","02:16:44,815","Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark,"
tt0816692,"02:16:44,925","02:16:50,748","3, 2, 1..."

tt0816692,"02:16:54,779","02:16:59,347",Goodbye TARS! -Goodbye Dr. Brand. See you on the other side Coop.

tt0816692,"02:17:09,301","02:17:12,754",Okay CASE. Nice reckless flying!

tt0816692,"02:29:34,211","02:29:38,161","We're here to communicate, with the three dimensional world!"
tt0816692,"02:29:38,698","02:29:39,998",We are the bridge!
tt0816692,"02:29:47,177","02:29:50,272",I thought they chose me.
tt0816692,"02:29:52,900","02:29:56,908","But they didn't choose me, they chose her! -For what Cooper?"
tt0816692,"02:29:59,402","02:30:01,021",To save the world!
tt0816692,"02:30:05,058","02:30:09,185","All of this! In one, little girl's bedroom."
tt0816692,"02:30:09,297","02:30:11,719","Every moment, it's infinitely complex."
tt0816692,"02:30:11,826","02:30:14,819",They have access to infinite time and space...
tt0816692,"02:30:14,820","02:30:16,448",...but they're not bound by anything!
tt0816692,"02:30:16,577","02:30:21,327","They can't find, a specific place in time. They can't communicate."
tt0816692,"02:30:21,443","02:30:25,100",That's why I'm here. -I'm here to find a way...
tt0816692,"02:30:25,124","02:30:28,256","...to tell Murph, just like I found this moment. -How Cooper?"
tt0816692,"02:30:28,372","02:30:29,928","Love TARS, love!"
tt0816692,"02:30:30,040","02:30:33,634","It's just like Brand said, my connection with Murph, it is quantifiable."
tt0816692,"02:30:33,742","02:30:36,245",It is the key. -Why are we here?
tt0816692,"02:30:37,440","02:30:39,342",To find out how to tell.
tt0816692,"02:30:41,859","02:30:43,621",The watch!
tt0816692,"02:30:46,655","02:30:50,319",The watch!
tt0816692,"02:30:52,555","02:30:55,714",Encode the data in the movement of the second hand.
tt0816692,"02:30:59,139","02:31:03,135","TARS, translate the data into Morse and give it to me."
tt0816692,"02:31:03,208","02:31:06,565","Translating the data to Morse. Cooper, what if she never came back for it?"
tt0816692,"02:31:07,903","02:31:11,533",She will. She will.
tt0816692,"02:31:13,153","02:31:16,935",He's coming Murph!
tt0816692,"02:31:18,052","02:31:23,030","Okay, coming down! -How do you know?"
tt0816692,"02:31:26,489","02:31:28,255",Because I gave it to her!
tt0816692,"02:31:32,902","02:31:36,360","Roger Morse is dot dot dash dot,"
tt0816692,"02:31:39,206","02:31:44,093","Dot, dot, dash, dot,"
tt0816692,"02:31:44,168","02:31:46,405","dot, dash, dot, dot,"
tt0816692,"02:31:46,481","02:31:51,161","dot, dash, dot, dot,"
tt0816692,"02:31:51,236","02:31:54,183",
tt0816692,"02:31:22,073","02:31:25,995",It was him!!
tt0816692,"02:32:15,108","02:32:18,418",All the time!! I knew it!!!
tt0816692,"02:32:18,504","02:32:20,687",Dad saved us!!
tt0816692,"02:32:59,146","02:33:00,357",
tt0816692,"02:32:14,946","02:32:17,570",Eureka!!!
tt0816692,"02:33:09,022","02:33:10,930",It's traditional.
tt0816692,"02:33:15,042","02:33:16,805",Eureka!!!
tt0816692,"02:33:21,559","02:33:24,955",Did it work? -I think it might have.
tt0816692,"02:33:26,325","02:33:27,981",How do you know?
tt0816692,"02:33:28,061","02:33:31,505","Because, the bulk beings are closing the Tesseract."
tt0816692,"02:33:35,333","02:33:37,345",Don't you get it yet TARS?
tt0816692,"02:33:37,418","02:33:40,729",They're not beings.
tt0816692,"02:33:40,805","02:33:42,495",They're us!
tt0816692,"02:33:44,009","02:33:47,781","What I've been doing for Murph, they've been doing for me!"
tt0816692,"02:33:47,896","02:33:51,775","For all of us. -Cooper, people couldn't build this."
tt0816692,"02:33:51,851","02:33:56,388","No, no. Not yet. But one day."
tt0816692,"02:33:56,539","02:34:00,416",Not you and me. But people.
tt0816692,"02:34:00,488","02:34:06,138",A civilization that's evolved past the 4 dimensions that we know.
tt0816692,"02:34:11,693","02:34:12,805",What happens now?
tt0816692,"02:35:15,773","02:35:16,638",Mr. Cooper.
tt0816692,"02:35:21,281","02:35:25,069",Let's take it slow sir. Nice and easy Mr. Cooper.
tt0816692,"02:35:25,181","02:35:27,949",Remember you're no spring chicken anymore.
tt0816692,"02:35:28,059","02:35:30,502",Actually you are one hundred and twenty four years old.
tt0816692,"02:35:37,539","02:35:39,155",Take it slow sir.
tt0816692,"02:35:40,614","02:35:42,128","You were, um, extremely lucky."
tt0816692,"02:35:42,236","02:35:46,513",The Rangers found you with only minutes left in your oxygen supply.
tt0816692,"02:35:58,516","02:36:01,290",Where am I?
tt0816692,"02:36:03,204","02:36:04,787",Cooper station.
tt0816692,"02:36:06,050","02:36:07,713",Currently orbiting Saturn.
tt0816692,"02:36:08,947","02:36:11,690",Cooper station?
tt0816692,"02:36:14,448","02:36:16,887",What nice of you to name it after me!
tt0816692,"02:36:19,942","02:36:23,526","What? -Well, the station isn't named after you sir,"
tt0816692,"02:36:23,640","02:36:25,100","It's uh, it's named after your daughter."
tt0816692,"02:36:25,115","02:36:29,539",Although she's always maintained just how important you were. -Is she still alive?
tt0816692,"02:36:29,613","02:36:33,477",She'll be here in a couple of weeks.
tt0816692,"02:36:34,567","02:36:37,817",She is far too old to be transferred from another station...
tt0816692,"02:36:37,891","02:36:40,122",...but when she heard that you'd been found.
tt0816692,"02:36:40,229","02:36:43,756","Well this is, this is Murphy Cooper we're talking about!"
tt0816692,"02:36:43,867","02:36:45,741",Yes it is!
tt0816692,"02:36:48,222","02:36:50,244",We'll have you checked out of here in a couple of days.
tt0816692,"02:36:53,301","02:36:55,869",I'm sure you'll be excited to see what's in store.
tt0816692,"02:36:56,522","02:37:01,396","I actually uhh, did a paper on you, in high school,"
tt0816692,"02:37:01,504","02:37:03,132",I know all about your life back on Earth.
tt0816692,"02:37:04,931","02:37:07,632","Oh yeah, right."
tt0816692,"02:37:09,004","02:37:15,365","Sir, if you could follow me? You've got a really good situation."
tt0816692,"02:37:19,147","02:37:22,537","So um, when I made my suggestion to Ms. Cooper,"
tt0816692,"02:37:23,873","02:37:26,817",I was delighted to hear that she thought it was perfect.
tt0816692,"02:37:33,438","02:37:37,200","Well of course, I didn't speak to her in person."
tt0816692,"02:37:41,429","02:37:46,313",My dad was a farmer. Like everybody else back then.
tt0816692,"02:37:46,422","02:37:49,641","Anyway, there just wasn't enough food."
tt0816692,"02:37:49,753","02:37:55,727",We had strips of sheet to cover our nose and mouth.
tt0816692,"02:37:56,021","02:37:58,284",So we wouldn't breathe so much of it.
tt0816692,"02:37:58,358","02:38:01,302",
tt0816692,"02:37:12,412","02:37:16,944",
tt0816692,"02:37:17,025","02:37:19,677","She did confirm, just how much you loved farming."
tt0816692,"02:38:08,758","02:38:11,141",She did? Did she?
tt0816692,"02:38:11,215","02:38:14,529","Well, home sweet home!"
tt0816692,"02:38:14,601","02:38:18,229",Everything is in its place and faithfully reproduced.
tt0816692,"02:38:18,310","02:38:19,695",Yes.
tt0816692,"02:38:24,244","02:38:29,517","Hey, is this? -Oh yeah, the machine we found out near Saturn with you."
tt0816692,"02:38:29,630","02:38:32,994","It's power source is shot, but we can get another one if you want."
tt0816692,"02:38:33,103","02:38:34,863","Yes, please!"

tt0816692,"02:38:52,592","02:38:57,272",Humor: 75%
tt0816692,"02:38:57,382","02:38:58,935",Confirmed.

tt0816692,"02:39:03,158","02:39:04,740",Let's make that 60%.
tt0816692,"02:39:06,514","02:39:09,317",60% confirmed.
tt0816692,"02:39:09,390","02:39:13,138",Knock Knock. -You want 55?
tt0816692,"02:39:17,503","02:39:19,503",Is this really what it was like?
tt0816692,"02:39:21,845","02:39:24,549",It was never this clean slick.
tt0816692,"02:39:29,270","02:39:33,793","I don't care much for this, pretending we are back where we started."
tt0816692,"02:39:34,622","02:39:36,853",I want to know where we are?
tt0816692,"02:39:37,978","02:39:40,309",Where are we going?
tt0816692,"02:39:45,183","02:39:47,645",Mr Cooper. -Yes? -The family is all in there.
tt0816692,"02:39:47,802","02:39:49,433",Family?
tt0816692,"02:39:49,544","02:39:53,392","Yeah, they all came out to see her. She's been in cryo sleep for almost 2 years."
tt0816692,"02:40:26,034","02:40:28,800",You told them I liked farming?
tt0816692,"02:40:34,241","02:40:35,393",It was me Murph!
tt0816692,"02:40:37,839","02:40:40,250",I was your ghost!
tt0816692,"02:40:41,300","02:40:42,774",I know.
tt0816692,"02:40:44,901","02:40:50,545","People didn't believe me, they thought I was doing it all myself. But..."
tt0816692,"02:40:53,721","02:40:56,134",...I knew who it was.
tt0816692,"02:41:00,277","02:41:02,368",Nobody believed me.
tt0816692,"02:41:02,487","02:41:05,431",But I knew you'd come back.
tt0816692,"02:41:07,234","02:41:08,849",How?
tt0816692,"02:41:10,190","02:41:14,150",Because my dad promised me!
tt0816692,"02:41:20,540","02:41:24,642",I'm here now Murph. I'm here!
tt0816692,"02:41:26,450","02:41:33,894",No. No parent should have to watch their own child die.
tt0816692,"02:41:36,028","02:41:40,166",I have my kids here for me now.
tt0816692,"02:41:42,436","02:41:44,505",You go!
tt0816692,"02:41:47,058","02:41:47,994",Where?
tt0816692,"02:41:51,352","02:41:53,479",Brand.
tt0816692,"02:42:02,505","02:42:05,299","She's, out there."
tt0816692,"02:42:09,863","02:42:12,829",Setting up camp.
tt0816692,"02:42:39,381","02:42:44,814","Alone, in a strange galaxy."
tt0816692,"02:42:55,554","02:42:59,023","Maybe right now she's, settling in..."
tt0816692,"02:42:59,058","02:43:01,378",...for the long nap.
tt0816692,"02:43:17,324","02:43:21,753",By the light of our new sun.
tt0816692,"02:43:36,669","02:43:39,369",In our new home.
tt0816692,"02:43:42,369","02:43:46,369",
tt0110912,"00:00:28,340","00:00:32,428",Forget it. It's too risky. I'm through doing that shit.
tt0110912,"00:00:32,508","00:00:35,966",You always say that. The same thing every time.
tt0110912,"00:00:36,038","00:00:37,977","""l'm through, never again, too dangerous."""
tt0110912,"00:00:38,048","00:00:40,537",I know that's what I always say. I'm always right too.
tt0110912,"00:00:40,617","00:00:44,015",#NAME?
tt0110912,"00:00:44,087","00:00:46,176",The days of me remembering have just begun.
tt0110912,"00:00:46,248","00:00:48,417","You know, when you go on like this, what you sound like ?"
tt0110912,"00:00:48,488","00:00:51,516",- I sound like a sensible fuckin' man. - You sound like a duck.
tt0110912,"00:00:51,588","00:00:55,046","- Quack, quack, quack. - Take heart, 'cause you're never gonna have to hear it again."
tt0110912,"00:00:55,127","00:00:58,615","Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna have to hear me quack."
tt0110912,"00:00:58,696","00:01:03,425",- After tonight ? - Correct. I got all tonight to quack.
tt0110912,"00:01:03,506","00:01:06,335","- Can I get anyone more coffee ? - Oh, yes !"
tt0110912,"00:01:08,136","00:01:10,695",- Thank you. - You're welcome.
tt0110912,"00:01:10,776","00:01:13,864","I mean, the way it is now,"
tt0110912,"00:01:13,946","00:01:16,745",you're takin' the same risk as when you rob a bank.
tt0110912,"00:01:16,815","00:01:18,874",Takin' more of a risk. Banks are easier.
tt0110912,"00:01:18,945","00:01:21,973",Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you in any way during a robbery.
tt0110912,"00:01:22,056","00:01:26,284",They're insured. Why should they give a fuck ? I don't even need a gun in a Federal bank.
tt0110912,"00:01:26,356","00:01:29,814","Heard about this one bloke, he walks into a bank with a portable phone."
tt0110912,"00:01:29,895","00:01:32,864","He gives the phone to a teller. The bloke on the other end says,"
tt0110912,"00:01:32,925","00:01:36,493","""We got this guy's little girl. If you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill her."""
tt0110912,"00:01:36,565","00:01:39,364",- Did it work ? - Fuckin' right it worked. That's what I'm talkin' about.
tt0110912,"00:01:39,434","00:01:45,273","Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone. Not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone."
tt0110912,"00:01:45,345","00:01:49,974",- Cleans the place out. They don't lift a fuckin' finger. - Did they hurt the little girl ?
tt0110912,"00:01:50,044","00:01:53,742",There probably never was a little girl. The point of the story isn't a little girl.
tt0110912,"00:01:53,814","00:01:56,802",The point of the story is they robbed a bank with a telephone.
tt0110912,"00:01:56,883","00:01:59,852",- You want to rob banks ? - I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.
tt0110912,"00:01:59,924","00:02:02,353","I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be easier than what we've been doing."
tt0110912,"00:02:02,424","00:02:06,582","-No more liquor stores ? -What've we been talkin' about ? Yeah, no more liquor stores."
tt0110912,"00:02:06,663","00:02:09,632","Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be. There's too many foreigners own liquor stores."
tt0110912,"00:02:09,692","00:02:11,631","Vietnamese, Koreans, don't even speak fuckin' English."
tt0110912,"00:02:11,703","00:02:14,062","You tell 'em empty out the register, they don't know what you're talkin' about."
tt0110912,"00:02:14,132","00:02:16,071",They make it too personal.

tt0110912,"00:09:32,138","00:09:35,236","- and on this invention they show shows, right ? - Yeah."
tt0110912,"00:09:35,308","00:09:39,716",The way they pick TV shows is they make one show. That show's called a pilot.
tt0110912,"00:09:39,777","00:09:42,716",Then they show that one show to the people who pick shows...
tt0110912,"00:09:42,788","00:09:45,717","and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they wanna make more shows."
tt0110912,"00:09:45,787","00:09:50,316","Some get chosen and become television programs. Some don't, become nothin'."
tt0110912,"00:09:50,387","00:09:53,585",She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.

tt0110912,"00:10:03,867","00:10:06,706","I mean, he got a weight problem. What's a nigger gonna do ? He's Samoan."
tt0110912,"00:10:06,776","00:10:11,204",- I think I know who you mean. What about him ? - Marsellus fucked him up good.
tt0110912,"00:10:11,275","00:10:15,503",Word 'round the campfire is it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.
tt0110912,"00:10:23,655","00:10:27,683","- So what he'd do ? Fuck her ? - No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad."
tt0110912,"00:10:27,755","00:10:31,453","- Well, then what then ? - He gave her a foot massage."

tt0110912,"00:10:38,174","00:10:40,103",Then what'd Marsellus do ?
tt0110912,"00:10:40,175","00:10:43,333",Sent a couple cats over to his place. They took him out on his patio.
tt0110912,"00:10:43,404","00:10:47,342",Threw his ass over the balcony. Nigger fell four stories.
tt0110912,"00:10:47,413","00:10:51,471","He had a little garden down at the bottom enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse."
tt0110912,"00:10:51,553","00:10:53,812",Nigger fell through that.
tt0110912,"00:10:53,884","00:10:56,823","Since then, he kind of developed a speech impediment."
tt0110912,"00:10:58,294","00:11:01,023",- That's a damn shame. - Hmm.
tt0110912,"00:11:05,732","00:11:09,530","- But still, you play with matches, you get burned. - What do you mean ?"

tt0110912,"00:11:13,832","00:11:16,301",You don't think he overreacted ?
tt0110912,"00:11:16,373","00:11:21,242","Antwan didn't expect Marsellus to react the way he did, but he had to expect a reaction."
tt0110912,"00:11:21,312","00:11:25,470",It was a foot massage. A foot massage is nothin'. I give my mother a foot massage.
tt0110912,"00:11:25,551","00:11:29,069",It's laying your hands in a familiar way on Marsellus's new wife.
tt0110912,"00:11:29,152","00:11:34,051","I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy out ? No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark."

tt0110912,"00:38:13,691","00:38:16,789",Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam.
tt0110912,"00:38:16,862","00:38:19,990",- Sure did. - How long were you there ?
tt0110912,"00:38:20,072","00:38:22,591",Just over three years.
tt0110912,"00:38:25,141","00:38:27,970",I go there about once a year to chill out for a month.
tt0110912,"00:38:28,041","00:38:31,769",No kiddin' ? I didn't know that.
tt0110912,"00:38:31,840","00:38:34,779",Why would you ?
tt0110912,"00:38:39,450","00:38:41,389",I heard you did a pilot.
tt0110912,"00:38:42,660","00:38:46,348",- That was my 15 minutes. - What was it ?
tt0110912,"00:38:46,430","00:38:51,129",It was a show about a team of female secret agents called Fox Force Five.
tt0110912,"00:38:51,200","00:38:53,929",- What ? - Fox Force Five.
tt0110912,"00:38:53,999","00:38:56,258","Fox, as in were a bunch of foxy chicks."
tt0110912,"00:38:56,339","00:38:58,798","Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with."
tt0110912,"00:38:58,869","00:39:01,638","And five, as in there's one-two-three-four-five of us."
tt0110912,"00:39:01,709","00:39:05,397","There was a blond one, Sommerset O'Neal. She was the leader."
tt0110912,"00:39:05,478","00:39:08,606",The Japanese fox was a kung fu master.
tt0110912,"00:39:08,679","00:39:12,737",The black girl was a demolition expert.
tt0110912,"00:39:12,819","00:39:15,688",French fox's speciality was sex.
tt0110912,"00:39:15,758","00:39:20,116",- What was your speciality ? - Knives.
tt0110912,"00:39:20,257","00:39:22,226","The character I played, Raven McCoy,"
tt0110912,"00:39:22,288","00:39:26,156",her background was she grew up raised by circus performers.
tt0110912,"00:39:26,228","00:39:30,496","According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife."
tt0110912,"00:39:30,568","00:39:33,327",And she knew a zillion old jokes.
tt0110912,"00:39:33,397","00:39:37,525","Her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her."
tt0110912,"00:39:37,606","00:39:40,904","And if we would have got picked up, they would've worked in a gimmick..."
tt0110912,"00:39:40,976","00:39:44,844",where every show I would've told another joke.
tt0110912,"00:39:46,047","00:39:48,806",You know any of them old jokes ?
tt0110912,"00:39:48,887","00:39:52,615","Well, I only got the chance to say one 'cause we only did one show."
tt0110912,"00:39:52,686","00:39:55,245",- Tell me. - It's corny.
tt0110912,"00:39:56,155","00:39:58,244",Don't be that way. Tell me.
tt0110912,"00:39:58,325","00:40:02,023","- No, you wouldn't like it, and I'd be embarrassed. - You'd be embarr--"
tt0110912,"00:40:02,096","00:40:06,034","You told 50 million people, and you can't tell me ?"
tt0110912,"00:40:06,096","00:40:09,964","- I promise I won't laugh. - That's what I'm afraid of, Vince."
tt0110912,"00:40:10,035","00:40:12,364",That's not what I meant. You know it.
tt0110912,"00:40:12,435","00:40:15,873",Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you 'cause it's been built up too much.
tt0110912,"00:40:15,945","00:40:18,534",What a gyp.
tt0110912,"00:40:19,715","00:40:22,074",Martin and Lewis.
tt0110912,"00:40:25,154","00:40:27,553",Vanilla Coke.
tt0110912,"00:40:31,893","00:40:35,221",Mmm. Yummy.
tt0110912,"00:40:35,293","00:40:38,262",You think I could have a sip of that ?
tt0110912,"00:40:39,794","00:40:41,963",Be my guest.
tt0110912,"00:40:42,034","00:40:46,062",I gotta know what a five-dollar shake tastes like.
tt0110912,"00:40:46,133","00:40:49,591","- You can use my straw. I don't have cooties. - Yeah, but maybe I do."
tt0110912,"00:40:49,672","00:40:52,541",Cooties I can handle.
tt0110912,"00:40:52,612","00:40:54,581",All right.
tt0110912,"00:41:01,652","00:41:04,451","Goddamn, that's a pretty fuckin' good milkshake !"
tt0110912,"00:41:04,522","00:41:08,580","-Told ya. -I don't know if it was worth $5, but it's pretty fuckin' good."
tt0110912,"00:41:43,519","00:41:47,047",- Don't you hate that ? - Hate what ?
tt0110912,"00:41:47,129","00:41:49,458",Uncomfortable silences.
tt0110912,"00:41:51,469","00:41:55,988",Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable ?
tt0110912,"00:41:56,069","00:42:00,007",I don't know. That's a good question.
tt0110912,"00:42:00,069","00:42:04,808",That's when you know you found somebody really special.
tt0110912,"00:42:04,878","00:42:09,577",When you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably share silence.
tt0110912,"00:42:09,648","00:42:13,746","Well, I don't think we're quite there yet, but don't feel bad. We just met each other."
tt0110912,"00:42:15,258","00:42:18,376",I'll tell you what.
tt0110912,"00:42:18,457","00:42:21,715",I'm gonna go to the bathroom and powder my nose.
tt0110912,"00:42:21,797","00:42:24,985",You sit here... and think of something to say.
tt0110912,"00:42:26,228","00:42:28,167",I'll do that.
tt0110912,"00:42:30,497","00:42:32,436",Okay.
tt0110912,"00:42:57,695","00:42:59,884",I said goddamn !
tt0110912,"00:42:59,966","00:43:03,124",Goddamn ! Goddamn.
tt0110912,"00:43:05,735","00:43:08,324",I need some hair spray.
tt0110912,"00:43:14,175","00:43:16,164",Mmmm.
tt0110912,"00:43:16,244","00:43:20,572",Don't you just love it when you come back from the bathroom to find your food waiting for you ?
tt0110912,"00:43:20,644","00:43:23,043",We're lucky we got anything at all.
tt0110912,"00:43:23,115","00:43:26,243",I don't think Buddy Holly's much of a waiter.
tt0110912,"00:43:26,324","00:43:29,452",Maybe we should've sat in Marilyn Monroe's section.
tt0110912,"00:43:29,523","00:43:32,581","- Which one ? There's two Monroes. - No, there's not."
tt0110912,"00:43:32,663","00:43:34,992",That is Marilyn Monroe.
tt0110912,"00:43:35,063","00:43:37,792",That is Mamie Van Doren.
tt0110912,"00:43:37,864","00:43:42,803","I don't see Jayne Mansfield, so she must have the night off."
tt0110912,"00:43:42,873","00:43:46,301",#NAME?
tt0110912,"00:43:46,373","00:43:50,741","- So did you think of somethin' to say ? - Actually, I did."
tt0110912,"00:43:52,382","00:43:54,341",However...
tt0110912,"00:43:56,053","00:43:59,071","you seem like a really nice person, and l--"
tt0110912,"00:43:59,152","00:44:01,981",- I don't want to offend you. - Oooh.
tt0110912,"00:44:02,052","00:44:07,251","This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless, boring, gettin'-to-know-you chitchat."
tt0110912,"00:44:07,322","00:44:10,320",This sounds like you actually have somethin' to say.
tt0110912,"00:44:10,391","00:44:13,230","Well, well, I do. I do."
tt0110912,"00:44:13,302","00:44:17,360",#NAME?
tt0110912,"00:44:17,441","00:44:21,669",You can't promise somethin' like that. I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.
tt0110912,"00:44:21,741","00:44:26,610","You can ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to get offended."
tt0110912,"00:44:26,680","00:44:29,039","Then, through no fault of my own, I would have broken my promise."
tt0110912,"00:44:29,111","00:44:31,810",- Let's just forget it. - That's an impossibility.
tt0110912,"00:44:31,880","00:44:35,938",Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.
tt0110912,"00:44:36,020","00:44:38,219","- Is that a fact ? - And besides,"
tt0110912,"00:44:38,290","00:44:43,319","- isn't it more, uh, exciting when you don't have permission ? - All right, all right."
tt0110912,"00:44:43,390","00:44:46,189","Well, here goes."
tt0110912,"00:44:46,259","00:44:49,287",What did you think about what happened to Antwan ?
tt0110912,"00:44:49,370","00:44:52,798",- Who's Antwan ? - Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.
tt0110912,"00:44:52,869","00:44:56,097",#NAME?
tt0110912,"00:44:56,169","00:45:00,868","Well, that is one way to say it. Another way to say it would be that he was thrown out."
tt0110912,"00:45:00,949","00:45:04,107",Another way would be he was thrown out by Marsellus.
tt0110912,"00:45:04,178","00:45:09,307",Yet even another way is to say he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you.
tt0110912,"00:45:09,389","00:45:11,818",- Is that a fact ? - No.
tt0110912,"00:45:11,888","00:45:15,016","No, it's not a fact. It's just what I heard. That's just what I heard."
tt0110912,"00:45:15,088","00:45:17,987",- Who told you ? - They.
tt0110912,"00:45:18,058","00:45:20,527","""They"" talk a lot, don't they ?"
tt0110912,"00:45:22,698","00:45:25,357",They certainly do. They certainly do.
tt0110912,"00:45:25,437","00:45:29,835","- Don't be shy, Vincent. What else did ""they"" say ? - I'm-- I'm not shy."
tt0110912,"00:45:29,907","00:45:32,426","- Um-- - Did it involve the ""F"" word ?"
tt0110912,"00:45:32,507","00:45:36,495","No, no, no, no, no. They just said that Antwan had given you a foot massage."
tt0110912,"00:45:38,046","00:45:40,675",- And ? - And-- And nothin'.
tt0110912,"00:45:40,747","00:45:43,616",That's it.
tt0110912,"00:45:43,686","00:45:45,745",You heard Marsellus...
tt0110912,"00:45:45,817","00:45:50,185",threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a fourth-story window for giving me a foot massage ?
tt0110912,"00:45:50,256","00:45:52,195",- Mm-hmm. - And you believe that ?
tt0110912,"00:45:52,255","00:45:56,784","Well, at the time I was told it sounded reasonable."
tt0110912,"00:45:56,865","00:45:59,953",Marsellus throwing Tony out of a fourth-story window...
tt0110912,"00:46:00,036","00:46:03,094",for massaging my feet seemed reasonable ?
tt0110912,"00:46:03,166","00:46:06,624","No, it seemed excessive, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen."
tt0110912,"00:46:06,705","00:46:09,364",I understand that Marsellus is very protective of you.
tt0110912,"00:46:09,445","00:46:14,074",A husband being protective of his wife is one thing.
tt0110912,"00:46:14,144","00:46:17,872",A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.
tt0110912,"00:46:17,955","00:46:20,544",But did it happen ?
tt0110912,"00:46:20,615","00:46:26,454",Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand when he shook it... at my wedding.
tt0110912,"00:46:26,524","00:46:28,923",Really ?
tt0110912,"00:46:28,993","00:46:32,321","Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus threw Tony out that window..."
tt0110912,"00:46:32,393","00:46:34,332",except Marsellus and Tony.
tt0110912,"00:46:34,404","00:46:38,392","When you little scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle."
tt0110912,"00:46:38,534","00:46:42,402",Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment you've all been waiting for.

tt0110912,"00:47:07,931","00:47:12,660","No, no, no, no, no. I do believe Marsellus, my husband, your boss,"
tt0110912,"00:47:12,731","00:47:16,169",told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted.
tt0110912,"00:47:16,241","00:47:19,929",Now I wanna dance; I wanna win; I want that trophy.

tt0110912,"00:47:42,199","00:47:45,637","All right, let's see what you can do. Take it away !"
tt0110912,"00:47:45,710","00:47:48,639",-  Go for it. -  Come on !
tt0110912,"00:48:06,928","00:48:10,886",It was a teenage wedding and the old folks wished them well
tt0110912,"00:48:12,898","00:48:16,856",You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle
tt0110912,"00:48:18,937","00:48:23,035",And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell
tt0110912,"00:48:25,007","00:48:29,305",C'est la vie say the old folks It goes to show you never can tell
tt0110912,"00:48:31,187","00:48:35,345",They furnished off an apartment with a two-room Roebucks sale
tt0110912,"00:48:37,256","00:48:41,524",The 'coolerador was crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale
tt0110912,"00:48:43,397","00:48:47,295",But when Pierre found work the little money comin' worked out well
tt0110912,"00:48:49,396","00:48:53,664",C'est la vie say the old folks It goes to show you never can tell

tt0110912,"00:50:33,070","00:50:36,428",I don't know what you call that.
tt0110912,"00:50:36,500","00:50:39,129",- Drinks ! Music !

tt0110912,"00:59:59,019","01:00:02,447",But it's gotta be hard enough to get through her breastplate into her heart.

tt0110912,"01:01:54,652","01:01:56,711",I'd be in as much trouble as you.
tt0110912,"01:01:56,781","01:01:59,280",I seriously doubt that.

tt0110912,"01:04:25,694","01:04:28,722",We were in that Hanoi pit of hell together...
tt0110912,"01:04:28,794","01:04:31,263",over five years.
tt0110912,"01:04:31,333","01:04:33,262",Hopefully...
tt0110912,"01:04:33,333","01:04:36,272","you'll never have to experience this yourself,"
tt0110912,"01:04:36,332","01:04:39,770",but when two men are in a situation like me and your dad were...

tt0110912,"01:04:42,713","01:04:47,011",you take on certain responsibilities of the other.
tt0110912,"01:04:47,083","01:04:49,012",If it'd been me who'd--
tt0110912,"01:04:50,352","01:04:52,281","not made it,"
tt0110912,"01:04:52,352","01:04:56,620",Major Coolidge'd be talking right now to my son Jim.

tt0110912,"01:05:05,232","01:05:07,161",I got something for ya.
tt0110912,"01:05:13,671","01:05:15,730",This watch I got here...
tt0110912,"01:05:15,810","01:05:20,609",was first purchased by your great-grandfather during the first World War.
tt0110912,"01:05:20,681","01:05:25,340","It was bought in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee."
tt0110912,"01:05:25,420","01:05:28,978",Made by the first company to ever make wristwatches.
tt0110912,"01:05:29,050","01:05:31,989","Up 'til then, people just carried pocket watches."
tt0110912,"01:05:32,060","01:05:35,218",It was bought by Private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...
tt0110912,"01:05:35,289","01:05:38,228",on the day he set sail for Paris.
tt0110912,"01:05:38,300","01:05:40,729","This was your great-grandfather's war watch,"
tt0110912,"01:05:40,800","01:05:44,158","and he wore it every day he was in that war, and..."
tt0110912,"01:05:44,229","01:05:47,797","when he'd done his duty, he went home to your great-grandmother,"
tt0110912,"01:05:47,868","01:05:52,306","took the watch off, put it in an old coffee can, and in that can it stayed..."
tt0110912,"01:05:52,378","01:05:56,806","until your granddad, Dane Coolidge, was called upon by his country..."
tt0110912,"01:05:56,878","01:06:00,606",to go overseas and fight the Germans once again.
tt0110912,"01:06:00,678","01:06:04,136",This time they called it World War ll.
tt0110912,"01:06:04,218","01:06:09,217",Your great-grandfather gave this watch to your granddad for good luck.
tt0110912,"01:06:09,287","01:06:12,285","Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's."
tt0110912,"01:06:12,358","01:06:15,297","Dane was a Marine, and he was killed..."
tt0110912,"01:06:15,367","01:06:19,385",along with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake lsland.
tt0110912,"01:06:19,467","01:06:22,396",Your granddad was facing death.
tt0110912,"01:06:22,467","01:06:24,406",He knew it.
tt0110912,"01:06:24,466","01:06:28,404","None of those boys ever had any illusions about leaving that island alive,"
tt0110912,"01:06:28,476","01:06:31,674","so three days before the Japanese took the island,"
tt0110912,"01:06:31,747","01:06:36,976","your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport, name of Winocki--"
tt0110912,"01:06:37,046","01:06:39,985",a man he'd never met before in his life--
tt0110912,"01:06:40,056","01:06:43,025","to deliver to his infant son,"
tt0110912,"01:06:43,086","01:06:47,685","who he'd never seen in the flesh, his gold watch."
tt0110912,"01:06:47,756","01:06:52,094","Three days later, your granddad was dead, but Winocki kept his word."
tt0110912,"01:06:52,166","01:06:56,434","After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother,"
tt0110912,"01:06:56,505","01:07:00,733",delivering to your infant father his dad's gold watch.
tt0110912,"01:07:00,805","01:07:02,744",This watch.
tt0110912,"01:07:08,614","01:07:14,053",This watch was on your daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi.
tt0110912,"01:07:14,114","01:07:17,552","He was captured, put in a Vietnamese prison camp."
tt0110912,"01:07:17,623","01:07:21,681","He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch,"
tt0110912,"01:07:21,763","01:07:25,281","it'd be confiscated, taken away."
tt0110912,"01:07:25,364","01:07:29,062","The way your dad looked at it, this watch was your birthright."
tt0110912,"01:07:29,133","01:07:33,071","He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright,"
tt0110912,"01:07:33,133","01:07:37,071",so he hid it in one place he knew he could hide something-- his ass.
tt0110912,"01:07:37,143","01:07:40,571",Five long years he wore this watch up his ass.
tt0110912,"01:07:40,643","01:07:44,841",Then he died of dysentery-- He give me the watch.
tt0110912,"01:07:44,912","01:07:48,780",I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass two years.
tt0110912,"01:07:48,852","01:07:50,781",Then...
tt0110912,"01:07:50,852","01:07:54,910","after seven years, I was sent home to my family and..."
tt0110912,"01:07:54,992","01:07:56,921",now...
tt0110912,"01:07:59,362","01:08:02,291","Iittle man, I give the watch to you."
tt0110912,"01:08:25,150","01:08:27,089","It's time, Butch."

tt0110912,"01:08:55,618","01:08:58,047","hands down, the most brutal fight this city's ever seen."
tt0110912,"01:08:58,118","01:09:01,706",Coolidge was out of there faster than I've ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring.
tt0110912,"01:09:01,788","01:09:04,717",- Do you think he knew Wilson was dead ? - My guess would be yes.
tt0110912,"01:09:04,787","01:09:08,225",I could see the frenzy in his eyes give way to the realization of what he was doing.
tt0110912,"01:09:08,297","01:09:11,725",- I think any man would've left the ring that fast. - Do you feel this tragedy...
tt0110912,"01:09:11,798","01:09:13,727",is gonna affect the world of boxing ?
tt0110912,"01:09:13,797","01:09:17,735",A tragedy like this can't help but shake the world of boxing to its very foundations.

tt0110912,"01:09:58,975","01:10:01,904","- Marsellus. - No, it wasn't. I didn't do it."
tt0110912,"01:10:01,974","01:10:03,913",I didn't do it.
tt0110912,"01:10:03,975","01:10:06,474",- How you doing ? - Great.

tt0110912,"01:10:28,733","01:10:31,672",I'm prepared to scour the Earth for that motherfucker.

tt0110912,"01:13:18,593","01:13:23,031",Didn't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead.

tt0110912,"01:13:31,442","01:13:34,880",I don't feel the least bit bad about it.
tt0110912,"01:13:45,852","01:13:48,291",What the fuck'd I tell ya ? Huh ?
tt0110912,"01:13:48,362","01:13:52,290","As soon as the word got out the fix was in, man, the odds went through the roof."
tt0110912,"01:13:52,361","01:13:54,560",I know. I know. Unbelievable.
tt0110912,"01:13:54,631","01:13:58,069","Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was a better boxer, he'd still be alive."
tt0110912,"01:13:58,132","01:14:00,071","If he never laced up his gloves,"
tt0110912,"01:14:00,132","01:14:02,571","which he never shoulda done in the first fuckin' place, he'd still be alive."
tt0110912,"01:14:04,641","01:14:08,229","Yeah, well, who gives a fuck ? It's over now."
tt0110912,"01:14:08,310","01:14:11,239","Yeah, well, enough about the poor, unfortunate Mr. Floyd."
tt0110912,"01:14:11,310","01:14:15,008",Let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr. Butch.
tt0110912,"01:14:15,081","01:14:18,020",How many bookies did you lay it around on ?
tt0110912,"01:14:18,091","01:14:20,520",All eight ? How long to collect ?
tt0110912,"01:14:22,160","01:14:25,089","So you'll have it all by tomorrow night ? No, I understand."
tt0110912,"01:14:25,159","01:14:28,317","A few stragglers aside. Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news."
tt0110912,"01:14:28,399","01:14:30,628","That is great news, man."
tt0110912,"01:14:30,699","01:14:34,897","Yeah. Mm-hmm. No, me and Fabienne are gonna leave in the morning."

tt0110912,"01:56:00,950","01:56:05,178",You gotta have an opinion. You think God came down from Heaven and stopped--

tt0110912,"01:56:13,630","01:56:16,569","- Man, I seen some crazy-ass shit in my time, but this-- - Chill out, man !"
tt0110912,"01:56:16,629","01:56:19,568",It was an accident. We probably went over a bump or somethin'.
tt0110912,"01:56:19,639","01:56:21,568",The car ain't hit no motherfuckin' bump.
tt0110912,"01:56:21,638","01:56:24,966",I didn't mean to shoot the son of a bitch. The gun went off.
tt0110912,"01:56:25,038","01:56:28,476",Look at this fuckin' mess ! We're on a city street in broad daylight here !
tt0110912,"01:56:28,549","01:56:31,478","- I don't believe it ! - Well, believe it now, motherfucker !"
tt0110912,"01:56:31,549","01:56:35,007",We gotta get this car off the road. Cops notice shit like a car drenched in blood.
tt0110912,"01:56:34,588","01:56:37,517","- Just take it to a friendly place, that's all ! - This is the Valley, Vincent."
tt0110912,"01:56:37,588","01:56:40,017",Marsellus ain't got no friendly places in the Valley.

tt0110912,"01:56:43,097","01:56:46,026",- What you doing ? - I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.
tt0110912,"01:56:46,098","01:56:49,626","-Where's Toluca Lake ? -Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios."
tt0110912,"01:56:49,698","01:56:52,637","If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't know what the fuck we gonna do,"
tt0110912,"01:56:52,697","01:56:55,636",'cause I ain't got no other partners in 818.
tt0110912,"01:56:55,707","01:56:58,636","Jimmie, how you doin', man ? It's Jules. Just listen up, man."
tt0110912,"01:56:58,707","01:57:02,645","Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we gotta get it off the road, pronto."
tt0110912,"01:57:02,707","01:57:04,906",I need to use your garage for a couple hours.
tt0110912,"01:57:06,917","01:57:09,846",We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie situation.
tt0110912,"01:57:09,916","01:57:13,544",He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door.
tt0110912,"01:57:13,626","01:57:16,555","- If he does, what do we do ? - We ain't leavin' 'til we make a couple calls,"
tt0110912,"01:57:16,626","01:57:19,555",but I don't want it to reach that pitch-- Jimmie's a friend.
tt0110912,"01:57:19,625","01:57:22,564",You don't come into your friend's house and start tellin' him what's what.
tt0110912,"01:57:22,626","01:57:24,565",Just tell him not to be abusive.
tt0110912,"01:57:24,636","01:57:26,565",He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin.
tt0110912,"01:57:26,635","01:57:29,793","Put yourself in his position-- It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up."
tt0110912,"01:57:29,865","01:57:31,804",He wasn't expectin' this shit.
tt0110912,"01:57:31,875","01:57:34,804",We gotta remember here who's doin' who a favor.
tt0110912,"01:57:34,875","01:57:38,813","If that favor means I gotta take shit, he can stick that favor straight up his ass."
tt0110912,"01:57:39,175","01:57:43,113","- Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd you just do to his towel, man ? - I was dryin' my hands !"
tt0110912,"01:57:43,185","01:57:46,114",- You're supposed to wash 'em first ! - You watched me wash 'em.
tt0110912,"01:57:46,184","01:57:49,742",- I watched you get 'em wet. - I was washin' 'em. This shit's hard to get off.
tt0110912,"01:57:49,823","01:57:51,752",Maybe if he'd had Lava I coulda done a better job.
tt0110912,"01:57:51,824","01:57:53,753","I used the same fuckin' soap you did,"
tt0110912,"01:57:53,823","01:57:56,762","and when I finished, the towel didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad !"
tt0110912,"01:57:56,824","01:57:59,763",What if he was to come in here and see his towel like this ?
tt0110912,"01:57:59,833","01:58:03,921","It's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a head, man !"
tt0110912,"01:58:04,003","01:58:07,431","Look, I ain't threatenin' you or nothin', all right ?"
tt0110912,"01:58:07,503","01:58:11,961","You know I respect you and all. But just don't put me in this position, all right ?"
tt0110912,"01:58:12,042","01:58:14,741",All right. Fine. Fine.
tt0110912,"01:58:14,813","01:58:17,742","Ask me nice like that, no problem."
tt0110912,"01:58:17,812","01:58:20,751",Just go handle your friend. Go ahead. I don't care.
tt0110912,"01:58:22,482","01:58:25,351","Mmm ! Goddamn, Jimmie !"
tt0110912,"01:58:25,422","01:58:27,511",This some serious gourmet shit.
tt0110912,"01:58:27,592","01:58:29,521",Me and Vincent would've been satisfied...
tt0110912,"01:58:29,591","01:58:31,560",with some freeze-dried Taster's Choice.
tt0110912,"01:58:31,632","01:58:33,561",Right ?
tt0110912,"01:58:33,632","01:58:36,561",And he springs this serious gourmet shit on us.
tt0110912,"01:58:36,632","01:58:38,691","- What flavor is this ? - Knock it off, Julie."
tt0110912,"01:58:38,771","01:58:42,789",- What ? - I don't need you to tell me how fuckin' good my coffee is.
tt0110912,"01:58:42,871","01:58:45,360",I'm the one who buys it. I know how good it is.
tt0110912,"01:58:45,441","01:58:47,370","When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit."
tt0110912,"01:58:47,440","01:58:51,068","I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it."
tt0110912,"01:58:51,151","01:58:55,079",But you know what's on my mind right now ? It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.

tt0110912,"01:59:11,670","01:59:14,399",No. I didn't.
tt0110912,"01:59:14,469","01:59:17,398",- You know why you didn't see that sign ? - Why ?
tt0110912,"01:59:17,469","01:59:21,998","'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why !"
tt0110912,"01:59:22,078","01:59:25,007",- We're not gonna store the motherfucker-- - Don't you fuckin' realize...

tt0110912,"02:02:54,737","02:02:59,226","I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it much."
tt0110912,"02:02:59,307","02:03:03,605","- She wouldn't at that. - That gives us 40 minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge,"
tt0110912,"02:03:03,677","02:03:07,115","which, if you do what I say, when I say it, should be plenty."

tt0110912,"02:04:40,540","02:04:43,469",It don't need to be spick-and-span. You don't need to eat off it.
tt0110912,"02:04:43,540","02:04:47,908",Just give it a good once-over. What you need to take care of are the really messy parts.
tt0110912,"02:04:47,981","02:04:52,069","The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up."
tt0110912,"02:04:52,150","02:04:54,579",We need to raid your linen closet.

tt0110912,"02:09:05,686","02:09:09,124","Well, let's not start suckin' each other's dicks quite yet."
tt0110912,"02:09:09,185","02:09:12,623",Phase one is complete-- Clean the car-- which moves us right along to Phase two:

tt0110912,"02:09:38,664","02:09:42,032",Strippin' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary.
tt0110912,"02:09:46,344","02:09:48,813",Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.
tt0110912,"02:09:48,873","02:09:53,311","Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this shit out front for the garbageman to pick up."

tt0110912,"02:11:19,129","02:11:22,457","Now, I'll drive the tainted car. Jules, you ride with me."
tt0110912,"02:11:23,869","02:11:25,798","Vincent, you follow in my Acura."
tt0110912,"02:11:25,868","02:11:29,806","Now, if we come across the path of any John Q. Laws,"
tt0110912,"02:11:29,878","02:11:32,966",- nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something. - Right.
tt0110912,"02:11:33,048","02:11:35,977",- What did I say ? - Don't do shit unless.
tt0110912,"02:11:36,047","02:11:38,306",- Unless what ? - Unless you do it first.
tt0110912,"02:11:38,378","02:11:40,817",Spoken like a true prodigy.

tt0110912,"02:12:54,823","02:12:59,021",- Respect for one's elders shows character. - I have character.
tt0110912,"02:12:59,093","02:13:03,121",- Because you are a character doesn't mean that you have character.
tt0110912,"02:13:09,702","02:13:12,631",- Wanna share a cab ?
tt0110912,"02:13:12,702","02:13:16,970",- I'd go for some breakfast. Feel like havin' breakfast with me ?
tt0110912,"02:13:17,042","02:13:19,841",Cool.
tt0110912,"02:13:23,882","02:13:26,970","I don't know why, I just thought he'd be European or something."
tt0110912,"02:13:27,051","02:13:30,489","- Yeah, he's about as European as fuckin' English Bob. - I know that now."
tt0110912,"02:13:30,551","02:13:32,990",- But was he cool or what ? - Thank you.
tt0110912,"02:13:33,061","02:13:35,490","Totally fuckin' cool, in control."
tt0110912,"02:13:35,560","02:13:39,618",Didn't even really get pissed when you were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.
tt0110912,"02:13:39,700","02:13:42,289",- Want some bacon ?
tt0110912,"02:13:42,361","02:13:44,300","No, man, I don't eat pork."
tt0110912,"02:13:44,370","02:13:47,798","- Are you Jewish ? - I ain't Jewish; I just don't dig on swine, that's all."
tt0110912,"02:13:47,870","02:13:50,809",- Why not ? - Pigs are filthy animals.
tt0110912,"02:13:50,870","02:13:52,809",I don't eat filthy animals.
tt0110912,"02:13:52,880","02:13:56,308","Yeah, but bacon tastes good. Pork chops taste good."
tt0110912,"02:13:56,379","02:13:59,308","Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie, but I'd never know..."
tt0110912,"02:13:59,380","02:14:02,319",'cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers.
tt0110912,"02:14:02,379","02:14:05,318",Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's a filthy animal.
tt0110912,"02:14:05,389","02:14:09,317",I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got sense enough to disregard its own feces.
tt0110912,"02:14:09,389","02:14:13,727",- What about a dog ? Dog eats its own feces. - I don't eat dog either.
tt0110912,"02:14:13,799","02:14:17,127","Yeah, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal ?"
tt0110912,"02:14:17,199","02:14:20,128","I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy,"
tt0110912,"02:14:20,198","02:14:22,137",but they're definitely dirty.
tt0110912,"02:14:22,199","02:14:26,327","- But a dog's got personality. Personality goes a long way. - Ah, so, by that rationale,"
tt0110912,"02:14:26,408","02:14:29,966","if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal."
tt0110912,"02:14:30,047","02:14:33,975",- Is that true ? - We'd have to be talkin' about one charming motherfuckin' pig.
tt0110912,"02:14:34,047","02:14:38,075","I mean, he'd have to be ten times more charming than that Arnold on Green Acres."
tt0110912,"02:14:43,687","02:14:45,816","Oh, man, that's good."
tt0110912,"02:14:45,887","02:14:49,485","That's good, man. You're startin' to lighten up."
tt0110912,"02:14:49,567","02:14:52,555","You've been sittin' there, all serious and shit."
tt0110912,"02:14:52,636","02:14:55,065","- I just been sittin' here, thinkin'. - About what ?"

tt0110912,"02:14:58,137","02:15:01,405","- I witnessed a freak occurrence. - What is a miracle, Vincent ?"
tt0110912,"02:15:03,306","02:15:06,504",- Act of God. - And what's an act of God ?
tt0110912,"02:15:09,985","02:15:13,813","When, um, God makes the impossible possible."
tt0110912,"02:15:14,855","02:15:16,784",But this morning...
tt0110912,"02:15:16,855","02:15:19,584","- I don't think qualifies. - Hey, Vincent."
tt0110912,"02:15:19,655","02:15:23,353","See, that shit don't matter. You're judging this shit the wrong way."
tt0110912,"02:15:23,424","02:15:28,363","It could be God stopped the bullets, changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys."
tt0110912,"02:15:28,435","02:15:31,423",You don't judge shit like this based on merit.
tt0110912,"02:15:31,504","02:15:33,933","Now, whether or not what we experienced..."
tt0110912,"02:15:34,005","02:15:37,163",was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant.
tt0110912,"02:15:37,244","02:15:41,002","But what is significant is, I felt the touch of God."
tt0110912,"02:15:41,073","02:15:43,012",God got involved.
tt0110912,"02:15:43,084","02:15:44,803",But why ?
tt0110912,"02:15:44,883","02:15:47,901","Well, that's what's fuckin' with me: I don't know why."
tt0110912,"02:15:47,984","02:15:50,953",- But I can't go back to sleep. - You're serious.
tt0110912,"02:15:51,024","02:15:52,953",You're really thinkin' about quittin'.
tt0110912,"02:15:53,023","02:15:55,682",- For life ? Most definitely. - Yeah.
tt0110912,"02:15:55,753","02:15:59,121",Fuck. What you gonna do then ?
tt0110912,"02:16:00,433","02:16:04,661","Well, that's what I been sitting here contemplating."
tt0110912,"02:16:04,733","02:16:08,331",First I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus.
tt0110912,"02:16:08,402","02:16:11,490","Then, basically, I'm just gonna walk the Earth."
tt0110912,"02:16:11,572","02:16:15,010","- What you mean, ""walk the Earth"" ? - Like Caine in Kung Fu."
tt0110912,"02:16:15,072","02:16:18,041","Walk from place to place, meet people, get in adventures."
tt0110912,"02:16:18,112","02:16:20,371",And how long do you intend to walk the Earth ?
tt0110912,"02:16:20,451","02:16:23,749",- 'Til God puts me where He wants me to be. - What if He don't do that ?
tt0110912,"02:16:23,822","02:16:28,751","- If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever. - So you decided to be a bum."
tt0110912,"02:16:28,821","02:16:32,479","I'll just be Jules, Vincent. No more, no less."
tt0110912,"02:16:32,561","02:16:34,530","No, Jules, you decided to be a bum,"
tt0110912,"02:16:34,590","02:16:37,888","just like all those pieces of shit out there who beg for change,"

tt0110912,"02:16:40,971","02:16:43,940","They got a name for that, Jules. It's called a bum."
tt0110912,"02:16:44,000","02:16:47,668","And without a job, a residence or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be, man."

tt0110912,"02:17:22,948","02:17:26,886","Yeah. I was sittin' here eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee,"

tt0848228,"00:00:33,297","00:00:38,255","It is on a little world, a human world."
tt0848228,"00:00:38,970","00:00:42,302","They would wield its power,"
tt0848228,"00:00:42,681","00:00:48,351",but our ally knows its workings as they never will.
tt0848228,"00:00:49,897","00:00:52,981",<i>He is ready to lead</i>
tt0848228,"00:00:53,192","00:00:58,613","<i>and our force, our Chitauri, will follow.</i>"
tt0848228,"00:01:00,241","00:01:02,614",<i>A world will be his.</i>
tt0848228,"00:01:02,827","00:01:05,947","<i>The universe, yours.</i>"
tt0848228,"00:01:06,164","00:01:12,036","<i>And the humans, what can they do but burn?</i>"
tt0848228,"00:01:26,268","00:01:27,347","<i>All personnel,</i>"
tt0848228,"00:01:27,519","00:01:29,808",<i>the evacuation order has been confirmed.</i>
tt0848228,"00:02:01,722","00:02:03,180",How bad is it?
tt0848228,"00:02:03,389","00:02:06,675","That's the problem, sir. We don't know."
tt0848228,"00:02:10,271","00:02:13,189",Dr Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago.
tt0848228,"00:02:13,316","00:02:15,190",NASA didn't authorise Selvig to go to test phase.
tt0848228,"00:02:15,402","00:02:17,560",He wasn't testing it. He wasn't even in the room.
tt0848228,"00:02:17,779","00:02:18,775",Spontaneous event.
tt0848228,"00:02:18,947","00:02:20,062",It just turned itself on?
tt0848228,"00:02:20,282","00:02:21,313",Where are the energy levels now?
tt0848228,"00:02:21,533","00:02:23,692","Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered evac."
tt0848228,"00:02:23,911","00:02:25,109",How long to get everyone out?
tt0848228,"00:02:25,329","00:02:26,658",Campus should be clear in the next half-hour.
tt0848228,"00:02:26,872","00:02:28,117",Do better.
tt0848228,"00:02:29,083","00:02:31,039","Sir, evacuation may be futile."
tt0848228,"00:02:31,251","00:02:32,626",We should tell them to go back to sleep?
tt0848228,"00:02:32,836","00:02:35,043","If we can't control the Tesseract's energy,"
tt0848228,"00:02:35,255","00:02:37,581",there may not be a minimum safe distance.
tt0848228,"00:02:37,716","00:02:38,748",I need you to make sure
tt0848228,"00:02:38,884","00:02:40,544",the Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.
tt0848228,"00:02:40,720","00:02:42,759","Sir, is that really a priority right now?"
tt0848228,"00:02:42,972","00:02:44,680","Until such time as the world ends,"
tt0848228,"00:02:44,807","00:02:46,847",we will act as though it intends to spin on.
tt0848228,"00:02:47,810","00:02:49,186",Clear out the tech below.
tt0848228,"00:02:49,395","00:02:51,887",Every piece of Phase 2 on a truck and gone.
tt0848228,"00:02:52,107","00:02:53,186","Yes, sir."
tt0848228,"00:02:53,608","00:02:54,771",With me.
tt0848228,"00:02:57,862","00:02:58,858","Talk to me, Doctor."
tt0848228,"00:03:00,656","00:03:02,032",Director.
tt0848228,"00:03:02,241","00:03:03,902",Is there anything we know for certain?
tt0848228,"00:03:04,118","00:03:06,360",The Tesseract is misbehaving.
tt0848228,"00:03:06,579","00:03:09,367","- Is that supposed to be funny? - No, it's not funny at all."
tt0848228,"00:03:09,583","00:03:13,082","The Tesseract is not only active, she's behaving."
tt0848228,"00:03:13,295","00:03:14,291",I assume you pulled the plug.
tt0848228,"00:03:14,505","00:03:16,213",She's an energy source.
tt0848228,"00:03:16,423","00:03:19,460","We turn off the power, she turns it back on."
tt0848228,"00:03:19,677","00:03:20,756",If she reaches peak level...
tt0848228,"00:03:20,970","00:03:24,385","We prepared for this, Doctor. Harnessing energy from space."
tt0848228,"00:03:24,598","00:03:25,973",But we don't have the harness.
tt0848228,"00:03:26,099","00:03:27,380",My calculations are far from complete.
tt0848228,"00:03:27,935","00:03:30,473","And she's throwing off interference, radiation."
tt0848228,"00:03:30,688","00:03:32,396","Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation."
tt0848228,"00:03:33,315","00:03:35,142",That can be harmful.
tt0848228,"00:03:35,359","00:03:36,770",Where's Agent Barton?
tt0848228,"00:03:36,944","00:03:38,652",The Hawk?
tt0848228,"00:03:39,530","00:03:41,570","Up in his nest, as usual."
tt0848228,"00:03:43,034","00:03:44,826","<i>Agent Barton, report.</i>"
tt0848228,"00:03:45,704","00:03:46,866",<i>I gave you this detail</i>
tt0848228,"00:03:46,997","00:03:48,574",<i>so you could keep a close eye on things.</i>
tt0848228,"00:03:48,790","00:03:50,166","Well, I see better from a distance."
tt0848228,"00:03:50,375","00:03:52,332",Have you seen anything that might set this thing off?
tt0848228,"00:03:52,793","00:03:54,917","Doctor, it's spiking again."
tt0848228,"00:03:55,129","00:03:56,505",No one's come or gone.
tt0848228,"00:03:56,714","00:03:58,339",And Selvig's clean.
tt0848228,"00:03:58,550","00:04:00,839","No contacts, no IMs."
tt0848228,"00:04:01,344","00:04:03,136","If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end."
tt0848228,"00:04:05,057","00:04:06,432","""At this end""?"
tt0848228,"00:04:06,642","00:04:10,474","Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right?"
tt0848228,"00:04:12,314","00:04:13,595",Doors open from both sides.
tt0848228,"00:04:14,358","00:04:15,687",Not yet.
tt0848228,"00:05:23,596","00:05:26,716","Sir, please put down the spear."
tt0848228,"00:06:06,057","00:06:07,218",You have heart.
tt0848228,"00:06:37,797","00:06:39,291",Please don't.
tt0848228,"00:06:41,092","00:06:42,290",I still need that.
tt0848228,"00:06:42,510","00:06:43,969",This doesn't have to get any messier.
tt0848228,"00:06:44,179","00:06:45,377",Of course it does.
tt0848228,"00:06:45,597","00:06:47,471",I've come too far for anything else.
tt0848228,"00:06:49,434","00:06:52,222","I am Loki, of Asgard"
tt0848228,"00:06:52,938","00:06:55,310",and I am burdened with glorious purpose.
tt0848228,"00:06:55,524","00:06:56,935","Loki,"
tt0848228,"00:06:57,443","00:06:58,723",brother of Thor.
tt0848228,"00:06:58,945","00:07:01,399",We have no quarrel with your people.
tt0848228,"00:07:01,613","00:07:04,567",An ant has no quarrel with a boot.
tt0848228,"00:07:05,159","00:07:06,819",Are you planning to step on us?
tt0848228,"00:07:07,161","00:07:10,245",I come with glad tidings
tt0848228,"00:07:11,499","00:07:13,408",of a world made free.
tt0848228,"00:07:13,793","00:07:14,789",Free from what?
tt0848228,"00:07:15,002","00:07:16,331",Freedom.
tt0848228,"00:07:16,879","00:07:19,501",Freedom is life's great lie.
tt0848228,"00:07:19,716","00:07:23,132","Once you accept that, in your heart,"
tt0848228,"00:07:27,641","00:07:29,514",you will know peace.
tt0848228,"00:07:29,809","00:07:32,265","Yeah, you say ""peace,"""
tt0848228,"00:07:32,478","00:07:34,305",I kind of think you mean the other thing.
tt0848228,"00:07:34,522","00:07:37,013","Sir, Director Fury is stalling."
tt0848228,"00:07:37,233","00:07:38,562",This place is about to blow
tt0848228,"00:07:38,693","00:07:40,401",and drop a hundred feet of rock on us.
tt0848228,"00:07:41,905","00:07:42,936",He means to bury us.
tt0848228,"00:07:43,156","00:07:44,271",Like the pharaohs of old.
tt0848228,"00:07:44,491","00:07:46,448",He's right. The portal is collapsing in on itself.
tt0848228,"00:07:46,660","00:07:48,867",We've got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.
tt0848228,"00:07:49,246","00:07:50,242","Well, then."
tt0848228,"00:08:06,013","00:08:07,092",I need these vehicles.
tt0848228,"00:08:11,185","00:08:13,308",- Who's that? - They didn't tell me.
tt0848228,"00:08:16,524","00:08:17,769",<i>Hill!</i>
tt0848228,"00:08:18,193","00:08:19,473",Do you copy?
tt0848228,"00:08:20,195","00:08:21,523",<i>Barton has turned.</i>
tt0848228,"00:08:34,584","00:08:37,420",They have the Tesseract! Shut them down!
tt0848228,"00:09:13,834","00:09:16,040","Okay, let's go. No, leave it. Go!"
tt0848228,"00:09:32,519","00:09:34,642","We're clear upstairs, sir. You need to go."
tt0848228,"00:11:06,616","00:11:07,944",<i>Director?</i>
tt0848228,"00:11:08,284","00:11:09,778","Director Fury, do you copy?"
tt0848228,"00:11:09,994","00:11:12,283",The Tesseract is with a hostile force.
tt0848228,"00:11:12,539","00:11:14,946",I have men down. Hill?
tt0848228,"00:11:15,292","00:11:17,165",A lot of men still under.
tt0848228,"00:11:17,377","00:11:19,085",I don't know how many survivors.
tt0848228,"00:11:19,296","00:11:20,459",<i>Sound a general call.</i>
tt0848228,"00:11:20,672","00:11:22,380",I want every living soul not working rescue
tt0848228,"00:11:22,508","00:11:23,504",looking for that briefcase.
tt0848228,"00:11:23,717","00:11:24,749",Roger that.
tt0848228,"00:11:24,969","00:11:28,254","Coulson, get back to base. This is a Level Seven."
tt0848228,"00:11:29,348","00:11:30,926","<i>As of right now,</i>"
tt0848228,"00:11:31,142","00:11:32,600",we are at war.
tt0848228,"00:11:34,311","00:11:35,591",What do we do?
tt0848228,"00:13:21,380","00:13:23,123",...you may have to write it down.
tt0848228,"00:13:38,439","00:13:41,013","<i>You're at 1- 14 Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor.</i>"
tt0848228,"00:13:41,276","00:13:43,399",<i>We have an F-22 exactly eight miles out.</i>
tt0848228,"00:13:44,279","00:13:46,236","<i>Put the woman on the phone, or I will blow up the block</i>"
tt0848228,"00:13:46,448","00:13:48,487",<i>before you can make the lobby.</i>
tt0848228,"00:13:54,956","00:13:57,079",<i>- We need you to come in. - Are you kidding? I'm working.</i>
tt0848228,"00:13:57,292","00:13:58,572",<i>This takes precedence.</i>
tt0848228,"00:13:58,794","00:14:00,418",I'm in the middle of an interrogation.
tt0848228,"00:14:00,587","00:14:02,379",This moron is giving me everything.
tt0848228,"00:14:02,798","00:14:05,419",I don't give everything.
tt0848228,"00:14:06,844","00:14:08,219","Look, you can't pull me out of this right now."
tt0848228,"00:14:08,345","00:14:09,341",<i>Natasha...</i>
tt0848228,"00:14:10,931","00:14:12,426",Barton's been compromised.
tt0848228,"00:14:15,644","00:14:17,471",Let me put you on hold.
tt0848228,"00:14:59,231","00:15:00,227",Where is Barton now?
tt0848228,"00:15:00,399","00:15:01,893",<i>- We don't know. - But he's alive?</i>
tt0848228,"00:15:02,109","00:15:04,896",We think so. I'll brief you on everything when you get back.
tt0848228,"00:15:05,154","00:15:07,194","But first, we need you to talk to the big guy."
tt0848228,"00:15:07,406","00:15:10,490","Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me."
tt0848228,"00:15:10,701","00:15:14,200",I've got Stark. You get the big guy.
tt0848228,"00:15:44,235","00:15:45,231",You're a doctor.
tt0848228,"00:16:02,546","00:16:03,791",Please.
tt0848228,"00:16:30,992","00:16:33,281","You should've got paid up front, Banner."
tt0848228,"00:16:33,494","00:16:34,775","You know, for a man"
tt0848228,"00:16:34,913","00:16:36,193",who's supposed to be avoiding stress
tt0848228,"00:16:36,414","00:16:39,665",you picked a hell of a place to settle.
tt0848228,"00:16:41,420","00:16:43,626",Avoiding stress isn't the secret.
tt0848228,"00:16:43,839","00:16:46,330",Then what is it? Yoga?
tt0848228,"00:16:47,509","00:16:50,676",You brought me to the edge of the city. Smart.
tt0848228,"00:16:51,263","00:16:55,308",I assume the whole place is surrounded.
tt0848228,"00:16:55,768","00:16:57,143",Just you and me.
tt0848228,"00:16:58,395","00:17:00,435",And your actress buddy?
tt0848228,"00:17:00,647","00:17:02,605","Is she a spy, too? They start that young?"
tt0848228,"00:17:03,025","00:17:04,270",I did.
tt0848228,"00:17:04,485","00:17:05,516",Who are you?
tt0848228,"00:17:05,736","00:17:06,851",Natasha Romanoff.
tt0848228,"00:17:10,199","00:17:11,528","Are you here to kill me, Ms Romanoff?"
tt0848228,"00:17:11,743","00:17:14,448",Because that's not going to work out for everyone.
tt0848228,"00:17:14,662","00:17:17,118","No, of course not. I'm here on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D."
tt0848228,"00:17:18,875","00:17:20,369",S.H.I.E.L.D.
tt0848228,"00:17:22,170","00:17:23,165",How did they find me?
tt0848228,"00:17:23,337","00:17:24,962","We never lost you, Doctor."
tt0848228,"00:17:25,173","00:17:26,168",We've kept our distance.
tt0848228,"00:17:26,382","00:17:28,174",Even helped keep some other interested parties
tt0848228,"00:17:28,343","00:17:29,374",off your scent.
tt0848228,"00:17:29,886","00:17:30,882",Why?
tt0848228,"00:17:31,012","00:17:33,384",Nick Fury seems to trust you.
tt0848228,"00:17:33,598","00:17:35,223",But now we need you to come in.
tt0848228,"00:17:36,184","00:17:38,058",What if I say no?
tt0848228,"00:17:38,270","00:17:40,393",I'll persuade you.
tt0848228,"00:17:42,524","00:17:46,854",And what if the other guy says no?
tt0848228,"00:17:47,571","00:17:49,196",You've been more than a year without an incident.
tt0848228,"00:17:49,407","00:17:51,979",I don't think you want to break that streak.
tt0848228,"00:17:54,203","00:17:56,824","Well, I don't every time get what I want."
tt0848228,"00:17:57,873","00:18:00,080","Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe."
tt0848228,"00:18:00,918","00:18:04,038","Well, those I actively try to avoid."
tt0848228,"00:18:04,380","00:18:06,420",This
tt0848228,"00:18:06,632","00:18:09,005",is the Tesseract.
tt0848228,"00:18:09,219","00:18:12,006",It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.
tt0848228,"00:18:14,850","00:18:17,008","What does Fury want me to do, swallow it?"
tt0848228,"00:18:17,226","00:18:19,682",He wants you to find it. It's been taken.
tt0848228,"00:18:20,521","00:18:24,685",It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace.
tt0848228,"00:18:24,901","00:18:27,819",There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do.
tt0848228,"00:18:28,029","00:18:30,817","If there was, that's where I'd be."
tt0848228,"00:18:31,408","00:18:33,567","So, Fury isn't after the monster?"
tt0848228,"00:18:33,785","00:18:35,031",Not that he's told me.
tt0848228,"00:18:35,245","00:18:37,404",And he tells you everything?
tt0848228,"00:18:38,082","00:18:39,457",Talk to Fury. He needs you on this.
tt0848228,"00:18:39,583","00:18:40,615",He needs me in a cage?
tt0848228,"00:18:40,751","00:18:41,747",No one's going to put you in a...
tt0848228,"00:18:41,919","00:18:42,915",Stop lying to me!
tt0848228,"00:18:47,132","00:18:49,754",I'm sorry. That was mean.
tt0848228,"00:18:50,719","00:18:52,878",I just wanted to see what you'd do.
tt0848228,"00:18:54,098","00:18:57,052",Why don't we do this the easy way
tt0848228,"00:18:57,268","00:18:58,513",where you don't use that
tt0848228,"00:18:58,728","00:19:02,642",and the other guy doesn't make a mess.
tt0848228,"00:19:03,441","00:19:04,722",Okay?
tt0848228,"00:19:05,735","00:19:07,064",Natasha?
tt0848228,"00:19:12,742","00:19:13,773",Stand down.
tt0848228,"00:19:14,744","00:19:16,286",<i>We're good here.</i>
tt0848228,"00:19:18,122","00:19:19,665","""Just you and me."""
tt0848228,"00:19:21,835","00:19:24,408","<i>This is out of line, Director.</i>"
tt0848228,"00:19:24,629","00:19:27,037",<i>You're dealing with forces you can't control.</i>
tt0848228,"00:19:27,466","00:19:30,917","You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight?"
tt0848228,"00:19:31,136","00:19:33,924",Did you feel an overabundance of control?
tt0848228,"00:19:34,140","00:19:37,509",<i>You're saying that this Asgard is declaring war on our planet?</i>
tt0848228,"00:19:37,643","00:19:40,264",Not Asgard. Loki.
tt0848228,"00:19:40,479","00:19:43,266",<i>He can't be working alone. What about the other one?</i>
tt0848228,"00:19:43,398","00:19:44,430",<i>His brother.</i>
tt0848228,"00:19:44,566","00:19:46,606",Our intelligence says Thor is not a hostile
tt0848228,"00:19:46,819","00:19:47,815",but he's worlds away.
tt0848228,"00:19:47,987","00:19:49,778","We can't depend on him to help, either."
tt0848228,"00:19:49,905","00:19:50,901",It's up to us.
tt0848228,"00:19:51,032","00:19:53,653",<i>Which is why you should be focusing on Phase 2.</i>
tt0848228,"00:19:53,826","00:19:55,107",<i>It was designed for exactly this...</i>
tt0848228,"00:19:55,328","00:19:58,495",Phase 2 isn't ready. Our enemy is.
tt0848228,"00:19:58,748","00:20:00,290",We need a response team.
tt0848228,"00:20:00,500","00:20:02,789",<i>The Avengers Initiative was shut down.</i>
tt0848228,"00:20:03,003","00:20:04,794",This isn't about the Avengers.
tt0848228,"00:20:05,005","00:20:06,119",<i>We've seen the list.</i>
tt0848228,"00:20:06,339","00:20:08,545",<i>You're running the world's greatest covert security network</i>
tt0848228,"00:20:08,674","00:20:10,299",<i>and you're going to leave the fate of the human race</i>
tt0848228,"00:20:10,468","00:20:11,713",<i>to a handful of freaks.</i>
tt0848228,"00:20:11,845","00:20:13,754",I'm not leaving anything to anyone.
tt0848228,"00:20:13,972","00:20:16,178",We need a response team.
tt0848228,"00:20:16,433","00:20:19,138","These people may be isolated, unbalanced even"
tt0848228,"00:20:19,353","00:20:23,516",but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need.
tt0848228,"00:20:23,816","00:20:25,096",<i>You believe?</i>
tt0848228,"00:20:25,317","00:20:28,900","<i>War isn't won by sentiment, Director.</i>"
tt0848228,"00:20:29,613","00:20:32,946","No, it's won by soldiers."
tt0848228,"00:20:52,595","00:20:54,387",<i>There's not enough time.</i>
tt0848228,"00:20:54,598","00:20:56,140",<i>I got to put her in the water!</i>
tt0848228,"00:21:01,521","00:21:02,552",<i>You won't be alone.</i>
tt0848228,"00:21:03,147","00:21:04,642","<i>Oh, my God.</i>"
tt0848228,"00:21:05,108","00:21:06,270",<i>This guy is still alive!</i>
tt0848228,"00:21:31,051","00:21:32,795",Trouble sleeping?
tt0848228,"00:21:34,138","00:21:36,807","I slept for 70 years, sir. I think I've had my fill."
tt0848228,"00:21:38,351","00:21:42,265","Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world."
tt0848228,"00:21:48,111","00:21:50,946","When I went under, the world was at war."
tt0848228,"00:21:51,156","00:21:52,983","I wake up, they say we won."
tt0848228,"00:21:53,699","00:21:55,242",They didn't say what we lost.
tt0848228,"00:21:55,827","00:21:58,152",We've made some mistakes along the way.
tt0848228,"00:21:58,579","00:22:00,240","Some, very recently."
tt0848228,"00:22:01,791","00:22:02,989","Are you here with a mission, sir?"
tt0848228,"00:22:03,126","00:22:04,122",I am.
tt0848228,"00:22:04,252","00:22:05,912",Trying to get me back in the world?
tt0848228,"00:22:06,421","00:22:08,081",Trying to save it.
tt0848228,"00:22:12,761","00:22:14,754",HYDRA's secret weapon.
tt0848228,"00:22:14,972","00:22:17,048",Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean
tt0848228,"00:22:17,183","00:22:18,297",when he was looking for you.
tt0848228,"00:22:18,851","00:22:20,511",He thought what we think.
tt0848228,"00:22:20,769","00:22:24,897",The Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy.
tt0848228,"00:22:25,357","00:22:29,189",That's something the world sorely needs.
tt0848228,"00:22:30,696","00:22:31,859",Who took it from you?
tt0848228,"00:22:32,073","00:22:33,483",He's called Loki.
tt0848228,"00:22:33,699","00:22:36,321",He's not from around here.
tt0848228,"00:22:36,786","00:22:38,862",There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on
tt0848228,"00:22:38,997","00:22:40,195",if you're in.
tt0848228,"00:22:41,124","00:22:43,164",The world has gotten even stranger
tt0848228,"00:22:43,293","00:22:44,372",than you already know.
tt0848228,"00:22:44,878","00:22:47,452","At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me."
tt0848228,"00:22:48,089","00:22:49,749",Ten bucks says you're wrong.
tt0848228,"00:22:51,509","00:22:52,884",There's a debriefing packet
tt0848228,"00:22:53,011","00:22:55,383",waiting for you back at your apartment.
tt0848228,"00:22:57,766","00:22:59,675",Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract
tt0848228,"00:22:59,810","00:23:01,008",that we ought to know now?
tt0848228,"00:23:01,311","00:23:03,600",You should have left it in the ocean.
tt0848228,"00:23:36,348","00:23:39,218",<i>Good to go on this end. The rest is up to you.</i>
tt0848228,"00:23:39,434","00:23:40,763",<i>You disconnected the transmission lines?</i>
tt0848228,"00:23:40,894","00:23:41,889",<i>Are we off the grid?</i>
tt0848228,"00:23:42,019","00:23:44,178",Stark Tower is about to become a beacon
tt0848228,"00:23:44,355","00:23:45,814",of self-sustaining clean energy.
tt0848228,"00:23:45,940","00:23:47,980","<i>Well, assuming the arc reactor takes over</i>"
tt0848228,"00:23:48,109","00:23:49,307",<i>and it actually works.</i>
tt0848228,"00:23:49,694","00:23:50,975",<i>I assume.</i>
tt0848228,"00:23:51,488","00:23:52,484",Light her up.
tt0848228,"00:23:58,036","00:23:59,032",<i>How does it look?</i>
tt0848228,"00:23:59,204","00:24:01,874","Like Christmas, but with more me."
tt0848228,"00:24:02,082","00:24:03,826",<i>We've got to go wider on the public awareness campaign.</i>
tt0848228,"00:24:04,043","00:24:05,074",<i>You need to do some press.</i>
tt0848228,"00:24:05,711","00:24:06,707","<i>I'm in DC tomorrow,</i>"
tt0848228,"00:24:06,879","00:24:08,373",<i>I'm working on the zoning for the next three buildings.</i>
tt0848228,"00:24:08,548","00:24:10,753","<i>Pepper, you're killing me. The moment, remember?</i>"
tt0848228,"00:24:10,966","00:24:11,997",<i>Enjoy the moment.</i>
tt0848228,"00:24:12,217","00:24:13,380",<i>Get in here and I will.</i>
tt0848228,"00:24:16,722","00:24:19,640","<i>Sir, Agent Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D. Is on the line.</i>"
tt0848228,"00:24:20,226","00:24:21,222",<i>I'm not in.</i>
tt0848228,"00:24:21,894","00:24:23,175",I'm actually out.
tt0848228,"00:24:30,403","00:24:33,025","<i>Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.</i>"
tt0848228,"00:24:33,240","00:24:35,991","Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date."
tt0848228,"00:24:40,538","00:24:43,492","Levels are holding steady, I think."
tt0848228,"00:24:43,708","00:24:45,867",Of course they are. I was directly involved.
tt0848228,"00:24:46,086","00:24:47,248",Which brings me to my next question.
tt0848228,"00:24:47,420","00:24:49,378",How does it feel to be a genius?
tt0848228,"00:24:49,589","00:24:51,831","Well, I really wouldn't know, now would I?"
tt0848228,"00:24:52,050","00:24:56,547",What do you mean? All this came from you.
tt0848228,"00:24:56,764","00:25:00,382","No, all this came from that."
tt0848228,"00:25:00,601","00:25:02,890",Give yourself some credit. Please.
tt0848228,"00:25:03,103","00:25:04,894",Stark Tower is your baby.
tt0848228,"00:25:05,105","00:25:07,477",Give yourself 12% of the credit.
tt0848228,"00:25:07,941","00:25:09,056",12%?
tt0848228,"00:25:09,193","00:25:10,307",An argument can be made for 15.
tt0848228,"00:25:10,444","00:25:12,022",12%? My baby?
tt0848228,"00:25:12,238","00:25:13,815","Well, I did do all the heavy lifting."
tt0848228,"00:25:13,948","00:25:15,822","Literally, I lifted the heavy things."
tt0848228,"00:25:16,075","00:25:18,317","And, sorry, but the security snafu?"
tt0848228,"00:25:18,453","00:25:19,911",That was on you.
tt0848228,"00:25:20,079","00:25:22,155",#NAME?
tt0848228,"00:25:22,373","00:25:25,043",...it was teeming with sweaty workmen.
tt0848228,"00:25:25,252","00:25:27,577",I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages
tt0848228,"00:25:27,796","00:25:29,753","in some subtle way later, aren't I?"
tt0848228,"00:25:30,214","00:25:31,412",It's not going to be that subtle.
tt0848228,"00:25:31,632","00:25:32,913",I'll tell you what.
tt0848228,"00:25:33,134","00:25:35,590","The next building is gonna say ""Potts"" on the tower."
tt0848228,"00:25:35,803","00:25:37,179",On the lease.
tt0848228,"00:25:38,098","00:25:40,221",Call your mom. Can you bunk over?
tt0848228,"00:25:40,433","00:25:41,678","<i>Sir, the telephone.</i>"
tt0848228,"00:25:41,893","00:25:44,266",<i>I'm afraid my protocols are being overridden.</i>
tt0848228,"00:25:44,479","00:25:46,437","<i>Mr Stark, we need to talk.</i>"
tt0848228,"00:25:46,732","00:25:49,057",You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark.
tt0848228,"00:25:49,318","00:25:51,275",<i>- Please leave a message. - This is urgent.</i>
tt0848228,"00:25:51,487","00:25:53,278",Then leave it urgently.
tt0848228,"00:25:54,824","00:25:55,938",Security breach. It's on you.
tt0848228,"00:25:56,159","00:25:58,862",#NAME?

tt0848228,"00:26:00,162","00:26:01,193",I can't stay.

tt0848228,"00:26:02,831","00:26:04,456",Come on in. We're celebrating.
tt0848228,"00:26:04,667","00:26:06,458",Which is why he can't stay.
tt0848228,"00:26:06,669","00:26:08,626",We need you to look this over as soon as possible.
tt0848228,"00:26:08,838","00:26:09,869",I don't like being handed things.
tt0848228,"00:26:10,089","00:26:11,548","That's fine, because I love to be handed things."
tt0848228,"00:26:11,757","00:26:13,086","So, let's trade."
tt0848228,"00:26:14,469","00:26:15,963",Thank you.
tt0848228,"00:26:17,180","00:26:19,386",Official consulting hours are between 8 and 5
tt0848228,"00:26:19,516","00:26:20,512",every other Thursday.
tt0848228,"00:26:20,684","00:26:21,680",This isn't a consultation.
tt0848228,"00:26:21,810","00:26:23,055",Is this about the Avengers?
tt0848228,"00:26:23,478","00:26:25,304",Which I know nothing about.
tt0848228,"00:26:25,521","00:26:28,059","The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought."
tt0848228,"00:26:28,274","00:26:29,650",And I didn't even qualify.
tt0848228,"00:26:29,859","00:26:30,855",I didn't know that either.
tt0848228,"00:26:31,027","00:26:33,898","Apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed,"
tt0848228,"00:26:34,030","00:26:35,275",don't play well with others.
tt0848228,"00:26:35,574","00:26:36,569",That I did know.
tt0848228,"00:26:36,700","00:26:38,324",This isn't about personality profiles any more.
tt0848228,"00:26:38,493","00:26:40,819","Whatever. Ms Potts, got a second?"
tt0848228,"00:26:41,038","00:26:42,034",Half a mo.
tt0848228,"00:26:47,336","00:26:49,662","You know, I thought we were having a moment."
tt0848228,"00:26:49,881","00:26:51,457",I was having 12% of a moment.
tt0848228,"00:26:52,674","00:26:55,130",This seems serious. Phil's pretty shaken.
tt0848228,"00:26:55,344","00:26:57,301","How would you know if it's... Why is he ""Phil""?"
tt0848228,"00:26:57,513","00:26:59,256",What is all this?
tt0848228,"00:26:59,473","00:27:01,015",This is
tt0848228,"00:27:01,726","00:27:02,721",this.
tt0848228,"00:27:10,068","00:27:11,443",I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.
tt0848228,"00:27:11,569","00:27:12,601",Tomorrow.
tt0848228,"00:27:12,737","00:27:15,026",You have homework. You have a lot of homework.
tt0848228,"00:27:15,240","00:27:16,948","Well, what if I didn't?"
tt0848228,"00:27:17,576","00:27:18,950",- Lf you didn't? - Yeah.
tt0848228,"00:27:19,160","00:27:21,318",You mean when you've finished?
tt0848228,"00:27:22,413","00:27:25,699","Well, then..."
tt0848228,"00:27:30,922","00:27:32,203",Square deal. Fly safe.
tt0848228,"00:27:36,428","00:27:37,543",Work hard.
tt0848228,"00:27:40,433","00:27:42,176","So, any chance you're driving by LaGuardia?"
tt0848228,"00:27:42,393","00:27:45,145",#NAME?
tt0848228,"00:27:45,271","00:27:46,266",I want to hear
tt0848228,"00:27:46,396","00:27:48,056",about the cellist. Is that still a thing?
tt0848228,"00:27:48,273","00:27:49,388",She moved back to Portland.
tt0848228,"00:27:49,608","00:27:52,728",What? Boo!
tt0848228,"00:28:00,787","00:28:03,194","We're about 40 minutes out from home base, sir."
tt0848228,"00:28:06,918","00:28:10,583","So, this Dr Banner was trying to replicate the serum they used on me?"
tt0848228,"00:28:10,797","00:28:12,340",A lot of people were.
tt0848228,"00:28:12,548","00:28:14,173",You were the world's first superhero.
tt0848228,"00:28:14,884","00:28:17,589",Banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking
tt0848228,"00:28:17,762","00:28:19,091",Erskine's original formula.
tt0848228,"00:28:20,140","00:28:21,515","Didn't really go his way, did it?"
tt0848228,"00:28:21,933","00:28:23,392",Not so much.
tt0848228,"00:28:23,602","00:28:26,437","When he's not that thing, though, the guy's like a Stephen Hawking."
tt0848228,"00:28:28,482","00:28:31,020",He's like a smart person.
tt0848228,"00:28:33,153","00:28:34,268","I gotta say,"
tt0848228,"00:28:34,613","00:28:37,021",it's an honour to meet you officially.
tt0848228,"00:28:37,783","00:28:39,278","I've sort of met you. I mean,"
tt0848228,"00:28:39,452","00:28:41,242",I watched you while you were sleeping.
tt0848228,"00:28:43,080","00:28:45,286","I mean, I was present"
tt0848228,"00:28:45,499","00:28:48,785",while you were unconscious from the ice.
tt0848228,"00:28:49,003","00:28:51,292","You know, it's really just a huge honour"
tt0848228,"00:28:51,422","00:28:53,379",to have you on board this...
tt0848228,"00:28:53,758","00:28:55,632",I hope I'm the man for the job.
tt0848228,"00:28:55,843","00:28:58,714","Oh, you are. Absolutely."
tt0848228,"00:28:58,930","00:29:01,801",We made some modifications to the uniform.
tt0848228,"00:29:02,017","00:29:03,511",I had a little design input.
tt0848228,"00:29:03,727","00:29:04,972",The uniform?
tt0848228,"00:29:05,187","00:29:07,677",Aren't the stars and stripes a little
tt0848228,"00:29:08,856","00:29:10,185",old-fashioned?
tt0848228,"00:29:11,025","00:29:13,184",With everything that's happening
tt0848228,"00:29:13,403","00:29:15,027","and the things that are about to come to light,"
tt0848228,"00:29:15,905","00:29:19,357",people might just need a little old-fashioned.
tt0848228,"00:29:51,901","00:29:54,855",The Chitauri grow restless.
tt0848228,"00:29:55,071","00:29:56,779",Let them gird themselves.
tt0848228,"00:29:56,907","00:29:58,698",I will lead them in the glorious battle.
tt0848228,"00:29:58,909","00:30:00,071",Battle?
tt0848228,"00:30:00,910","00:30:03,994",Against the meagre might of Earth?
tt0848228,"00:30:04,205","00:30:07,040","Glorious, not lengthy."
tt0848228,"00:30:07,250","00:30:11,034",If your force is as formidable as you claim.
tt0848228,"00:30:11,254","00:30:13,745",You question us?
tt0848228,"00:30:13,965","00:30:16,089","You question him,"
tt0848228,"00:30:16,260","00:30:18,715",he who put the sceptre in your hand?
tt0848228,"00:30:18,929","00:30:21,847",Who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose
tt0848228,"00:30:22,057","00:30:24,928","when you were cast out, defeated?"
tt0848228,"00:30:25,144","00:30:27,018",I was a king!
tt0848228,"00:30:27,230","00:30:29,435","The rightful king of Asgard,"
tt0848228,"00:30:29,940","00:30:30,936",betrayed.
tt0848228,"00:30:31,608","00:30:34,230",Your ambition is little
tt0848228,"00:30:34,445","00:30:37,197",and born of childish need.
tt0848228,"00:30:37,406","00:30:39,399",We look beyond the Earth
tt0848228,"00:30:39,617","00:30:42,571",to the greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil.
tt0848228,"00:30:43,037","00:30:44,448",You don't have the Tesseract yet.
tt0848228,"00:30:47,250","00:30:48,246",I don't threaten.
tt0848228,"00:30:49,794","00:30:52,368","But until I open the doors,"
tt0848228,"00:30:52,589","00:30:56,206","until your force is mine to command,"
tt0848228,"00:30:56,968","00:30:58,759",you are but words.
tt0848228,"00:30:58,970","00:31:02,920","You will have your war, Asgardian."
tt0848228,"00:31:04,726","00:31:06,719","If you fail,"
tt0848228,"00:31:07,729","00:31:12,107","if the Tesseract is kept from us,"
tt0848228,"00:31:12,317","00:31:16,695","there will be no realm, no barren moon,"
tt0848228,"00:31:16,906","00:31:20,191",no crevice where he cannot find you.
tt0848228,"00:31:21,786","00:31:24,537",You think you know pain?
tt0848228,"00:31:24,746","00:31:30,417",He will make you long for something sweet as pain.
tt0848228,"00:31:59,616","00:32:00,647",Stow the captain's gear.
tt0848228,"00:32:00,784","00:32:01,780","Yes, sir."
tt0848228,"00:32:03,328","00:32:06,448","Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers."
tt0848228,"00:32:06,665","00:32:07,946",- Ma'am. - Hi.
tt0848228,"00:32:08,125","00:32:09,121",They need you on the bridge.
tt0848228,"00:32:09,251","00:32:10,746",They're starting the face-trace.
tt0848228,"00:32:10,961","00:32:12,041",See you there.
tt0848228,"00:32:13,798","00:32:17,925","It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice."
tt0848228,"00:32:18,218","00:32:20,792",I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.
tt0848228,"00:32:21,013","00:32:23,884",Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?
tt0848228,"00:32:24,099","00:32:25,298",Trading cards?
tt0848228,"00:32:25,518","00:32:27,676",They're vintage. He's very proud.
tt0848228,"00:32:29,438","00:32:30,719",Dr Banner.
tt0848228,"00:32:32,734","00:32:34,014","Yeah, hi."
tt0848228,"00:32:34,569","00:32:35,767",They told me you would be coming.
tt0848228,"00:32:35,987","00:32:37,268","Word is, you can find the Cube."
tt0848228,"00:32:38,323","00:32:40,197",Is that the only word on me?
tt0848228,"00:32:40,617","00:32:41,780",Only word I care about.
tt0848228,"00:32:44,370","00:32:46,956","It must be strange for you, all of this."
tt0848228,"00:32:47,665","00:32:50,335","Well, this is actually kind of familiar."
tt0848228,"00:32:50,543","00:32:53,117","Gentlemen, you might want to step inside in a minute."
tt0848228,"00:32:53,338","00:32:56,090",It's going to get a little hard to breathe.
tt0848228,"00:32:57,342","00:32:58,884","<i>Flight crew, secure the deck.</i>"
tt0848228,"00:33:03,390","00:33:04,968",Is this a submarine?
tt0848228,"00:33:05,518","00:33:06,513",Really?
tt0848228,"00:33:06,644","00:33:10,392","They want me in a submerged, pressurised, metal container?"
tt0848228,"00:33:36,800","00:33:39,171","No, no, this is much worse."
tt0848228,"00:34:08,999","00:34:11,704",Hover power check complete. Position cyclic.
tt0848228,"00:34:11,919","00:34:14,327",Increase collective to 8.0%.
tt0848228,"00:34:19,427","00:34:21,716",Preparing for maximum performance takeoff.
tt0848228,"00:34:21,846","00:34:23,340",Increase output to capacity.
tt0848228,"00:34:23,515","00:34:25,638",Power plant performing at capacity.
tt0848228,"00:34:25,850","00:34:27,309",We are clear.
tt0848228,"00:34:27,519","00:34:29,013",All engines operating.
tt0848228,"00:34:29,229","00:34:33,855",S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency Protocol 193.6 in effect.

tt0848228,"00:34:37,028","00:34:38,024",Let's vanish.
tt0848228,"00:34:38,238","00:34:40,645",Engage retro-reflection panels.
tt0848228,"00:34:56,424","00:34:57,586",Reflection panels engaged.
tt0848228,"00:34:58,217","00:34:59,592",Gentlemen.
tt0848228,"00:35:11,939","00:35:13,054","Doctor, thank you for coming."
tt0848228,"00:35:15,068","00:35:16,941",Thanks for asking nicely.
tt0848228,"00:35:17,153","00:35:19,775","So, how long am I staying?"
tt0848228,"00:35:19,990","00:35:21,781","Once we get our hands on the Tesseract,"
tt0848228,"00:35:21,908","00:35:23,106",you're in the wind.
tt0848228,"00:35:23,243","00:35:25,070",Where are you with that?
tt0848228,"00:35:25,287","00:35:27,029",We're sweeping every wirelessly accessible
tt0848228,"00:35:27,163","00:35:28,159",camera on the planet.
tt0848228,"00:35:28,748","00:35:30,539","Cell phones, laptops..."
tt0848228,"00:35:31,084","00:35:34,370","If it's connected to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for us."
tt0848228,"00:35:34,587","00:35:35,833",That's still not gonna find them in time.
tt0848228,"00:35:36,047","00:35:37,043",You have to narrow your field.
tt0848228,"00:35:37,257","00:35:39,214",How many spectrometers do you have access to?
tt0848228,"00:35:39,426","00:35:41,051",#NAME?
tt0848228,"00:35:41,261","00:35:42,969",Tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof
tt0848228,"00:35:43,097","00:35:44,555",and calibrate them for gamma rays.
tt0848228,"00:35:44,765","00:35:47,968","I'll rough out a tracking algorithm, basic cluster recognition."
tt0848228,"00:35:48,269","00:35:50,677",At least we could rule out a few places.
tt0848228,"00:35:50,938","00:35:52,729",Do you have somewhere for me to work?
tt0848228,"00:35:52,981","00:35:54,096","Agent Romanoff,"
tt0848228,"00:35:54,274","00:35:56,516","could you show Dr Banner to his laboratory, please?"
tt0848228,"00:35:57,653","00:35:59,895","You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys."
tt0848228,"00:36:00,447","00:36:02,239",Put it over there.
tt0848228,"00:36:04,243","00:36:06,366",Where did you find all these people?
tt0848228,"00:36:06,579","00:36:09,533","S.H.I.E.L.D. Has no shortage of enemies, Doctor."
tt0848228,"00:36:09,999","00:36:11,079",Is this the stuff you need?
tt0848228,"00:36:11,251","00:36:12,246","Yeah, iridium."
tt0848228,"00:36:12,419","00:36:15,040",It's found in meteorites. It forms anti-protons.
tt0848228,"00:36:15,255","00:36:16,880",It's very hard to get hold of.
tt0848228,"00:36:17,090","00:36:18,632",Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D. Knows you need it.
tt0848228,"00:36:18,842","00:36:20,216","Well, I didn't know."
tt0848228,"00:36:20,426","00:36:21,624",Hey!
tt0848228,"00:36:21,844","00:36:24,133",The Tesseract has shown me so much.
tt0848228,"00:36:24,597","00:36:26,507",It's more than knowledge. It's truth.
tt0848228,"00:36:26,641","00:36:27,637",I know.
tt0848228,"00:36:28,476","00:36:30,386","What did it show you, Agent Barton?"
tt0848228,"00:36:31,354","00:36:32,765",My next target.
tt0848228,"00:36:32,939","00:36:33,935",Tell me what you need.
tt0848228,"00:36:37,444","00:36:39,271",I need a distraction.
tt0848228,"00:36:40,197","00:36:41,608",And an eyeball.
tt0848228,"00:36:48,372","00:36:50,910","I mean, if it's not too much trouble."
tt0848228,"00:36:51,125","00:36:52,156","No, no. It's fine."
tt0848228,"00:36:55,212","00:36:56,790",It's a vintage set.
tt0848228,"00:36:57,006","00:36:59,295",It took me a couple of years to collect them all.
tt0848228,"00:37:01,844","00:37:02,924",Near mint.
tt0848228,"00:37:03,137","00:37:04,513","Slight foxing around the edges, but..."
tt0848228,"00:37:04,722","00:37:07,344",We got a hit. A 67% match.
tt0848228,"00:37:07,851","00:37:09,475","Wait. Cross match, 79%."
tt0848228,"00:37:10,479","00:37:11,474",Location?
tt0848228,"00:37:11,646","00:37:14,682","Stuttgart, Germany. 28 Königstrasse."
tt0848228,"00:37:14,899","00:37:16,144",He's not exactly hiding.
tt0848228,"00:37:16,359","00:37:17,474","Captain,"
tt0848228,"00:37:17,819","00:37:18,815",you're up.
tt0848228,"00:39:54,356","00:39:55,471",Kneel before me.
tt0848228,"00:39:59,944","00:40:01,225",I said
tt0848228,"00:40:03,323","00:40:05,481",kneel!
tt0848228,"00:40:14,793","00:40:18,163",Is not this simpler?
tt0848228,"00:40:19,715","00:40:22,919",Is this not your natural state?
tt0848228,"00:40:25,220","00:40:28,424","It's the unspoken truth of humanity,"
tt0848228,"00:40:28,640","00:40:31,013",that you crave subjugation.
tt0848228,"00:40:31,560","00:40:35,344",The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy
tt0848228,"00:40:35,564","00:40:38,138","in a mad scramble for power,"
tt0848228,"00:40:39,986","00:40:41,361",for identity.
tt0848228,"00:40:43,031","00:40:46,365",You were made to be ruled.
tt0848228,"00:40:46,993","00:40:48,618","In the end,"
tt0848228,"00:40:48,870","00:40:51,158",you will always kneel.
tt0848228,"00:40:58,546","00:41:00,504",Not to men like you.
tt0848228,"00:41:01,550","00:41:03,459",There are no men like me.
tt0848228,"00:41:04,344","00:41:07,215",There are always men like you.
tt0848228,"00:41:08,515","00:41:10,342","Look to your elder, people."
tt0848228,"00:41:12,561","00:41:13,972",Let him be an example.
tt0848228,"00:41:20,777","00:41:23,351","You know, the last time I was in Germany,"
tt0848228,"00:41:23,572","00:41:26,739","and saw a man standing above everybody else,"
tt0848228,"00:41:26,951","00:41:28,410",we ended up disagreeing.
tt0848228,"00:41:28,619","00:41:30,576",The soldier.
tt0848228,"00:41:32,623","00:41:33,868",The man out of time.
tt0848228,"00:41:34,459","00:41:35,704",I'm not the one who's out of time.
tt0848228,"00:41:39,214","00:41:41,752","<i>Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.</i>"
tt0848228,"00:42:02,112","00:42:03,690",Kneel.
tt0848228,"00:42:03,822","00:42:05,233",Not today!
tt0848228,"00:42:07,326","00:42:08,607",The guy's all over the place.
tt0848228,"00:42:12,122","00:42:14,447",<i>Agent Romanoff. You miss me?</i>
tt0848228,"00:42:31,184","00:42:33,260","<i>Make your move, Reindeer Games.</i>"
tt0848228,"00:42:41,319","00:42:42,778",<i>Good move.</i>
tt0848228,"00:42:44,280","00:42:45,561",Mr Stark.
tt0848228,"00:42:46,241","00:42:47,403",<i>Captain.</i>
tt0848228,"00:42:54,625","00:42:56,249",<i>Is he saying anything?</i>
tt0848228,"00:42:56,460","00:42:57,705",Not a word.
tt0848228,"00:42:58,003","00:42:59,913",<i>Just get him here. We're low on time.</i>
tt0848228,"00:43:02,967","00:43:03,963",I don't like it.
tt0848228,"00:43:04,343","00:43:06,300","What, Rock of Ages giving up so easily?"
tt0848228,"00:43:06,511","00:43:08,171",I don't remember it being that easy.
tt0848228,"00:43:08,347","00:43:09,805",This guy packs a wallop.
tt0848228,"00:43:10,015","00:43:13,598","Still, you are pretty spry for an older fellow."
tt0848228,"00:43:14,645","00:43:16,223","What's your thing, Pilates?"
tt0848228,"00:43:16,397","00:43:17,393",What?
tt0848228,"00:43:17,565","00:43:18,561",It's like calisthenics.
tt0848228,"00:43:18,691","00:43:20,731",You might have missed a couple of things
tt0848228,"00:43:20,943","00:43:22,568",doing time as a Capsicle.
tt0848228,"00:43:24,489","00:43:26,067",Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.
tt0848228,"00:43:26,282","00:43:29,153","Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you."
tt0848228,"00:43:29,536","00:43:31,114",Where's this coming from?
tt0848228,"00:43:35,208","00:43:37,781",What's the matter? Are you scared of a little lightning?
tt0848228,"00:43:38,211","00:43:40,500",I'm not overly fond of what follows.
tt0848228,"00:43:58,316","00:43:59,477",What are you doing?
tt0848228,"00:44:12,413","00:44:13,872",<i>And now there's that guy.</i>
tt0848228,"00:44:14,081","00:44:15,825",Another Asgardian?
tt0848228,"00:44:16,042","00:44:17,869",<i>- That guy's a friendly? - Doesn't matter.</i>
tt0848228,"00:44:18,086","00:44:20,659","<i>If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost.</i>"
tt0848228,"00:44:20,880","00:44:22,707","Stark, we need a plan of attack!"
tt0848228,"00:44:22,924","00:44:25,213",<i>I have a plan. Attack.</i>
tt0848228,"00:44:31,224","00:44:33,015","I'd sit this one out, Cap."
tt0848228,"00:44:33,226","00:44:34,222",I don't see how I can.
tt0848228,"00:44:34,436","00:44:37,057",These guys come from legend. They're basically gods.
tt0848228,"00:44:37,522","00:44:38,803","There's only one God, ma'am."
tt0848228,"00:44:38,940","00:44:41,313",And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.
tt0848228,"00:44:56,792","00:44:58,167",Where is the Tesseract?
tt0848228,"00:44:58,377","00:44:59,657","I missed you, too."
tt0848228,"00:44:59,878","00:45:01,547",Do I look to be in a gaming mood?
tt0848228,"00:45:02,256","00:45:03,631",You should thank me.
tt0848228,"00:45:04,091","00:45:06,131","With the Bifrost gone, how much dark energy"
tt0848228,"00:45:06,344","00:45:09,096",did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here
tt0848228,"00:45:09,305","00:45:10,681",to your precious Earth?
tt0848228,"00:45:14,811","00:45:16,092",I thought you dead.
tt0848228,"00:45:17,731","00:45:19,142",Did you mourn?
tt0848228,"00:45:19,608","00:45:21,398",We all did. Our father...
tt0848228,"00:45:21,734","00:45:24,652",Your father.
tt0848228,"00:45:26,531","00:45:29,402","He did tell you my true parentage, did he not?"
tt0848228,"00:45:31,953","00:45:34,195",We were raised together.
tt0848228,"00:45:34,414","00:45:37,036","We played together, we fought together."
tt0848228,"00:45:37,543","00:45:38,741",Do you remember none of that?
tt0848228,"00:45:38,961","00:45:40,918",I remember a shadow.
tt0848228,"00:45:42,423","00:45:45,459",Living in the shade of your greatness.
tt0848228,"00:45:46,177","00:45:48,797",I remember you tossing me into an abyss.
tt0848228,"00:45:48,929","00:45:50,922","I, who was, and should be, king!"
tt0848228,"00:45:51,139","00:45:53,216",So you take the world I love as a recompense
tt0848228,"00:45:53,350","00:45:55,177",for your imagined slights?
tt0848228,"00:45:55,394","00:45:58,479","No. The Earth is under my protection, Loki."
tt0848228,"00:45:59,899","00:46:03,434",And you're doing a marvellous job with that.
tt0848228,"00:46:03,903","00:46:05,860",The humans slaughter each other in droves
tt0848228,"00:46:05,989","00:46:07,780",while you idly fret.
tt0848228,"00:46:07,991","00:46:10,149","I mean to rule them, as why should I not?"
tt0848228,"00:46:10,368","00:46:11,911",You think yourself above them?
tt0848228,"00:46:12,996","00:46:13,992","Well, yes."
tt0848228,"00:46:14,206","00:46:16,660","Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother."
tt0848228,"00:46:17,500","00:46:18,875",A throne would suit you ill.
tt0848228,"00:46:24,090","00:46:26,842",I've seen worlds you've never known about!
tt0848228,"00:46:27,052","00:46:31,216","I have grown, Odinson, in my exile."
tt0848228,"00:46:31,598","00:46:33,556","I have seen the true power of the Tesseract,"
tt0848228,"00:46:33,684","00:46:34,763",and when I wield it...
tt0848228,"00:46:34,977","00:46:36,720",Who showed you this power?
tt0848228,"00:46:37,897","00:46:39,225",Who controls the would-be king?
tt0848228,"00:46:39,440","00:46:41,232",- I am a king! - Not here!
tt0848228,"00:46:41,442","00:46:42,722",You give up the Tesseract!
tt0848228,"00:46:42,859","00:46:45,397",You give up this poisonous dream!
tt0848228,"00:46:48,115","00:46:49,490",You come home.
tt0848228,"00:46:54,455","00:46:55,570",I don't have it.
tt0848228,"00:46:57,667","00:46:59,458",You need the Cube to bring me home.
tt0848228,"00:46:59,586","00:47:01,911","But I've sent it off, I know not where."
tt0848228,"00:47:03,048","00:47:04,875","You listen well, brother."
tt0848228,"00:47:06,843","00:47:08,041",I'm listening.
tt0848228,"00:47:17,187","00:47:18,847",Do not touch me again.
tt0848228,"00:47:19,064","00:47:20,641",Then don't take my stuff.
tt0848228,"00:47:20,857","00:47:23,099",You have no idea what you're dealing with.
tt0848228,"00:47:24,987","00:47:25,983",Shakespeare in the Park?
tt0848228,"00:47:27,364","00:47:30,484",Doth Mother know you wear-eth her drapes?
tt0848228,"00:47:30,743","00:47:33,495","This is beyond you, metal man."
tt0848228,"00:47:33,704","00:47:35,826",Loki will face Asgardian justice.
tt0848228,"00:47:36,039","00:47:39,408","He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then,"
tt0848228,"00:47:39,793","00:47:41,038",<i>stay out of the way.</i>
tt0848228,"00:47:42,588","00:47:44,212",<i>Tourist.</i>
tt0848228,"00:47:49,595","00:47:50,627",Okay.
tt0848228,"00:48:20,419","00:48:23,337",Power at 400% capacity.
tt0848228,"00:48:23,547","00:48:25,089",How about that?
tt0848228,"00:49:25,402","00:49:26,600",Hey!
tt0848228,"00:49:29,156","00:49:30,354",That's enough.
tt0848228,"00:49:34,245","00:49:35,953","Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here."
tt0848228,"00:49:36,163","00:49:38,452",I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes.
tt0848228,"00:49:38,666","00:49:41,204",Then prove it. Put that hammer down.
tt0848228,"00:49:41,336","00:49:42,331",Yeah... No.
tt0848228,"00:49:42,587","00:49:44,046",<i>Bad call. He loves his hammer.</i>
tt0848228,"00:49:45,632","00:49:47,874",You want me to put the hammer down?
tt0848228,"00:50:15,246","00:50:16,906","Are we done, here?"
tt0848228,"00:51:04,797","00:51:07,751","In case it's unclear,"
tt0848228,"00:51:08,467","00:51:10,259","if you try to escape,"
tt0848228,"00:51:11,345","00:51:13,633","if you so much as scratch that glass,"
tt0848228,"00:51:23,232","00:51:27,182","it's 30,000 feet straight down in a steel trap."
tt0848228,"00:51:27,737","00:51:29,860",You get how that works?
tt0848228,"00:51:31,908","00:51:34,530","Ant, boot."
tt0848228,"00:51:37,873","00:51:39,615",It's an impressive cage.
tt0848228,"00:51:40,541","00:51:43,163","Not built, I think, for me."
tt0848228,"00:51:43,544","00:51:45,952",Built for something a lot stronger than you.
tt0848228,"00:51:46,172","00:51:48,046","Oh, I've heard."
tt0848228,"00:51:49,050","00:51:50,213",<i>A mindless beast.</i>
tt0848228,"00:51:51,219","00:51:52,844",<i>Makes play he's still a man.</i>
tt0848228,"00:51:53,930","00:51:56,172","<i>How desperate are you,</i>"
tt0848228,"00:51:56,391","00:51:59,476",<i>that you call on such lost creatures to defend you?</i>
tt0848228,"00:51:59,687","00:52:02,012",<i>How desperate am I?</i>
tt0848228,"00:52:02,231","00:52:04,023",You threaten my world with war.
tt0848228,"00:52:04,233","00:52:06,356",You steal a force you can't hope to control.
tt0848228,"00:52:06,568","00:52:10,352","You talk about peace, and you kill because it's fun."
tt0848228,"00:52:10,572","00:52:13,573",You have made me very desperate.
tt0848228,"00:52:13,784","00:52:15,693",You might not be glad that you did.
tt0848228,"00:52:18,956","00:52:22,242",It burns you to have come so close.
tt0848228,"00:52:23,711","00:52:26,416","To have the Tesseract, to have power,"
tt0848228,"00:52:27,215","00:52:29,422",unlimited power.
tt0848228,"00:52:29,634","00:52:31,592",And for what?
tt0848228,"00:52:33,263","00:52:37,056",A warm light for all mankind to share.
tt0848228,"00:52:37,308","00:52:40,558",And then to be reminded what real power is.
tt0848228,"00:52:44,649","00:52:48,943","Well, let me know if ""real power"" wants a magazine or something."
tt0848228,"00:52:57,288","00:52:58,747","He really grows on you, doesn't he?"
tt0848228,"00:52:58,956","00:53:00,865",Loki's gonna drag this out.
tt0848228,"00:53:01,083","00:53:04,534","So, Thor, what's his play?"
tt0848228,"00:53:04,753","00:53:07,291",He has an army called the Chitauri.
tt0848228,"00:53:07,506","00:53:10,424","They're not of Asgard, nor any world known."
tt0848228,"00:53:10,843","00:53:12,919",He means to lead them against your people.
tt0848228,"00:53:13,137","00:53:14,715","They will win him the Earth,"
tt0848228,"00:53:14,847","00:53:16,639","in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract."
tt0848228,"00:53:16,849","00:53:18,593",An army
tt0848228,"00:53:18,810","00:53:20,470",from outer space.
tt0848228,"00:53:20,687","00:53:23,095","So, he's building another portal."
tt0848228,"00:53:23,315","00:53:24,643",That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.
tt0848228,"00:53:24,774","00:53:25,770",Selvig?
tt0848228,"00:53:25,942","00:53:28,267",- He's an astrophysicist. - He's a friend.
tt0848228,"00:53:28,486","00:53:30,609","Loki has him under some kind of spell,"
tt0848228,"00:53:30,780","00:53:32,274",along with one of ours.
tt0848228,"00:53:32,490","00:53:34,068",I want to know why Loki let us take him.
tt0848228,"00:53:34,200","00:53:35,481",He's not leading an army from here.
tt0848228,"00:53:35,702","00:53:37,410",I don't think we should be focusing on Loki.
tt0848228,"00:53:37,621","00:53:39,412",That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.
tt0848228,"00:53:39,539","00:53:40,820",You could smell crazy on him.
tt0848228,"00:53:41,041","00:53:42,784",Have care how you speak.
tt0848228,"00:53:43,335","00:53:45,541","Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard."
tt0848228,"00:53:45,963","00:53:47,042",And he is my brother.
tt0848228,"00:53:47,256","00:53:49,130",He killed 80 people in two days.
tt0848228,"00:53:50,009","00:53:51,005",He's adopted.
tt0848228,"00:53:51,177","00:53:53,466",I think it's about the mechanics.
tt0848228,"00:53:53,679","00:53:55,636",Iridium... What do they need the iridium for?
tt0848228,"00:53:55,847","00:53:56,843",It's a stabilising agent.
tt0848228,"00:53:57,015","00:53:58,296","I'm just saying, pick a weekend."
tt0848228,"00:53:58,433","00:53:59,976",I'll fly you to Portland.
tt0848228,"00:54:00,185","00:54:01,728",Keep love alive.
tt0848228,"00:54:01,937","00:54:03,811",It means the portal won't collapse on itself
tt0848228,"00:54:03,981","00:54:05,808",like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.
tt0848228,"00:54:06,025","00:54:09,311","No hard feelings, Point Break. You've got a mean swing."
tt0848228,"00:54:09,529","00:54:11,771","Also, it means the portal can open as wide"
tt0848228,"00:54:11,990","00:54:14,397","and stay open as long, as Loki wants."
tt0848228,"00:54:15,118","00:54:17,324",Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.
tt0848228,"00:54:19,039","00:54:20,237",<i>That man is playing Galaga.</i>
tt0848228,"00:54:21,291","00:54:24,659","He thought we wouldn't notice, but we did."
tt0848228,"00:54:26,629","00:54:28,005",How does Fury even see these?
tt0848228,"00:54:28,173","00:54:29,168",He turns.
tt0848228,"00:54:29,466","00:54:31,090",Sounds exhausting.
tt0848228,"00:54:32,177","00:54:33,339","The rest of the raw materials,"
tt0848228,"00:54:33,553","00:54:36,341",Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily.
tt0848228,"00:54:36,556","00:54:37,932",The only major component he still needs
tt0848228,"00:54:38,141","00:54:41,641",is a power source of high-energy density.
tt0848228,"00:54:41,854","00:54:45,104",Something to kick-start the Cube.
tt0848228,"00:54:45,316","00:54:48,270",When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?
tt0848228,"00:54:48,486","00:54:49,481",Last night.
tt0848228,"00:54:49,986","00:54:53,190","The packet, Selvig's notes, the extraction theory papers."
tt0848228,"00:54:53,407","00:54:54,403",Am I the only one who did the reading?
tt0848228,"00:54:54,575","00:54:57,362",Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?
tt0848228,"00:54:57,578","00:55:00,283",He would have to heat the Cube to 120-million Kelvin
tt0848228,"00:55:00,498","00:55:01,957",just to break through the Coulomb barrier.
tt0848228,"00:55:02,166","00:55:04,373",Unless Selvig has figured out how to stabilise
tt0848228,"00:55:04,585","00:55:05,700",the quantum tunnelling effect.
tt0848228,"00:55:05,920","00:55:06,916","Well, if he could do that,"
tt0848228,"00:55:07,088","00:55:09,544",he could achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet.
tt0848228,"00:55:09,758","00:55:12,165","Finally, someone who speaks English."
tt0848228,"00:55:12,385","00:55:14,343",Is that what just happened?
tt0848228,"00:55:14,554","00:55:16,546","It's good to meet you, Dr Banner."
tt0848228,"00:55:16,764","00:55:19,801",Your work on antielectron collisions is unparalleled.
tt0848228,"00:55:20,018","00:55:21,809",And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control
tt0848228,"00:55:22,020","00:55:24,059",and turn into an enormous green rage-monster.
tt0848228,"00:55:25,607","00:55:26,638",Thanks.
tt0848228,"00:55:26,858","00:55:29,349",Dr Banner is only here to track the Cube.
tt0848228,"00:55:29,569","00:55:30,850",I was hoping you might join him.
tt0848228,"00:55:31,071","00:55:32,234",I would start with that stick of his.
tt0848228,"00:55:32,364","00:55:33,395","It may be magical,"
tt0848228,"00:55:33,532","00:55:34,813",but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.
tt0848228,"00:55:34,950","00:55:37,987","I don't know about that, but it is powered by the Cube."
tt0848228,"00:55:38,287","00:55:40,031",And I would like to know how Loki used it
tt0848228,"00:55:40,247","00:55:41,825",to turn two of the sharpest men I know
tt0848228,"00:55:41,958","00:55:43,748",into his personal flying monkeys.
tt0848228,"00:55:44,126","00:55:45,668",Monkeys? I do not understand.
tt0848228,"00:55:45,794","00:55:46,790",I do.
tt0848228,"00:55:49,798","00:55:51,672",I understood that reference.
tt0848228,"00:55:52,593","00:55:53,921","Shall we play, Doctor?"
tt0848228,"00:55:54,136","00:55:55,844","This way, sir."
tt0848228,"00:56:09,820","00:56:11,396",The gamma readings are definitely consistent
tt0848228,"00:56:11,612","00:56:13,605",with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.
tt0848228,"00:56:13,990","00:56:15,614",But it's going to take weeks to process.
tt0848228,"00:56:15,825","00:56:17,023",If we bypass their mainframe
tt0848228,"00:56:17,160","00:56:18,440","and direct route to the Homer cluster,"
tt0848228,"00:56:18,661","00:56:21,746",we can clock this at around 600 teraflops.
tt0848228,"00:56:22,916","00:56:24,873",All I packed was a toothbrush.
tt0848228,"00:56:25,961","00:56:27,539","You know, you should come by Stark Tower sometime."
tt0848228,"00:56:27,755","00:56:29,794","Top ten floors, all R&D."
tt0848228,"00:56:30,132","00:56:31,591",You'd love it. It's Candy Land.
tt0848228,"00:56:31,801","00:56:34,292","Thanks, but the last time I was in New York,"
tt0848228,"00:56:34,512","00:56:37,049",I kind of broke Harlem.
tt0848228,"00:56:37,264","00:56:39,091","Well, I promise a stress-free environment."
tt0848228,"00:56:39,308","00:56:41,099","No tension, no surprises."
tt0848228,"00:56:42,603","00:56:44,097",- Hey! - Nothing?
tt0848228,"00:56:44,313","00:56:45,309",Are you nuts?
tt0848228,"00:56:45,439","00:56:46,435",Jury's out.
tt0848228,"00:56:46,565","00:56:47,680","You really have got a lid on it, haven't you?"
tt0848228,"00:56:47,817","00:56:48,812",What's your secret?
tt0848228,"00:56:48,943","00:56:50,402","Mellow jazz, bongo drums, huge bag of weed?"
tt0848228,"00:56:50,570","00:56:51,684",Is everything a joke to you?
tt0848228,"00:56:51,988","00:56:52,984",Funny things are.
tt0848228,"00:56:53,114","00:56:54,857",Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship
tt0848228,"00:56:54,991","00:56:56,236",isn't funny.
tt0848228,"00:56:56,367","00:56:57,363","No offence, Doc."
tt0848228,"00:56:57,494","00:56:58,988","It's all right, I wouldn't have come aboard"
tt0848228,"00:56:59,120","00:57:01,956",if I couldn't handle pointy things.
tt0848228,"00:57:02,082","00:57:04,654","You're tip-toeing, big man. You need to strut."
tt0848228,"00:57:04,792","00:57:06,452","And you need to focus on the problem, Mr Stark."
tt0848228,"00:57:06,586","00:57:08,080",Do you think I'm not?
tt0848228,"00:57:08,212","00:57:11,000",Why did Fury call us in? Why now? Why not before?
tt0848228,"00:57:11,132","00:57:12,876",What isn't he telling us?
tt0848228,"00:57:13,009","00:57:14,753",I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.
tt0848228,"00:57:15,387","00:57:16,632",You think Fury's hiding something?
tt0848228,"00:57:16,763","00:57:19,930","He's a spy. Captain, he's ""the"" spy."
tt0848228,"00:57:20,058","00:57:21,802",His secrets have secrets.
tt0848228,"00:57:21,935","00:57:23,430","It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?"
tt0848228,"00:57:26,023","00:57:27,815","I just want to finish my work here, and..."
tt0848228,"00:57:27,942","00:57:28,938",Doctor?
tt0848228,"00:57:34,364","00:57:36,737","""A warm light for all mankind."""
tt0848228,"00:57:36,867","00:57:38,943",Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.
tt0848228,"00:57:39,078","00:57:40,537",I heard it.
tt0848228,"00:57:40,663","00:57:42,952",I think that was meant for you.
tt0848228,"00:57:43,666","00:57:46,620","Even if Barton didn't tell Loki about the tower,"
tt0848228,"00:57:46,753","00:57:47,832",it was still all over the news.
tt0848228,"00:57:47,962","00:57:50,038","The Stark Tower? That big, ugly"
tt0848228,"00:57:51,382","00:57:52,628",building in New York?
tt0848228,"00:57:52,759","00:57:56,460","It's powered by an arc reactor, a self-sustaining energy source."
tt0848228,"00:57:56,596","00:57:59,003","That building will run itself for, what, a year?"
tt0848228,"00:57:59,140","00:58:00,967",It's just the prototype.
tt0848228,"00:58:01,100","00:58:03,058",I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.
tt0848228,"00:58:03,478","00:58:04,889",That's what he's getting at.
tt0848228,"00:58:05,021","00:58:07,595","So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. Bring him in on the Tesseract project?"
tt0848228,"00:58:07,732","00:58:09,476",What are they doing in the energy business
tt0848228,"00:58:09,609","00:58:10,938",in the first place?
tt0848228,"00:58:11,069","00:58:14,023",I should probably look into that once my decryption programme
tt0848228,"00:58:14,156","00:58:16,314",finishes breaking into all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.
tt0848228,"00:58:16,450","00:58:17,446",I'm sorry. Did you say...
tt0848228,"00:58:17,576","00:58:19,569",Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge.
tt0848228,"00:58:19,703","00:58:21,281","In a few hours, I'll know every dirty secret"
tt0848228,"00:58:21,414","00:58:22,576",S.H.I.E.L.D. Has ever tried to hide.
tt0848228,"00:58:22,707","00:58:23,702",Blueberry?
tt0848228,"00:58:23,833","00:58:25,706",Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around.
tt0848228,"00:58:25,834","00:58:28,669",An intelligence organisation that fears intelligence?
tt0848228,"00:58:28,795","00:58:30,373","Historically, not awesome."
tt0848228,"00:58:30,506","00:58:32,795",I think Loki's trying to wind us up.
tt0848228,"00:58:32,925","00:58:34,503",This is a man who means to start a war
tt0848228,"00:58:34,635","00:58:36,177","and if we don't stay focused, he'll succeed."
tt0848228,"00:58:37,471","00:58:39,927",We have orders. We should follow them.
tt0848228,"00:58:40,433","00:58:42,426",Following's not really my style.
tt0848228,"00:58:43,645","00:58:46,017","And you're all about style, aren't you?"
tt0848228,"00:58:46,147","00:58:47,179","Of the people in this room,"
tt0848228,"00:58:47,315","00:58:48,893","which one is, A, wearing a spangly outfit,"
tt0848228,"00:58:49,025","00:58:50,354","and, B, not of use?"
tt0848228,"00:58:50,485","00:58:54,814","Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you."
tt0848228,"00:58:57,533","00:58:58,565",Just find the Cube.
tt0848228,"00:59:11,507","00:59:13,416",That's the guy my dad never shut up about?
tt0848228,"00:59:13,884","00:59:16,672",I'm wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.
tt0848228,"00:59:17,513","00:59:19,221",The guy's not wrong about Loki.
tt0848228,"00:59:19,347","00:59:21,091",He does have the jump on us.
tt0848228,"00:59:21,224","00:59:23,929",What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.
tt0848228,"00:59:24,061","00:59:25,888",It's going to blow up in his face.
tt0848228,"00:59:26,021","00:59:28,310",And I'm going to be there when it does.
tt0848228,"00:59:28,607","00:59:30,766",Yeah. I'll read all about it.
tt0848228,"00:59:32,904","00:59:34,184",Or you'll be suiting up with the rest of us.
tt0848228,"00:59:35,782","00:59:39,365","You see, I don't get a suit of armour."
tt0848228,"00:59:39,494","00:59:42,828",I'm exposed. Like a nerve.
tt0848228,"00:59:42,956","00:59:44,699",It's a nightmare.
tt0848228,"00:59:44,833","00:59:47,619",I've got a cluster of shrapnel trying every second
tt0848228,"00:59:47,752","00:59:49,745",to crawl its way into my heart.
tt0848228,"00:59:49,879","00:59:51,919",This stops it.
tt0848228,"00:59:52,048","00:59:54,373","This little circle of light, it's part of me now,"
tt0848228,"00:59:55,593","00:59:57,254",not just armour.
tt0848228,"00:59:57,929","01:00:00,385",It's a terrible privilege.
tt0848228,"01:00:00,724","01:00:03,096",#NAME?
tt0848228,"01:00:03,227","01:00:04,222",It's different.
tt0848228,"01:00:04,561","01:00:07,895","Hey, I read all about your accident."
tt0848228,"01:00:08,023","01:00:11,357",That much gamma exposure should have killed you.
tt0848228,"01:00:11,485","01:00:13,940",So you're saying that the Hulk...
tt0848228,"01:00:15,405","01:00:17,778",The other guy saved my life?
tt0848228,"01:00:18,283","01:00:19,398",That's nice.
tt0848228,"01:00:20,285","01:00:24,070",It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?
tt0848228,"01:00:25,374","01:00:27,284",I guess we'll find out.
tt0848228,"01:00:29,003","01:00:30,663",You may not enjoy that.
tt0848228,"01:00:30,797","01:00:32,754",And you just might.
tt0848228,"01:01:31,985","01:01:33,360","<i>As soon as Loki took the doctor,</i>"
tt0848228,"01:01:33,487","01:01:35,229",we moved Jane Foster.
tt0848228,"01:01:35,363","01:01:37,735",They've got an excellent observatory in Tromsø.
tt0848228,"01:01:37,865","01:01:41,400",She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday.
tt0848228,"01:01:41,536","01:01:45,320","Handsome fee, private plane, very remote."
tt0848228,"01:01:46,208","01:01:47,239",She'll be safe.
tt0848228,"01:01:47,375","01:01:48,751",Thank you.
tt0848228,"01:01:50,546","01:01:52,585","It's no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig."
tt0848228,"01:01:53,590","01:01:56,164",I dread what he plans for him once he's done.
tt0848228,"01:01:56,302","01:01:57,416",Erik is a good man.
tt0848228,"01:01:57,553","01:01:58,549",He talks about you a lot.
tt0848228,"01:02:00,431","01:02:02,423",You changed his life.
tt0848228,"01:02:04,142","01:02:06,016",You changed everything around here.
tt0848228,"01:02:06,145","01:02:08,268",They were better as they were.
tt0848228,"01:02:08,856","01:02:10,932",We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced
tt0848228,"01:02:11,066","01:02:14,767","but we come here, battling like bilge snipe."
tt0848228,"01:02:14,904","01:02:16,731",#NAME?
tt0848228,"01:02:16,864","01:02:19,901","You know, huge, scaly, big antlers."

tt0848228,"01:02:22,620","01:02:24,494","Well, they are repulsive."
tt0848228,"01:02:25,832","01:02:28,074",And they trample everything in their path.

tt0848228,"01:02:39,221","01:02:41,546",and your people paid the price.
tt0848228,"01:02:41,681","01:02:43,473","And now, again."
tt0848228,"01:02:46,019","01:02:48,475","In my youth, I courted war."
tt0848228,"01:02:50,232","01:02:52,225",War hasn't started yet.
tt0848228,"01:02:53,361","01:02:55,152",You think you could make Loki tell us
tt0848228,"01:02:55,279","01:02:56,559",where the Tesseract is?
tt0848228,"01:02:56,696","01:02:59,947",I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.
tt0848228,"01:03:00,075","01:03:04,784","It's not just power he craves, it's vengeance, upon me."
tt0848228,"01:03:04,914","01:03:07,037",There's no pain would prise his need from him.
tt0848228,"01:03:08,125","01:03:10,332",A lot of guys think that
tt0848228,"01:03:10,461","01:03:11,955",until the pain starts.
tt0848228,"01:03:14,257","01:03:15,751",What are you asking me to do?
tt0848228,"01:03:15,884","01:03:19,467","I'm asking, what are you prepared to do?"
tt0848228,"01:03:19,596","01:03:20,627",Loki is a prisoner.
tt0848228,"01:03:20,764","01:03:23,088",Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat
tt0848228,"01:03:23,224","01:03:24,802",that wants to be here?
tt0848228,"01:03:37,406","01:03:40,490",There's not many people who can sneak up on me.
tt0848228,"01:03:40,617","01:03:42,278",But you figured I'd come.
tt0848228,"01:03:42,953","01:03:44,531",After.
tt0848228,"01:03:45,414","01:03:48,830","After whatever tortures Fury can concoct,"
tt0848228,"01:03:48,960","01:03:52,624","you would appear as a friend, as a balm."
tt0848228,"01:03:53,589","01:03:55,249",And I would cooperate.
tt0848228,"01:03:55,382","01:03:57,375",I want to know what you've done to Agent Barton.
tt0848228,"01:03:57,509","01:03:59,502",I would say I've expanded his mind.
tt0848228,"01:04:02,098","01:04:04,007","And once you've won,"
tt0848228,"01:04:04,892","01:04:06,173","once you're king of the mountain,"
tt0848228,"01:04:08,313","01:04:10,804",what happens to his mind?
tt0848228,"01:04:12,067","01:04:13,858","Is this love, Agent Romanoff?"
tt0848228,"01:04:13,985","01:04:16,821",Love is for children. I owe him a debt.
tt0848228,"01:04:20,700","01:04:22,574",Tell me.
tt0848228,"01:04:26,915","01:04:30,165",Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L. D... I...
tt0848228,"01:04:32,588","01:04:36,502","Well, I made a name for myself."
tt0848228,"01:04:36,634","01:04:39,635",I have a very specific skill set.
tt0848228,"01:04:39,762","01:04:43,427","I didn't care who I used it for, or on."
tt0848228,"01:04:44,433","01:04:47,932",I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar in a bad way.
tt0848228,"01:04:49,104","01:04:52,022",Agent Barton was sent to kill me.
tt0848228,"01:04:53,067","01:04:54,609",He made a different call.
tt0848228,"01:04:56,570","01:04:59,607",And what will you do if I vow to spare him?
tt0848228,"01:04:59,991","01:05:01,319",Not let you out.
tt0848228,"01:05:01,451","01:05:03,325","No, but I like this."
tt0848228,"01:05:04,245","01:05:07,662","Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man."
tt0848228,"01:05:07,791","01:05:09,867",Regimes fall every day.
tt0848228,"01:05:10,002","01:05:12,539",I tend not to weep over that. I'm Russian.
tt0848228,"01:05:12,670","01:05:13,666",Or I was.
tt0848228,"01:05:14,964","01:05:16,624",And what are you now?
tt0848228,"01:05:17,091","01:05:20,046",It's really not that complicated.
tt0848228,"01:05:20,178","01:05:24,258","I got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out."
tt0848228,"01:05:25,267","01:05:26,809",Can you?
tt0848228,"01:05:28,145","01:05:31,929",Can you wipe out that much red?
tt0848228,"01:05:33,109","01:05:34,900","Dreykov's daughter,"
tt0848228,"01:05:36,320","01:05:38,146","São Paulo,"
tt0848228,"01:05:39,197","01:05:41,689",the hospital fire?
tt0848228,"01:05:42,534","01:05:44,907",Barton told me everything.
tt0848228,"01:05:45,037","01:05:48,121",Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red
tt0848228,"01:05:48,249","01:05:50,740",and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself
tt0848228,"01:05:50,876","01:05:52,252",will change anything?
tt0848228,"01:05:52,378","01:05:55,048",This is the basest sentimentality.
tt0848228,"01:05:55,173","01:05:57,415",This is a child at prayer.
tt0848228,"01:05:57,550","01:05:58,831",Pathetic!
tt0848228,"01:05:59,636","01:06:02,209",<i>You lie and kill</i>
tt0848228,"01:06:02,347","01:06:05,383",<i>in the service of liars and killers.</i>
tt0848228,"01:06:08,478","01:06:11,645","<i>You pretend to be separate, to have your own code,</i>"
tt0848228,"01:06:11,773","01:06:14,478",<i>something that makes up for the horrors.</i>
tt0848228,"01:06:15,652","01:06:18,060",<i>But they are part of you.</i>
tt0848228,"01:06:18,196","01:06:21,981",<i>And they will never go away.</i>
tt0848228,"01:06:22,576","01:06:26,076","I won't touch Barton, not until I make him kill you."
tt0848228,"01:06:26,205","01:06:28,447","Slowly, intimately,"
tt0848228,"01:06:28,582","01:06:30,955",in every way he knows you fear.
tt0848228,"01:06:31,085","01:06:34,169",And then he'll wake just long enough to see his good work
tt0848228,"01:06:34,296","01:06:37,747","and when he screams, I'll split his skull."
tt0848228,"01:06:37,883","01:06:41,003","This is my bargain, you mewling quim."
tt0848228,"01:06:42,596","01:06:44,174",You're a monster.
tt0848228,"01:06:46,392","01:06:47,886","Oh, no."
tt0848228,"01:06:48,770","01:06:50,347",You brought the monster.
tt0848228,"01:06:53,358","01:06:54,936","So, Banner."
tt0848228,"01:06:55,986","01:06:57,148",That's your play.
tt0848228,"01:06:57,279","01:06:58,310",What?
tt0848228,"01:06:59,280","01:07:00,940",Loki means to unleash the Hulk.
tt0848228,"01:07:01,073","01:07:02,532",Keep Banner in the lab. I'm on my way.
tt0848228,"01:07:02,658","01:07:03,738",Send Thor as well.
tt0848228,"01:07:05,411","01:07:06,740",Thank you
tt0848228,"01:07:06,871","01:07:09,030",for your cooperation.
tt0848228,"01:07:16,548","01:07:18,007","What are you doing, Mr Stark?"
tt0848228,"01:07:18,133","01:07:20,625",Kind of been wondering the same thing about you.
tt0848228,"01:07:20,761","01:07:22,635",You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.
tt0848228,"01:07:22,763","01:07:24,341",We are. The model's locked
tt0848228,"01:07:24,473","01:07:25,754",and we're sweeping for the signature now.
tt0848228,"01:07:25,892","01:07:26,886","When we get a hit,"
tt0848228,"01:07:27,017","01:07:28,974",we'll have the location within half a mile.
tt0848228,"01:07:29,102","01:07:33,349","Yeah, then you get your Cube back. No muss, no fuss."
tt0848228,"01:07:33,482","01:07:34,597","What is ""Phase 2""?"
tt0848228,"01:07:36,819","01:07:39,654",Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. Uses the Cube to make weapons.
tt0848228,"01:07:39,780","01:07:41,524","Sorry, computer was moving a little slow for me."
tt0848228,"01:07:41,657","01:07:44,362","Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract."
tt0848228,"01:07:44,494","01:07:45,953",This does not mean that we're making...
tt0848228,"01:07:46,079","01:07:47,075","I'm sorry, Nick."
tt0848228,"01:07:47,205","01:07:49,494",What were you lying?
tt0848228,"01:07:49,624","01:07:50,869","I was wrong, Director."
tt0848228,"01:07:51,001","01:07:52,032",The world hasn't changed a bit.
tt0848228,"01:07:52,169","01:07:53,200",Did you know about this?
tt0848228,"01:07:53,336","01:07:54,664",You want to think about removing yourself
tt0848228,"01:07:54,795","01:07:56,124","from this environment, Doctor?"
tt0848228,"01:07:56,255","01:07:58,414",I was in Calcutta. I was pretty well removed.
tt0848228,"01:07:58,549","01:07:59,712",Loki is manipulating you.
tt0848228,"01:07:59,843","01:08:01,420","And you've been doing what, exactly?"
tt0848228,"01:08:01,553","01:08:03,213",You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.
tt0848228,"01:08:03,346","01:08:04,461","Yes, and I'm not leaving"
tt0848228,"01:08:04,598","01:08:05,878",because suddenly you get a little twitchy.
tt0848228,"01:08:06,016","01:08:07,640",I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.
tt0848228,"01:08:07,768","01:08:11,468",Is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.
tt0848228,"01:08:12,106","01:08:13,220",Because of him.
tt0848228,"01:08:14,525","01:08:15,521",Me?
tt0848228,"01:08:16,485","01:08:18,858","Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet"
tt0848228,"01:08:18,988","01:08:22,154",who had a grudge match that levelled a small town.
tt0848228,"01:08:22,282","01:08:24,489",We learned that not only are we not alone
tt0848228,"01:08:24,618","01:08:28,201","but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned."
tt0848228,"01:08:28,330","01:08:30,572",My people want nothing but peace with your planet.
tt0848228,"01:08:30,708","01:08:32,665","But you're not the only people out there, are you?"
tt0848228,"01:08:32,793","01:08:34,751",And you're not the only threat.
tt0848228,"01:08:34,879","01:08:38,046","The world's filling up with people who can't be matched,"
tt0848228,"01:08:38,716","01:08:39,915",that can't be controlled.
tt0848228,"01:08:40,051","01:08:41,166",Like you controlled the Cube?
tt0848228,"01:08:41,302","01:08:42,548",Your work with the Tesseract
tt0848228,"01:08:42,679","01:08:45,253","is what drew Loki to it, and his allies."
tt0848228,"01:08:45,390","01:08:46,766",It is a signal to all the realms
tt0848228,"01:08:46,892","01:08:49,560",that the Earth is ready for a higher form of war.
tt0848228,"01:08:49,685","01:08:50,765",A higher form?
tt0848228,"01:08:50,895","01:08:51,891",You forced our hand.
tt0848228,"01:08:52,021","01:08:53,017",We had to come up with something.
tt0848228,"01:08:53,147","01:08:54,143",A nuclear deterrent.
tt0848228,"01:08:54,274","01:08:56,266",Because that always calms everything right down.
tt0848228,"01:08:56,401","01:08:58,773","Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark."
tt0848228,"01:08:58,904","01:09:01,276","I'm sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck-deep..."
tt0848228,"01:09:01,406","01:09:03,031",Hold on. How is this now about me?
tt0848228,"01:09:03,158","01:09:04,273","I'm sorry, isn't everything?"
tt0848228,"01:09:04,409","01:09:06,283",I thought humans were more evolved than this.
tt0848228,"01:09:06,412","01:09:09,282","Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?"
tt0848228,"01:09:09,415","01:09:11,289",You treat your champions with such mistrust.
tt0848228,"01:09:11,417","01:09:12,876",Are you boys really that naïve?
tt0848228,"01:09:13,002","01:09:14,875",S.H.I.E.L.D. Monitors potential threats.
tt0848228,"01:09:15,003","01:09:16,284",Captain America's on threat watch?
tt0848228,"01:09:16,421","01:09:17,417",We all are.
tt0848228,"01:09:17,547","01:09:18,958","Wait, you're on that list?"
tt0848228,"01:09:19,091","01:09:20,633",Are you above or below angry bees?
tt0848228,"01:09:20,759","01:09:22,882","Stark, so help me God, if you make one more wisecrack..."
tt0848228,"01:09:23,012","01:09:24,257",Threat! Verbal threat. I feel threatened.
tt0848228,"01:09:24,388","01:09:26,879",#NAME?
tt0848228,"01:09:34,232","01:09:37,150","<i>Transport Six-Six-Bravo, please relay confirm codes.</i>"
tt0848228,"01:09:37,277","01:09:39,435","<i>I've got you on the computer, but not on the day log.</i>"
tt0848228,"01:09:39,571","01:09:41,646",<i>What is your haul? Over.</i>
tt0848228,"01:09:41,781","01:09:44,402",<i>Arms and ammunition. Over.</i>
tt0848228,"01:09:52,751","01:09:54,957","You speak of control, yet you court chaos."
tt0848228,"01:09:55,087","01:09:56,795","That's his M.O., isn't it?"
tt0848228,"01:09:56,922","01:09:58,167","I mean, what are we, a team?"
tt0848228,"01:09:58,298","01:10:01,253","No, we're a chemical mixture that makes chaos."
tt0848228,"01:10:01,385","01:10:03,342",We're a time bomb.
tt0848228,"01:10:03,471","01:10:05,297",You need to step away.
tt0848228,"01:10:05,431","01:10:07,258",Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?
tt0848228,"01:10:07,391","01:10:09,513",You know damn well why. Back off!
tt0848228,"01:10:09,643","01:10:11,849",I'm starting to want you to make me.
tt0848228,"01:10:11,979","01:10:15,597",Yeah. Big man in a suit of armour.
tt0848228,"01:10:15,733","01:10:17,191","Take that off, what are you?"
tt0848228,"01:10:17,318","01:10:19,643","Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist."
tt0848228,"01:10:20,529","01:10:23,696",I know guys with none of that worth ten of you.
tt0848228,"01:10:23,825","01:10:24,820",I've seen the footage.
tt0848228,"01:10:24,951","01:10:27,193",The only thing you really fight for is yourself.
tt0848228,"01:10:28,663","01:10:30,572","You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play,"
tt0848228,"01:10:30,707","01:10:33,198",to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.
tt0848228,"01:10:33,335","01:10:35,458",I think I would just cut the wire.
tt0848228,"01:10:38,089","01:10:40,295",Always a way out.
tt0848228,"01:10:40,425","01:10:41,670",You may not be a threat
tt0848228,"01:10:41,801","01:10:43,710",but you better stop pretending to be a hero.
tt0848228,"01:10:43,845","01:10:46,301",A hero? Like you?
tt0848228,"01:10:46,431","01:10:48,471","You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers."
tt0848228,"01:10:48,600","01:10:52,218",Everything special about you came out of a bottle.
tt0848228,"01:11:17,505","01:11:20,340",Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.
tt0848228,"01:11:21,342","01:11:24,794",You people are so petty and tiny.
tt0848228,"01:11:24,930","01:11:25,925","Yeah, this is a team."
tt0848228,"01:11:26,056","01:11:27,301","Agent Romanoff, would you escort"
tt0848228,"01:11:27,432","01:11:28,547",Dr Banner back to his...
tt0848228,"01:11:28,684","01:11:30,343",Where? You rented my room.
tt0848228,"01:11:30,476","01:11:31,935",The cell was just in case...
tt0848228,"01:11:32,061","01:11:33,603",In case you needed to kill me.
tt0848228,"01:11:33,730","01:11:36,647","But you can't. I know, I tried."
tt0848228,"01:11:39,361","01:11:42,278",I got low. I didn't see an end.
tt0848228,"01:11:42,405","01:11:46,867","So, I put a bullet in my mouth, and the other guy spit it out."
tt0848228,"01:11:47,453","01:11:48,651",So I moved on.
tt0848228,"01:11:48,787","01:11:51,623",I focused on helping other people. I was good.
tt0848228,"01:11:51,749","01:11:53,955",Until you dragged me back into this freak show
tt0848228,"01:11:54,085","01:11:55,460",and put everyone here at risk.
tt0848228,"01:11:55,586","01:11:57,661","You want to know my secret, Agent Romanoff?"
tt0848228,"01:11:57,796","01:11:59,623",You want to know how I stay calm?
tt0848228,"01:12:02,426","01:12:04,584","Dr Banner,"
tt0848228,"01:12:05,387","01:12:06,716",put down the sceptre.
tt0848228,"01:12:15,481","01:12:16,644",Got it.
tt0848228,"01:12:17,484","01:12:18,479","Sorry, kids,"
tt0848228,"01:12:18,610","01:12:20,353",you don't get to see my party trick after all.
tt0848228,"01:12:20,487","01:12:21,483",You located the Tesseract?
tt0848228,"01:12:21,613","01:12:22,609",I could get there fastest.
tt0848228,"01:12:22,739","01:12:24,861",The Tesseract belongs on Asgard. No human is a match for it.
tt0848228,"01:12:24,991","01:12:26,319",- You're not going alone. - You're gonna stop me?
tt0848228,"01:12:26,451","01:12:27,446","Put on the suit, let's find out."
tt0848228,"01:12:27,577","01:12:28,857",I'm not afraid to hit an old man.
tt0848228,"01:12:28,995","01:12:29,991",Put on the suit.
tt0848228,"01:12:32,874","01:12:34,499","Oh, my God."
tt0848228,"01:12:50,017","01:12:51,012",Put on the suit.
tt0848228,"01:12:51,143","01:12:52,423",Yeah.
tt0848228,"01:12:55,189","01:12:56,932",<i>All hands to stations.</i>
tt0848228,"01:13:01,070","01:13:02,861",<i>- Hill! - External detonation.</i>
tt0848228,"01:13:02,989","01:13:04,234",Number three engine is down.
tt0848228,"01:13:04,365","01:13:05,361",We've been hit.
tt0848228,"01:13:05,491","01:13:06,654",- Can they get it running? - Fire in engine three!
tt0848228,"01:13:06,784","01:13:07,780",Talk to me.
tt0848228,"01:13:07,910","01:13:09,535",Turbine looks mostly intact
tt0848228,"01:13:09,662","01:13:11,536",but it's impossible to get out there to make repairs
tt0848228,"01:13:11,664","01:13:13,075",while we're in the air.
tt0848228,"01:13:13,208","01:13:15,746","If we lose one more engine, we won't be."
tt0848228,"01:13:15,877","01:13:17,870",Somebody's got to get outside and patch that engine.
tt0848228,"01:13:18,004","01:13:19,712","<i>- Stark, you copy that? - I'm on it.</i>"
tt0848228,"01:13:19,839","01:13:23,125","<i>Coulson, initiate defensive lockdown in the detention section</i>"
tt0848228,"01:13:23,259","01:13:24,255",<i>then get to the armoury.</i>

tt0848228,"01:13:29,140","01:13:30,599",We're okay.
tt0848228,"01:13:33,186","01:13:34,432","We're okay, right?"
tt0848228,"01:13:47,034","01:13:48,232","- Keep that engine down! - Yes, sir."
tt0848228,"01:13:48,368","01:13:50,076","Detention, wait for cameras to go dark."
tt0848228,"01:13:50,204","01:13:51,995",#NAME?
tt0848228,"01:13:53,749","01:13:55,243","Let's go, Level 4."
tt0848228,"01:13:56,210","01:13:58,997",Engine three. I'll meet you there.
tt0848228,"01:14:07,180","01:14:08,343",Doctor?
tt0848228,"01:14:10,726","01:14:11,721",Bruce?
tt0848228,"01:14:12,019","01:14:15,683",You got to fight it. This is just what Loki wants.
tt0848228,"01:14:17,065","01:14:18,096",We're going to be okay. Listen to me.
tt0848228,"01:14:18,233","01:14:19,228",Are you hurt?
tt0848228,"01:14:22,529","01:14:24,735",We're going to be okay. All right?
tt0848228,"01:14:24,865","01:14:27,617","I swear on my life, I will get you out of this."
tt0848228,"01:14:27,743","01:14:29,118",You will walk away and never ever...
tt0848228,"01:14:29,244","01:14:31,320",Your life?
tt0848228,"01:14:47,847","01:14:48,842",Bruce.
tt0848228,"01:15:25,719","01:15:28,878","Bring the carrier about to a 1-8-0, heading south!"
tt0848228,"01:15:29,014","01:15:30,888",- Take us to the water! - We're flying blind.
tt0848228,"01:15:31,017","01:15:33,009",Navigation's recalibrating after the engine failure.
tt0848228,"01:15:33,144","01:15:34,886",Is the sun coming up?
tt0848228,"01:15:35,646","01:15:37,852",#NAME?
tt0848228,"01:15:37,981","01:15:39,641",Get us over water.
tt0848228,"01:15:39,775","01:15:41,851","One more turbine goes down, and we drop."
tt0848228,"01:15:44,113","01:15:45,393",Thanks.
tt0848228,"01:15:48,743","01:15:49,906",Stark!
tt0848228,"01:15:52,622","01:15:54,282","Stark, I'm here!"
tt0848228,"01:15:54,416","01:15:55,910",<i>Good.</i>
tt0848228,"01:15:57,127","01:15:59,120",<i>Let's see what we've got.</i>
tt0848228,"01:15:59,254","01:16:00,913",I got to get this superconducting coolant system
tt0848228,"01:16:01,047","01:16:02,043",back online
tt0848228,"01:16:02,173","01:16:03,632","before I can access the rotors,"
tt0848228,"01:16:03,758","01:16:05,585",work on dislodging the debris.
tt0848228,"01:16:08,138","01:16:09,680",<i>I need you to get to that engine control panel</i>
tt0848228,"01:16:09,806","01:16:13,471",<i>and tell me which relays are in overload position.</i>
tt0848228,"01:16:25,781","01:16:27,324",<i>What does it look like in there?</i>
tt0848228,"01:16:28,033","01:16:30,571",It seems to run on some form of electricity.
tt0848228,"01:16:30,702","01:16:32,446","Well, you're not wrong."
tt0848228,"01:17:36,270","01:17:39,106","We are not your enemies, Banner."
tt0848228,"01:17:39,232","01:17:40,228",Try to think!
tt0848228,"01:17:50,368","01:17:52,242","<i>Okay, the relays are intact.</i>"
tt0848228,"01:17:52,370","01:17:53,829",What's our next move?
tt0848228,"01:17:53,955","01:17:54,951","<i>Even if I clear the rotors,</i>"
tt0848228,"01:17:55,081","01:17:57,288",<i>this thing won't re-engage without a jump.</i>
tt0848228,"01:17:57,417","01:17:58,792",I'm going to have to get in there and push.
tt0848228,"01:17:58,919","01:18:00,662","If that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded."
tt0848228,"01:18:00,796","01:18:02,788",That stator control unit can reverse the polarity
tt0848228,"01:18:02,923","01:18:04,334",long enough to disengage maglev and that could...
tt0848228,"01:18:04,466","01:18:05,795",Speak English!
tt0848228,"01:18:07,136","01:18:08,250",You see that red lever?
tt0848228,"01:18:09,555","01:18:11,678",<i>It will slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out.</i>
tt0848228,"01:18:11,807","01:18:13,599",Stand by it. Wait for my word.
tt0848228,"01:19:06,197","01:19:07,988",We need full evac on the lower hangar bay.
tt0848228,"01:19:11,201","01:19:12,232",Grenade!

tt0848228,"01:19:47,739","01:19:48,735",Get his attention.
tt0848228,"01:19:48,865","01:19:53,029","Escort 6-0, proceed to Wishbone and engage hostile."
tt0848228,"01:19:53,162","01:19:54,442",<i>Don't get too close.</i>
tt0848228,"01:19:54,580","01:19:55,955",<i>Copy.</i>

tt0848228,"01:21:36,142","01:21:38,349","They're not getting through here, so what the hell..."
tt0848228,"01:21:56,747","01:21:58,989",<i>Engine one is now in shut-down.</i>
tt0848228,"01:22:07,425","01:22:09,583",We are in an uncontrolled descent.
tt0848228,"01:22:09,719","01:22:11,593","<i>Sir, we've lost all power in engine one.</i>"
tt0848228,"01:22:12,138","01:22:13,965",<i>It's Barton. He took out our systems.</i>
tt0848228,"01:22:14,099","01:22:16,590",<i>He's headed for the detention level.</i>
tt0848228,"01:22:16,726","01:22:18,684",<i>Does anybody copy?</i>
tt0848228,"01:22:19,854","01:22:21,977",This is Agent Romanoff.
tt0848228,"01:22:22,106","01:22:23,565",I copy.
tt0848228,"01:22:28,196","01:22:29,192","<i>Stark, we're losing altitude.</i>"
tt0848228,"01:22:29,322","01:22:30,781","Yeah, I noticed."
tt0848228,"01:22:59,812","01:23:00,843",No!
tt0848228,"01:23:08,446","01:23:11,151",Are you ever not going to fall for that?
tt0848228,"01:23:54,160","01:23:56,402",The humans think us immortal.
tt0848228,"01:23:57,497","01:23:59,039",Should we test that?
tt0848228,"01:24:01,835","01:24:03,033","Move away, please."
tt0848228,"01:24:07,506","01:24:09,001",You like this?
tt0848228,"01:24:09,967","01:24:13,218",We started working on the prototype after you sent the Destroyer.
tt0848228,"01:24:14,430","01:24:16,672",Even I don't know what it does.
tt0848228,"01:24:17,475","01:24:18,720",Do you want to find out?

tt0848228,"01:26:11,009","01:26:13,500",It's in your nature.
tt0848228,"01:26:15,681","01:26:18,006",Your heroes are scattered.
tt0848228,"01:26:18,142","01:26:21,843",Your floating fortress falls from the sky.

tt0848228,"01:26:24,272","01:26:26,349",You lack conviction.
tt0848228,"01:26:27,192","01:26:28,188",I don't think I'm...
tt0848228,"01:26:35,034","01:26:36,744","So, that's what it does."

tt0848228,"01:28:08,047","01:28:09,506",Just stay awake.
tt0848228,"01:28:09,632","01:28:11,256",Eyes on me.
tt0848228,"01:28:11,383","01:28:12,925","No, I'm clocking out here."
tt0848228,"01:28:13,051","01:28:14,546",Not an option.
tt0848228,"01:28:15,554","01:28:17,511","It's okay, boss."
tt0848228,"01:28:19,433","01:28:21,473",This was never gonna work

tt0848228,"01:29:27,671","01:29:29,794",I guess he never did get you to sign them.
tt0848228,"01:29:33,301","01:29:34,961",We're dead in the air up here.

tt0848228,"01:29:59,703","01:30:03,037",we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract.

tt0848228,"01:30:06,543","01:30:09,580",because I was playing something even riskier.
tt0848228,"01:30:13,551","01:30:17,679","There was an idea, Stark knows this,"
tt0848228,"01:30:19,557","01:30:22,891",called the Avengers Initiative.
tt0848228,"01:30:24,104","01:30:26,226",The idea was to bring together a group
tt0848228,"01:30:26,355","01:30:28,893",of remarkable people
tt0848228,"01:30:29,692","01:30:32,527",to see if they could become something more.
tt0848228,"01:30:33,905","01:30:38,069","To see if they could work together when we needed them to,"
tt0848228,"01:30:38,201","01:30:41,535",to fight the battles that we never could.
tt0848228,"01:30:44,291","01:30:49,119",Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea.
tt0848228,"01:30:51,465","01:30:53,126",In heroes.
tt0848228,"01:31:01,225","01:31:02,767","Well,"
tt0848228,"01:31:03,644","01:31:06,314",it's an old-fashioned notion.
tt0848228,"01:31:26,626","01:31:29,117",<i>You fell out of the sky.</i>
tt0848228,"01:31:43,144","01:31:44,638",Did I hurt anybody?
tt0848228,"01:31:44,770","01:31:47,806",There's nobody around here to get hurt.
tt0848228,"01:31:47,939","01:31:51,225","You did scare the hell out of some pigeons, though."
tt0848228,"01:31:52,069","01:31:53,100",Lucky.
tt0848228,"01:31:53,237","01:31:54,861",Or just good aim.
tt0848228,"01:31:54,989","01:31:56,566",You were awake when you fell.
tt0848228,"01:31:58,659","01:32:00,699",#NAME?
tt0848228,"01:32:00,828","01:32:02,453",Right through the ceiling.
tt0848228,"01:32:02,580","01:32:06,530",Big and green and buck-ass nude.
tt0848228,"01:32:06,668","01:32:07,782",Here.
tt0848228,"01:32:09,170","01:32:11,329",Didn't think those would fit you until you shrunk down
tt0848228,"01:32:11,464","01:32:13,872",to a regular-size feller.
tt0848228,"01:32:16,219","01:32:17,499",Thank you.
tt0848228,"01:32:18,513","01:32:19,758",Are you an alien?
tt0848228,"01:32:20,348","01:32:21,546",What?
tt0848228,"01:32:21,850","01:32:23,178","From outer space, an alien."
tt0848228,"01:32:23,810","01:32:24,806",No.
tt0848228,"01:32:25,186","01:32:28,306","Well, then, son, you've got a condition."
tt0848228,"01:32:39,160","01:32:41,484",Clint. You're going to be all right.
tt0848228,"01:32:44,831","01:32:46,908",You know that?
tt0848228,"01:32:47,751","01:32:49,625",Is that what you know?
tt0848228,"01:32:52,089","01:32:54,960",I've got no window.
tt0848228,"01:32:55,760","01:32:57,136",I have to flush him out.
tt0848228,"01:32:58,054","01:32:59,881",You got to level out. It's going to take time.
tt0848228,"01:33:00,014","01:33:01,557",You don't understand.
tt0848228,"01:33:03,518","01:33:06,768",Have you ever had someone take your brain and play?
tt0848228,"01:33:07,564","01:33:11,727",Pull you out and stuff something else in?
tt0848228,"01:33:14,904","01:33:17,277",Do you know what it's like to be unmade?
tt0848228,"01:33:18,825","01:33:21,197",You know that I do.
tt0848228,"01:33:28,794","01:33:29,825",Why am I back?
tt0848228,"01:33:30,963","01:33:32,338",How did you get him out?
tt0848228,"01:33:32,465","01:33:35,300",Cognitive recalibration.
tt0848228,"01:33:35,426","01:33:38,130",I hit you really hard on the head.
tt0848228,"01:33:38,262","01:33:39,341",Thanks.
tt0848228,"01:33:43,642","01:33:45,386",Natasha...
tt0848228,"01:33:46,062","01:33:47,141",How many agents did I...
tt0848228,"01:33:47,271","01:33:48,730",Don't.
tt0848228,"01:33:48,856","01:33:51,063","Don't do that to yourself, Clint."
tt0848228,"01:33:51,651","01:33:53,359",This is Loki.
tt0848228,"01:33:53,486","01:33:56,108","This is monsters and magic,"
tt0848228,"01:33:56,239","01:33:57,864",and nothing we were ever trained for.
tt0848228,"01:33:57,991","01:33:59,533","Loki, did he get away?"
tt0848228,"01:33:59,659","01:34:00,655",Yeah.
tt0848228,"01:34:00,994","01:34:03,235",I don't suppose you know where.
tt0848228,"01:34:03,371","01:34:05,162",I didn't need to know.
tt0848228,"01:34:05,289","01:34:07,033",I didn't ask.
tt0848228,"01:34:10,295","01:34:12,786","He's going to make his play soon, though."
tt0848228,"01:34:13,131","01:34:14,127",Today.
tt0848228,"01:34:14,257","01:34:15,586",We got to stop him.
tt0848228,"01:34:16,259","01:34:17,504","Yeah? Who's ""we""?"
tt0848228,"01:34:17,636","01:34:19,593",I don't know. Whoever's left.
tt0848228,"01:34:20,806","01:34:22,134","Well,"
tt0848228,"01:34:23,851","01:34:26,009","if I put an arrow through Loki's eye socket,"
tt0848228,"01:34:26,145","01:34:28,850","I would sleep better, I suppose."
tt0848228,"01:34:31,692","01:34:33,269",Now you sound like you.
tt0848228,"01:34:33,986","01:34:35,445",But you don't.
tt0848228,"01:34:37,364","01:34:40,200","You're a spy, not a soldier."
tt0848228,"01:34:40,326","01:34:45,071",Now you want to wade into a war. Why?
tt0848228,"01:34:46,833","01:34:48,790",What did Loki do to you?
tt0848228,"01:34:49,544","01:34:51,952",He didn't. I just...
tt0848228,"01:34:55,717","01:34:57,258",Natasha.
tt0848228,"01:34:59,345","01:35:01,338",I've been compromised.
tt0848228,"01:35:04,434","01:35:06,557",I got red in my ledger.
tt0848228,"01:35:08,688","01:35:10,765",I would like to wipe it out.
tt0848228,"01:35:26,790","01:35:28,284",Was he married?
tt0848228,"01:35:28,417","01:35:29,828",No.
tt0848228,"01:35:29,960","01:35:34,172","There was a cellist, I think."
tt0848228,"01:35:35,758","01:35:37,169",I'm sorry.
tt0848228,"01:35:37,885","01:35:39,545",He seemed like a good man.
tt0848228,"01:35:40,847","01:35:41,926",He was an idiot.
tt0848228,"01:35:42,056","01:35:44,298",Why? For believing?
tt0848228,"01:35:44,434","01:35:45,845",For taking on Loki alone.
tt0848228,"01:35:45,977","01:35:47,685",He was doing his job.
tt0848228,"01:35:47,813","01:35:50,351",He was out of his league. He should have waited.
tt0848228,"01:35:50,482","01:35:51,512",He should have...
tt0848228,"01:35:51,649","01:35:53,227","Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony."
tt0848228,"01:35:53,359","01:35:55,482","Right, I've heard that before."
tt0848228,"01:35:55,611","01:35:57,106",Is this the first time you lost a soldier?
tt0848228,"01:35:57,238","01:35:59,030",We are not soldiers.
tt0848228,"01:36:03,495","01:36:05,238",I'm not marching to Fury's fife.
tt0848228,"01:36:05,372","01:36:06,535",Neither am I.
tt0848228,"01:36:06,665","01:36:08,871",He's got the same blood on his hands that Loki does.
tt0848228,"01:36:09,001","01:36:10,376","But right now, we got to put that behind us"
tt0848228,"01:36:10,502","01:36:12,709",and get this done.
tt0848228,"01:36:12,838","01:36:13,834",Loki needs a power source.
tt0848228,"01:36:13,964","01:36:14,960",If we can put together a list...
tt0848228,"01:36:15,091","01:36:16,086",He made it personal.
tt0848228,"01:36:16,259","01:36:17,290",That's not the point.
tt0848228,"01:36:17,426","01:36:19,798",That is the point. That's Loki's point.
tt0848228,"01:36:19,928","01:36:21,837",He hit us all right where we live. Why?
tt0848228,"01:36:21,972","01:36:22,968",To tear us apart.
tt0848228,"01:36:23,098","01:36:24,972","Yeah, divide and conquer is great"
tt0848228,"01:36:25,100","01:36:27,556","but he knows he has to take us out to win, right?"
tt0848228,"01:36:27,686","01:36:29,229",That's what he wants.
tt0848228,"01:36:29,355","01:36:31,846","He wants to beat us, he wants to be seen doing it."
tt0848228,"01:36:31,983","01:36:33,097",He wants an audience.
tt0848228,"01:36:33,818","01:36:35,478",Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.
tt0848228,"01:36:35,612","01:36:38,529","Yeah, that was just previews. This is opening night."
tt0848228,"01:36:38,656","01:36:41,195","And Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?"
tt0848228,"01:36:41,326","01:36:42,904","He wants flowers, he wants parades."
tt0848228,"01:36:43,036","01:36:46,819",He wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered...
tt0848228,"01:36:48,583","01:36:50,160",Son of a bitch.
tt0848228,"01:37:01,430","01:37:02,461",Time to go.
tt0848228,"01:37:02,598","01:37:04,140",- Go where? - I'll tell you on the way.
tt0848228,"01:37:04,266","01:37:05,262",Can you fly one of those jets?
tt0848228,"01:37:06,852","01:37:08,097",I can.
tt0848228,"01:37:11,982","01:37:13,013",You got a suit?
tt0848228,"01:37:13,150","01:37:14,145",Yeah.
tt0848228,"01:37:14,276","01:37:15,735",Then suit up.
tt0848228,"01:37:43,389","01:37:44,670","Hey, you guys aren't authorised to be in here."
tt0848228,"01:37:44,807","01:37:47,133","Son, just don't."
tt0848228,"01:37:49,187","01:37:50,183",Sir.
tt0848228,"01:37:50,313","01:37:51,511",Agent Hill.
tt0848228,"01:37:52,065","01:37:53,607","Those cards,"
tt0848228,"01:37:55,736","01:38:00,197","they were in Coulson's locker, not in his jacket."
tt0848228,"01:38:04,620","01:38:06,197",They needed the push.
tt0848228,"01:38:09,291","01:38:11,580",<i>We have an unauthorised departure from Bay 6.</i>
tt0848228,"01:38:12,461","01:38:13,789",They found him.
tt0848228,"01:38:14,630","01:38:18,331","Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do."
tt0848228,"01:38:18,467","01:38:20,709",#NAME?
tt0848228,"01:38:34,275","01:38:36,018","<i>Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor</i>"
tt0848228,"01:38:36,152","01:38:39,984",<i>but the device is already self-sustaining.</i>
tt0848228,"01:38:40,114","01:38:42,273","<i>Shut it down, Dr Selvig.</i>"
tt0848228,"01:38:42,951","01:38:44,231",It's too late!
tt0848228,"01:38:46,288","01:38:47,747",She can't stop now.
tt0848228,"01:38:48,790","01:38:51,246",She wants to show us something!
tt0848228,"01:38:51,377","01:38:53,416",A new universe.
tt0848228,"01:38:53,545","01:38:55,088",<i>Okay.</i>
tt0848228,"01:39:02,137","01:39:04,011",<i>The barrier is pure energy.</i>
tt0848228,"01:39:04,139","01:39:06,013",<i>It's unbreachable.</i>
tt0848228,"01:39:06,141","01:39:07,933","<i>Yeah, I got that.</i>"
tt0848228,"01:39:09,144","01:39:10,140",<i>Plan B.</i>
tt0848228,"01:39:11,313","01:39:13,390","<i>Sir, the Mark 7 is not ready for deployment.</i>"
tt0848228,"01:39:13,524","01:39:15,766",Then skip the spinning rims. We're on the clock.
tt0848228,"01:39:35,505","01:39:38,542",Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity.
tt0848228,"01:39:39,676","01:39:42,048","Actually, I'm planning to threaten you."
tt0848228,"01:39:42,179","01:39:43,638",You should have left your armour on for that.
tt0848228,"01:39:43,764","01:39:45,175",Yeah.
tt0848228,"01:39:45,307","01:39:46,386","It's seen a bit of mileage,"
tt0848228,"01:39:46,517","01:39:49,138",and you've got the glow stick of destiny.
tt0848228,"01:39:49,937","01:39:52,226",Would you like a drink?
tt0848228,"01:39:52,356","01:39:53,471",Stalling me won't change anything.
tt0848228,"01:39:53,608","01:39:55,730","No, no. Threatening."
tt0848228,"01:39:55,859","01:39:57,234",No drink? Are you sure?
tt0848228,"01:39:57,361","01:39:58,903",I'm having one.
tt0848228,"01:39:59,947","01:40:03,861",The Chitauri are coming. Nothing will change that.
tt0848228,"01:40:04,744","01:40:06,154",What have I to fear?
tt0848228,"01:40:06,287","01:40:07,995",The Avengers.
tt0848228,"01:40:10,083","01:40:12,408",That's what we call ourselves. We're sort of like a team.
tt0848228,"01:40:12,544","01:40:14,168","""Earth's mightiest heroes""-type thing."
tt0848228,"01:40:14,295","01:40:16,169","Yes, I've met them."
tt0848228,"01:40:16,298","01:40:17,329",Yeah.
tt0848228,"01:40:17,465","01:40:18,628","It takes us a while to get any traction,"
tt0848228,"01:40:18,758","01:40:19,754",I'll give you that one.
tt0848228,"01:40:19,885","01:40:22,090","But let's do a head count, here."
tt0848228,"01:40:22,220","01:40:24,711","Your brother, the demigod,"
tt0848228,"01:40:26,432","01:40:30,015","a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend."
tt0848228,"01:40:30,145","01:40:33,312","A man with breathtaking anger-management issues,"
tt0848228,"01:40:33,440","01:40:36,524","a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella,"
tt0848228,"01:40:37,152","01:40:40,106",you've managed to piss off every single one of them.
tt0848228,"01:40:40,239","01:40:41,235",That was the plan.
tt0848228,"01:40:41,365","01:40:43,358",Not a great plan.
tt0848228,"01:40:43,492","01:40:45,532","When they come,"
tt0848228,"01:40:45,661","01:40:47,120","and they will,"
tt0848228,"01:40:47,246","01:40:48,490",they'll come for you.
tt0848228,"01:40:48,622","01:40:49,618",I have an army.
tt0848228,"01:40:49,748","01:40:50,911",We have a Hulk.
tt0848228,"01:40:51,416","01:40:52,792",I thought the beast had wandered off.
tt0848228,"01:40:52,918","01:40:54,827",You're missing the point. There is no throne.
tt0848228,"01:40:54,962","01:40:58,960",There is no version of this where you come out on top.
tt0848228,"01:40:59,091","01:41:01,417","Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us,"
tt0848228,"01:41:01,552","01:41:03,545",but it's all on you.
tt0848228,"01:41:04,347","01:41:05,426","Because if we can't protect the Earth,"
tt0848228,"01:41:05,598","01:41:08,718",you can be damn well sure we'll avenge it.
tt0848228,"01:41:10,770","01:41:13,807",How will your friends have time for me
tt0848228,"01:41:13,940","01:41:15,731",when they are so busy fighting you?
tt0848228,"01:41:23,158","01:41:24,189",This usually works.
tt0848228,"01:41:24,325","01:41:27,161","Well, performance issues, it's not uncommon."
tt0848228,"01:41:27,287","01:41:29,196",One out of five...
tt0848228,"01:41:30,666","01:41:33,580","Jarvis, anytime now."
tt0848228,"01:41:35,337","01:41:38,089",You will all fall before me.
tt0848228,"01:41:38,215","01:41:39,591",Deploy!
tt0848228,"01:41:39,717","01:41:41,128",Deploy!
tt0848228,"01:42:08,330","01:42:11,283",<i>And there's one other person you pissed off.</i>
tt0848228,"01:42:12,417","01:42:13,662",<i>His name was Phil.</i>
tt0848228,"01:42:37,442","01:42:38,937",Right.
tt0848228,"01:42:39,069","01:42:40,314",Army.
tt0848228,"01:43:52,687","01:43:53,968",Loki!
tt0848228,"01:43:54,105","01:43:56,145","Turn off the Tesseract, or I'll destroy it."
tt0848228,"01:43:56,274","01:43:57,306",You can't.
tt0848228,"01:43:57,442","01:43:59,315",There is no stopping it.
tt0848228,"01:43:59,443","01:44:01,235",There is only
tt0848228,"01:44:01,362","01:44:02,477",the war.
tt0848228,"01:44:02,613","01:44:03,728",So be it.
tt0848228,"01:44:25,846","01:44:27,589","<i>Stark, we're on your three, headed northeast.</i>"
tt0848228,"01:44:27,723","01:44:29,846",What? Did you stop for drive-through?
tt0848228,"01:44:29,975","01:44:31,683",Swing up Park. I'm going to lay them out for you.
tt0848228,"01:44:49,746","01:44:51,075","<i>Sir, we have more incoming.</i>"
tt0848228,"01:44:51,206","01:44:52,949",Fine. Let's keep them occupied.
tt0848228,"01:44:59,839","01:45:01,713",#NAME?
tt0848228,"01:45:46,053","01:45:48,260",We got to get back up there.
tt0848228,"01:46:39,609","01:46:41,269","Stark, are you seeing this?"
tt0848228,"01:46:42,028","01:46:44,483",<i>Seeing. Still working on believing.</i>
tt0848228,"01:46:44,614","01:46:45,989",Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?
tt0848228,"01:46:46,115","01:46:47,147",<i>Banner?</i>
tt0848228,"01:46:47,283","01:46:48,315",Just keep me posted.
tt0848228,"01:46:49,035","01:46:51,194","<i>Jarvis, find me a soft spot.</i>"
tt0848228,"01:46:53,457","01:46:55,330",Look at this!
tt0848228,"01:46:55,459","01:46:56,455",Look around you!
tt0848228,"01:46:57,461","01:47:01,329",You think this madness will end with your rule?
tt0848228,"01:47:01,465","01:47:02,959",It's too late.
tt0848228,"01:47:04,468","01:47:05,713",It's too late to stop it.
tt0848228,"01:47:05,845","01:47:09,711","No. We can, together."
tt0848228,"01:47:16,313","01:47:18,436",Sentiment.
tt0848228,"01:47:46,011","01:47:48,549",We've got civilians still trapped up here.
tt0848228,"01:47:49,723","01:47:50,719",Loki.
tt0848228,"01:48:02,360","01:48:04,152",They're fish in a barrel down there.
tt0848228,"01:48:09,618","01:48:11,576",We got this. It's good. Go.
tt0848228,"01:48:11,704","01:48:13,079",Do you think you can hold them off?
tt0848228,"01:48:13,205","01:48:14,201","Captain,"
tt0848228,"01:48:16,209","01:48:19,044",it would be my genuine pleasure.
tt0848228,"01:48:45,906","01:48:47,614",Just like Budapest all over again.
tt0848228,"01:48:48,242","01:48:50,733",You and I remember Budapest very differently.
tt0848228,"01:49:06,886","01:49:07,882",It's going to be an hour
tt0848228,"01:49:08,012","01:49:09,292",before they can scramble the National Guard.
tt0848228,"01:49:09,430","01:49:11,222",National Guard?
tt0848228,"01:49:12,183","01:49:13,677",Does the army know what's happening here?
tt0848228,"01:49:13,935","01:49:14,931",Do we?
tt0848228,"01:49:16,146","01:49:17,344",You need men in these buildings.
tt0848228,"01:49:17,480","01:49:18,975",There are people inside and they're going to be running
tt0848228,"01:49:19,107","01:49:20,305",right into the line of fire.
tt0848228,"01:49:20,442","01:49:22,351",You take them to the basements or through the subway.
tt0848228,"01:49:22,485","01:49:24,062",You keep them off the streets.
tt0848228,"01:49:24,195","01:49:26,816",I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.
tt0848228,"01:49:26,948","01:49:28,572",Why the hell should I take orders from you?
tt0848228,"01:49:42,631","01:49:43,829",I need men in those buildings.
tt0848228,"01:49:43,966","01:49:46,042",Lead the people down and away from the streets.
tt0848228,"01:49:46,177","01:49:48,750",We're going to set up a perimeter all the way down to 39th Street.
tt0848228,"01:49:59,148","01:50:00,726","Well, we got its attention."
tt0848228,"01:50:00,858","01:50:02,732",<i>What the hell was step two?</i>
tt0848228,"01:50:32,266","01:50:33,261",What's the story upstairs?
tt0848228,"01:50:33,392","01:50:35,301",The power surrounding the Cube is impenetrable.
tt0848228,"01:50:35,436","01:50:38,057",<i>Thor's right. We got to deal with these guys.</i>
tt0848228,"01:50:38,189","01:50:39,813",#NAME?
tt0848228,"01:50:39,940","01:50:41,221",I have unfinished business with Loki.
tt0848228,"01:50:41,776","01:50:42,807","Yeah? Well, get in line."
tt0848228,"01:50:42,944","01:50:43,938",Save it.
tt0848228,"01:50:44,069","01:50:45,397","Loki's going to keep this fight focused on us,"
tt0848228,"01:50:45,529","01:50:46,560",and that's what we need.
tt0848228,"01:50:46,697","01:50:48,357","Without him, these things could run wild."
tt0848228,"01:50:48,490","01:50:51,444",We got Stark up top. He's going to need us to...
tt0848228,"01:50:58,793","01:51:02,577","So, this all seems horrible."
tt0848228,"01:51:03,047","01:51:04,162",I've seen worse.
tt0848228,"01:51:04,716","01:51:05,712",Sorry.
tt0848228,"01:51:05,842","01:51:08,512","No, we could use a little worse."
tt0848228,"01:51:08,637","01:51:11,044","<i>- Stark, we got him. - Banner?</i>"
tt0848228,"01:51:11,180","01:51:12,425",Just like you said.
tt0848228,"01:51:12,557","01:51:15,262",Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you.
tt0848228,"01:51:21,733","01:51:23,809",I don't see how that's a party.
tt0848228,"01:51:31,660","01:51:32,656",Dr Banner.
tt0848228,"01:51:34,413","01:51:36,205",Now might be a really good time for you to get angry.
tt0848228,"01:51:37,250","01:51:39,704","That's my secret, Captain."
tt0848228,"01:51:41,420","01:51:42,665",I'm always angry.
tt0848228,"01:51:54,142","01:51:55,766",<i>Hold on!</i>
tt0848228,"01:52:25,674","01:52:27,217",Send the rest.
tt0848228,"01:52:33,974","01:52:35,219",Guys.
tt0848228,"01:52:35,350","01:52:36,548","<i>Call it, Captain.</i>"
tt0848228,"01:52:36,685","01:52:37,848","All right, listen up."
tt0848228,"01:52:37,978","01:52:40,765","Until we can close that portal, our priority is containment."
tt0848228,"01:52:40,898","01:52:42,226","Barton, I want you on that roof."
tt0848228,"01:52:42,358","01:52:44,232",Eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays.
tt0848228,"01:52:44,360","01:52:45,735","Stark, you got the perimeter."
tt0848228,"01:52:45,862","01:52:47,024","Anything gets more than three blocks out,"
tt0848228,"01:52:47,155","01:52:48,697",you turn it back or you turn it to ash.
tt0848228,"01:52:48,823","01:52:50,021",<i>- Can you give me a lift? - Right.</i>
tt0848228,"01:52:50,158","01:52:51,237","<i>Better clench up, Legolas.</i>"
tt0848228,"01:52:54,829","01:52:57,202","Thor, you got to try and bottleneck that portal."
tt0848228,"01:52:57,332","01:52:58,495",Slow them down.
tt0848228,"01:52:58,625","01:53:00,783",You got the lightning. Light the bastards up.
tt0848228,"01:53:03,087","01:53:04,712","You and me, we stay here on the ground."
tt0848228,"01:53:04,839","01:53:05,870",We keep the fighting here.
tt0848228,"01:53:06,007","01:53:07,003",And Hulk...
tt0848228,"01:53:09,719","01:53:10,799",Smash.
tt0848228,"01:54:04,401","01:54:05,515",Sir.
tt0848228,"01:54:06,570","01:54:07,566",The Council is on.
tt0848228,"01:54:12,451","01:54:15,701","Stark, you got a lot of strays sniffing your tail."
tt0848228,"01:54:17,540","01:54:19,579",I'm just trying to keep them off the streets.
tt0848228,"01:54:19,709","01:54:21,950","Well, they can't bank worth a damn."
tt0848228,"01:54:22,085","01:54:23,248",So find a tight corner.
tt0848228,"01:54:23,378","01:54:24,707",I will roger that.
tt0848228,"01:54:47,695","01:54:48,858","Oh, boy."
tt0848228,"01:54:55,870","01:54:57,495",Nice call.
tt0848228,"01:54:57,622","01:54:58,820",What else you got?
tt0848228,"01:54:58,957","01:55:01,744",<i>Thor is taking on a squadron down on Sixth.</i>
tt0848228,"01:55:01,877","01:55:04,083",And he didn't invite me.
tt0848228,"01:55:43,586","01:55:45,211","Captain, none of this is going to mean a damn thing"
tt0848228,"01:55:45,338","01:55:46,583",if we don't close that portal.
tt0848228,"01:55:46,714","01:55:48,374",Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.
tt0848228,"01:55:48,508","01:55:50,750","Well, maybe it's not about guns."
tt0848228,"01:55:52,679","01:55:54,636","If you want to get up there, you're going to need a ride."
tt0848228,"01:55:55,724","01:55:56,803",I got a ride.
tt0848228,"01:55:57,935","01:55:58,966","I could use a boost, though."
tt0848228,"01:56:01,563","01:56:02,559",Are you sure about this?
tt0848228,"01:56:03,023","01:56:05,562",Yeah. It's gonna be fun.
tt0848228,"01:56:32,596","01:56:34,470","Okay, turn, turn."
tt0848228,"01:56:34,598","01:56:36,340",Less! Less!
tt0848228,"01:57:59,059","01:58:02,013","<i>Captain, the bank on 42nd past Madison.</i>"
tt0848228,"01:58:02,146","01:58:03,889",<i>They've cornered a lot of civilians in there.</i>
tt0848228,"01:58:04,023","01:58:05,932",I'm on it.
tt0848228,"01:58:26,045","01:58:27,837",Everyone! Clear out!
tt0848228,"01:58:57,745","01:58:59,405","<i>Director Fury,</i>"
tt0848228,"01:58:59,538","01:59:01,330",<i>the Council has made a decision.</i>
tt0848228,"01:59:01,457","01:59:04,209",I recognise the Council has made a decision.
tt0848228,"01:59:04,335","01:59:05,913","But given that it's a stupid-ass decision,"
tt0848228,"01:59:06,045","01:59:07,456",I have elected to ignore it.
tt0848228,"01:59:07,588","01:59:10,922","<i>Director, you're closer than any of our subs.</i>"
tt0848228,"01:59:11,050","01:59:12,046",<i>You scramble that jet...</i>
tt0848228,"01:59:12,177","01:59:14,882","That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman."
tt0848228,"01:59:15,013","01:59:17,089","Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,"
tt0848228,"01:59:17,224","01:59:19,180",I will not order a nuclear strike
tt0848228,"01:59:19,350","01:59:20,761",against a civilian population.
tt0848228,"01:59:20,893","01:59:23,301","<i>If we don't hold them here, we lose everything.</i>"
tt0848228,"01:59:23,438","01:59:26,190","If I send that bird out, we already have."
tt0848228,"01:59:29,945","01:59:31,653",You.
tt0848228,"01:59:33,907","01:59:35,070",Hawkeye!
tt0848228,"01:59:36,535","01:59:37,531","Nat, what are you doing?"
tt0848228,"01:59:38,454","01:59:39,450",A little help?
tt0848228,"01:59:44,751","01:59:45,747",I got him.
tt0848228,"02:00:12,321","02:00:13,317",Enough!
tt0848228,"02:00:13,656","02:00:16,112","You are, all of you, beneath me!"
tt0848228,"02:00:16,242","02:00:18,994","I am a god, you dull creature."
tt0848228,"02:00:19,120","02:00:20,614",And I will not be bullied by...
tt0848228,"02:00:30,466","02:00:32,339",Puny god.
tt0848228,"02:00:40,475","02:00:41,934",The sceptre...
tt0848228,"02:00:43,103","02:00:44,301",Doctor.
tt0848228,"02:00:46,190","02:00:49,025",Loki's sceptre. The energy.
tt0848228,"02:00:49,151","02:00:50,811","The Tesseract can't fight,"
tt0848228,"02:00:50,945","02:00:52,984",but you can't protect against yourself.
tt0848228,"02:00:53,114","02:00:54,110",It's not your fault.
tt0848228,"02:00:54,240","02:00:55,485",You didn't know what you were doing.
tt0848228,"02:00:58,536","02:01:00,695","Actually, I think I did."
tt0848228,"02:01:00,830","02:01:03,785",I built in a safety to cut their power source.
tt0848228,"02:01:05,001","02:01:06,411",Loki's sceptre.
tt0848228,"02:01:06,544","02:01:09,117",It may be able to close the portal.
tt0848228,"02:01:11,215","02:01:13,374",And I'm looking right at it.
tt0848228,"02:01:25,356","02:01:29,223","<i>Sir, we will lose power before we penetrate that shell.</i>"
tt0848228,"02:01:35,866","02:01:39,152","Jarvis, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?"

tt0848228,"02:02:58,826","02:03:00,903","Sir, we have a bird in motion!"
tt0848228,"02:03:01,412","02:03:03,405","Anyone on the deck, we have a rogue bird."
tt0848228,"02:03:03,540","02:03:04,820",We need to shut it down!
tt0848228,"02:03:04,958","02:03:07,164","Repeat, takeoff is not authorised."
tt0848228,"02:03:37,700","02:03:39,859","Stark, do you hear me?"
tt0848228,"02:03:39,994","02:03:42,117",You have a missile headed straight for the city.
tt0848228,"02:03:42,664","02:03:44,039",<i>How long?</i>
tt0848228,"02:03:44,165","02:03:46,242","<i>Three minutes, max.</i>"
tt0848228,"02:03:46,376","02:03:48,001",<i>The payload will wipe out Midtown.</i>
tt0848228,"02:03:48,128","02:03:50,167","Jarvis, put everything we got into the thrusters."
tt0848228,"02:03:50,296","02:03:51,956",<i>I just did.</i>
tt0848228,"02:04:04,853","02:04:06,182",<i>Package is sent.</i>
tt0848228,"02:04:06,313","02:04:09,433","<i>Detonation in 2 minutes, 30 seconds, mark.</i>"
tt0848228,"02:04:32,215","02:04:34,587",Are you ready for another bout?
tt0848228,"02:04:35,260","02:04:36,291","What, are you getting sleepy?"
tt0848228,"02:04:41,892","02:04:43,634",Right at the crown!
tt0848228,"02:04:49,649","02:04:51,441",I can close it.
tt0848228,"02:04:51,568","02:04:53,607",Can anybody copy?
tt0848228,"02:04:53,737","02:04:54,851",I can shut the portal down.
tt0848228,"02:04:54,988","02:04:57,028","<i>- Do it! - No, wait.</i>"
tt0848228,"02:04:57,157","02:04:58,402","Stark, these things are still coming."
tt0848228,"02:04:58,534","02:04:59,529",I got a nuke coming in.
tt0848228,"02:04:59,660","02:05:01,569",It's gonna blow in less than a minute.
tt0848228,"02:05:11,254","02:05:13,081",And I know just where to put it.
tt0848228,"02:05:20,264","02:05:22,636","<i>Stark, you know that's a one-way trip.</i>"
tt0848228,"02:05:22,767","02:05:24,142","Save the rest for the turn, J."
tt0848228,"02:05:24,268","02:05:28,349","<i>Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?</i>"
tt0848228,"02:05:28,481","02:05:30,521",Might as well.
tt0848228,"02:05:32,444","02:05:34,816",<i>The streets of New York City have become a battleground.</i>
tt0848228,"02:05:34,946","02:05:37,650",<i>The Army is here trying to contain the violence</i>

tt0848228,"02:05:41,786","02:05:44,704",<i>I have never seen anything like this.</i>
tt0848228,"02:05:44,831","02:05:46,325",<i>We have limited information on the team</i>
tt0848228,"02:05:46,458","02:05:50,206",<i>but we do know that billionaire Tony Stark's Iron Man...</i>
tt0848228,"02:07:03,537","02:07:05,364","Come on, Stark."
tt0848228,"02:07:12,004","02:07:13,119",Close it.
tt0848228,"02:07:33,193","02:07:34,189",Son of a gun.
tt0848228,"02:07:38,949","02:07:40,573",He's not slowing down.
tt0848228,"02:07:58,635","02:08:00,094",Is he breathing?
tt0848228,"02:08:27,957","02:08:29,368",What the hell?
tt0848228,"02:08:32,087","02:08:34,210",What just happened?
tt0848228,"02:08:34,339","02:08:36,628",Please tell me nobody kissed me.
tt0848228,"02:08:40,930","02:08:42,590",We won.
tt0848228,"02:08:44,934","02:08:46,213","All right, yay!"
tt0848228,"02:08:46,351","02:08:48,308","Hurray. Good job, guys."
tt0848228,"02:08:48,437","02:08:51,640",Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day.
tt0848228,"02:08:52,524","02:08:54,102",Have you ever tried shawarma?
tt0848228,"02:08:54,527","02:08:56,815",There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here.
tt0848228,"02:08:56,946","02:08:58,606","I don't know what it is, but I want to try it."
tt0848228,"02:08:59,031","02:09:00,490",We're not finished yet.
tt0848228,"02:09:05,455","02:09:07,578",And then shawarma after.
tt0848228,"02:09:29,229","02:09:31,471","If it's all the same to you,"
tt0848228,"02:09:34,777","02:09:36,437",I'll have that drink now.
tt0848228,"02:09:44,328","02:09:46,367",<i>Despite the devastation of what has been confirmed</i>
tt0848228,"02:09:46,497","02:09:48,205","<i>as an extraterrestrial attack,</i>"
tt0848228,"02:09:48,332","02:09:49,874",<i>the extraordinary heroics</i>

tt0848228,"02:09:52,086","02:09:53,628","<i>has been to many a cause not only for comfort,</i>"
tt0848228,"02:09:53,754","02:09:54,750",<i>but for celebration.</i>
tt0848228,"02:09:54,881","02:09:57,288",<i>It's just really great knowing they're out there.</i>
tt0848228,"02:09:57,425","02:09:59,216",<i>That someone is watching over us.</i>
tt0848228,"02:09:59,344","02:10:00,542","<i>I love you, Thor!</i>"
tt0848228,"02:10:00,678","02:10:02,387",<i>And then these guys were like...</i>
tt0848228,"02:10:02,514","02:10:03,842",<i>And then the air goes...</i>
tt0848228,"02:10:03,974","02:10:05,349",<i>And this green guy walks up and he goes...</i>
tt0848228,"02:10:05,475","02:10:06,507",<i>I don't know.</i>
tt0848228,"02:10:06,643","02:10:09,098",<i>I don't exactly feel safer with those things out there.</i>
tt0848228,"02:10:09,228","02:10:12,313",<i>It just seems that there's a lot they're not telling us.</i>
tt0848228,"02:10:12,440","02:10:15,856",<i>Superheroes in New York? Give me a break.</i>
tt0848228,"02:10:15,985","02:10:17,895","<i>These so-called ""heroes""</i>"
tt0848228,"02:10:18,029","02:10:19,310",<i>have to be held responsible</i>
tt0848228,"02:10:19,448","02:10:21,606",<i>for the destruction done to this city.</i>
tt0848228,"02:10:21,742","02:10:23,865",<i>This was their fight. Where are they now?</i>
tt0848228,"02:10:23,994","02:10:26,820",<i>Tough questions are being asked about the Avengers themselves.</i>
tt0848228,"02:10:26,956","02:10:27,951",<i>Their sudden appearance</i>
tt0848228,"02:10:28,082","02:10:29,457",<i>and equally sudden disappearance...</i>
tt0848228,"02:10:29,583","02:10:32,371","<i>What, this is all somehow their fault?</i>"
tt0848228,"02:10:34,421","02:10:37,588",<i>Captain America saved my life.</i>
tt0848228,"02:10:39,718","02:10:43,218","<i>Wherever he is, and wherever any of them are,</i>"
tt0848228,"02:10:43,347","02:10:44,841",<i>I would just...</i>
tt0848228,"02:10:45,641","02:10:47,930",<i>I would want to say thank you.</i>
tt0848228,"02:10:50,396","02:10:51,891",<i>Where are the Avengers?</i>
tt0848228,"02:10:52,023","02:10:54,431",I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts.
tt0848228,"02:10:54,567","02:10:56,726",I'd say they've earned a leave of absence.
tt0848228,"02:10:56,861","02:10:58,439",<i>And the Tesseract?</i>
tt0848228,"02:10:58,572","02:11:00,814",<i>The Tesseract is where it belongs.</i>
tt0848228,"02:11:01,240","02:11:03,566",<i>Out of our reach.</i>
tt0848228,"02:11:03,701","02:11:05,243",<i>That's not your call.</i>
tt0848228,"02:11:05,370","02:11:06,401",I didn't make it.
tt0848228,"02:11:06,537","02:11:08,779",I just didn't argue with the god that did.
tt0848228,"02:11:08,915","02:11:10,706","<i>So, you let him take it</i>"
tt0848228,"02:11:10,834","02:11:12,458","<i>and the war criminal, Loki,</i>"
tt0848228,"02:11:12,586","02:11:14,294",<i>who should be answering for his crime.</i>
tt0848228,"02:11:14,421","02:11:16,994",<i>I think he will be.</i>
tt0848228,"02:11:30,479","02:11:33,148","<i>I don't think you understand what you've started,</i>"
tt0848228,"02:11:33,273","02:11:35,729",<i>letting the Avengers loose on this world.</i>
tt0848228,"02:11:36,277","02:11:37,272",<i>They're dangerous.</i>
tt0848228,"02:11:37,403","02:11:41,068","<i>They surely are, and the whole world knows it.</i>"
tt0848228,"02:11:41,616","02:11:44,189",Every world knows it.
tt0848228,"02:11:44,619","02:11:46,695",<i>Was that the point of all this?</i>
tt0848228,"02:11:46,829","02:11:48,573",<i>A statement?</i>
tt0848228,"02:11:51,293","02:11:52,751",<i>A promise.</i>
tt0848228,"02:12:01,469","02:12:03,011","<i>Sir, how does it work now?</i>"
tt0848228,"02:12:04,139","02:12:06,131",They've gone their separate ways.
tt0848228,"02:12:06,266","02:12:09,184","Some, pretty extremely far."
tt0848228,"02:12:09,936","02:12:11,846","If we get into a situation like this again,"
tt0848228,"02:12:11,980","02:12:13,523",what happens then?
tt0848228,"02:12:13,649","02:12:14,645",They'll come back.
tt0848228,"02:12:16,151","02:12:17,860",Are you really sure about that?
tt0848228,"02:12:17,987","02:12:18,983",I am.
tt0848228,"02:12:20,615","02:12:21,813",Why?
tt0848228,"02:12:22,866","02:12:25,072",Because we'll need them to.
tt0848228,"02:15:16,671","02:15:19,162",Humans.
tt0848228,"02:15:20,466","02:15:24,796",They are not the cowering wretches we were promised.
tt0848228,"02:15:25,764","02:15:27,922",They stand.
tt0848228,"02:15:28,767","02:15:35,220","They are unruly, and therefore cannot be ruled."
tt0848228,"02:15:42,197","02:15:45,068",To challenge them
tt0848228,"02:15:45,200","02:15:48,901",is to court death.
tt0468569,"00:01:45,089","00:01:47,924","Three of a kind, let's do this. that's it? three guys?"
tt0468569,"00:01:48,092","00:01:51,426",Two guys on the roof. every guy gets a share. five shares is plenty.
tt0468569,"00:01:51,596","00:01:54,051",Six shares. don't forget the guy who planned the job.
tt0468569,"00:01:54,223","00:01:56,512",He thinks he can sit it out and still take a slice.
tt0468569,"00:01:56,684","00:01:59,804",#NAME?
tt0468569,"00:01:59,979","00:02:01,806",I heard he wears makeup. makeup?
tt0468569,"00:02:01,981","00:02:03,938","Yeah, to scare people. you know, war paint."
tt0468569,"00:02:16,496","00:02:19,699","All right, everybody, hands up, heads down!"
tt0468569,"00:02:20,083","00:02:22,870","I said, hands up, heads down!"
tt0468569,"00:02:23,044","00:02:25,998","Let's go, pal, I'm making a withdrawal here."
tt0468569,"00:02:26,255","00:02:27,714","- I said, hands up! - no!"
tt0468569,"00:02:28,091","00:02:30,332",Here comes the silent alarm.
tt0468569,"00:02:30,510","00:02:31,838",And there it goes.
tt0468569,"00:02:32,011","00:02:33,209",Heads down!
tt0468569,"00:02:33,388","00:02:35,713","All right, tootsie, you're taking a dive with me."
tt0468569,"00:02:35,890","00:02:38,559","- down! I said, stay down there! don't hurt me!"
tt0468569,"00:02:38,810","00:02:41,811","Funny, it didn't dial 911. it was trying to reach a private number."
tt0468569,"00:02:41,979","00:02:43,889","Is it a problem? no, I'm done here."
tt0468569,"00:02:53,282","00:02:55,655",Sit down! down!
tt0468569,"00:02:56,160","00:02:58,319","Down! I said, stay down there!"
tt0468569,"00:03:02,583","00:03:05,419",Obviously we don't want you doing anything with your hands...
tt0468569,"00:03:05,586","00:03:08,504",...other than holding on for dear life.
tt0468569,"00:03:16,264","00:03:18,256",On the ground! stay on the ground!
tt0468569,"00:03:18,433","00:03:22,098",Nobody make a move! nobody! stay down!
tt0468569,"00:03:42,415","00:03:44,491",You have any idea who you're stealing from?
tt0468569,"00:03:44,667","00:03:48,368","- you and your friends are dead. he's out, right?"
tt0468569,"00:03:51,466","00:03:52,711",What...?
tt0468569,"00:04:00,558","00:04:02,301",Where did you learn to count?
tt0468569,"00:04:05,104","00:04:07,144",They wired this thing up with like 5000 volts.
tt0468569,"00:04:07,315","00:04:08,560",What kind of bank does that?
tt0468569,"00:04:08,733","00:04:11,769",A mob bank. I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.
tt0468569,"00:04:11,944","00:04:12,976",Where's the alarm guy?
tt0468569,"00:04:13,154","00:04:15,645","Boss told me when the guy was done, I should take him out."
tt0468569,"00:04:15,823","00:04:17,152","One less share, right?"
tt0468569,"00:04:18,076","00:04:20,317","Funny, he told me something similar."
tt0468569,"00:04:20,495","00:04:21,953",He what? no! no!
tt0468569,"00:04:33,675","00:04:35,050",That's a lot of money.
tt0468569,"00:04:35,218","00:04:38,918","If this Joker guy was so smart, he'd have had us bring a bigger car."
tt0468569,"00:04:40,348","00:04:44,262",I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me soon as we loaded the cash.
tt0468569,"00:04:45,186","00:04:48,970","No, no, no, I kill the bus driver."
tt0468569,"00:04:49,691","00:04:50,805",Bus driver?
tt0468569,"00:04:53,027","00:04:54,521",What bus driver?
tt0468569,"00:04:58,616","00:05:00,525",School's out. time to go.
tt0468569,"00:05:00,702","00:05:02,943","That guy's not getting up, is he?"
tt0468569,"00:05:03,705","00:05:05,365",That's a lot of money.
tt0468569,"00:05:08,876","00:05:11,202",What happened to the rest of the guys?
tt0468569,"00:05:17,969","00:05:20,341","You think you're smart, huh?"
tt0468569,"00:05:21,055","00:05:22,680",The guy that hired youse...
tt0468569,"00:05:23,224","00:05:25,797",...he'll just do the Same to you.
tt0468569,"00:05:26,102","00:05:29,056","Oh, criminals in this town used to believe in things."
tt0468569,"00:05:29,230","00:05:30,511",Honor...
tt0468569,"00:05:30,690","00:05:32,398",...respect.
tt0468569,"00:05:32,567","00:05:34,892","Look at you. what do you believe in, huh?"
tt0468569,"00:05:35,069","00:05:36,350",What do you believe in?!

tt0468569,"00:18:32,347","00:18:33,889",Do them again.
tt0468569,"00:18:34,057","00:18:37,141","Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out, now, would we?"
tt0468569,"00:18:39,854","00:18:41,479",Another long night?
tt0468569,"00:18:41,647","00:18:44,601","This joint venture was your idea, and the consultants love it."
tt0468569,"00:18:45,276","00:18:46,521",But I'm not convinced.
tt0468569,"00:18:46,694","00:18:50,359",Lau's company has grown by 8 percent annually like clockwork.
tt0468569,"00:18:50,531","00:18:52,939",His revenue stream must be off the books...
tt0468569,"00:18:53,117","00:18:54,528",...maybe even illegal.
tt0468569,"00:18:54,702","00:18:56,362",Okay. cancel the deal.
tt0468569,"00:18:57,705","00:18:58,868",You already knew.
tt0468569,"00:18:59,582","00:19:02,120",Just needed a closer look at their books.
tt0468569,"00:19:02,293","00:19:04,333",Anything else you can trouble me for?
tt0468569,"00:19:04,796","00:19:06,338",I need a new suit.
tt0468569,"00:19:06,506","00:19:08,997","Yeah. three buttons is a little '90s, mr. Wayne."
tt0468569,"00:19:09,175","00:19:12,295","I'm not talking fashion, mr. Fox, so much as function."
tt0468569,"00:19:13,346","00:19:15,054",You wanna be able to turn your head.
tt0468569,"00:19:15,223","00:19:17,299",Sure make backing out of the driveway easier.
tt0468569,"00:19:17,767","00:19:19,309",I'll see what I can do.
tt0468569,"00:19:24,065","00:19:26,022",Took three weeks to get a reservation here.
tt0468569,"00:19:26,192","00:19:28,315",I had to tell them I work for the government.
tt0468569,"00:19:28,486","00:19:29,731",- really? - health inspector's...
tt0468569,"00:19:29,904","00:19:31,149",...not afraid to pull strings.
tt0468569,"00:19:31,322","00:19:33,529",Rachel. fancy that.
tt0468569,"00:19:33,700","00:19:36,191","Yeah, Bruce. fancy that."
tt0468569,"00:19:36,536","00:19:38,694","Rachel, natascha. natascha, Rachel."
tt0468569,"00:19:38,871","00:19:44,245",#NAME?
tt0468569,"00:19:44,419","00:19:47,752",- wow. Harvey's taking me next week. - really? so you're into ballet?
tt0468569,"00:19:48,089","00:19:50,247",Bruce. this is Harvey Dent.
tt0468569,"00:19:50,591","00:19:54,340",The famous Bruce Wayne. Rachel's told me everything about you.
tt0468569,"00:19:54,512","00:19:55,710",I certainly hope not.
tt0468569,"00:19:56,055","00:19:59,389",- let's put a couple tables together. - I'm not sure that they'll let us.
tt0468569,"00:19:59,559","00:20:02,595","Oh, they should. I own the place."
tt0468569,"00:20:03,062","00:20:06,016",How could you want to raise children in a city like this?
tt0468569,"00:20:06,190","00:20:08,148","Well, I was raised here. I turned out okay."
tt0468569,"00:20:08,317","00:20:09,895",Is Wayne manor in the city limits?
tt0468569,"00:20:11,738","00:20:13,280",The palisades? sure.
tt0468569,"00:20:13,448","00:20:15,903","You know, as our new da, you might wanna figure out..."
tt0468569,"00:20:16,075","00:20:17,902",...where your jurisdiction ends.
tt0468569,"00:20:18,077","00:20:22,027",I'm talking about the kind of city that idolizes a masked vigilante.
tt0468569,"00:20:22,206","00:20:25,575",Gotham city is proud of an ordinary citizen standing up for what's right.
tt0468569,"00:20:25,752","00:20:27,993","Gotham needs heroes like you, elected officials..."
tt0468569,"00:20:28,171","00:20:30,128",...not a man who thinks he's above the law.
tt0468569,"00:20:30,298","00:20:31,460",Who appointed the batman?
tt0468569,"00:20:31,632","00:20:35,464",We did. all of us who stood by and let scum take control of our city.
tt0468569,"00:20:35,636","00:20:37,380","But this is a democracy, Harvey."
tt0468569,"00:20:37,555","00:20:39,298",When their enemies were at the gates...
tt0468569,"00:20:39,474","00:20:41,229",...the romans would suspend democracy
tt0468569,"00:20:41,230","00:20:43,174",And appoint one man to protect the city
tt0468569,"00:20:43,353","00:20:45,926","It wasn't considered an honor, it was a public service."
tt0468569,"00:20:46,105","00:20:47,765","Harvey, the last man that they appointed..."
tt0468569,"00:20:47,940","00:20:50,229",...to protect the republic was named caesar...
tt0468569,"00:20:50,401","00:20:53,817","...and he never gave up his power. - okay, fine."
tt0468569,"00:20:53,988","00:20:55,317",You either die a hero...
tt0468569,"00:20:55,490","00:20:58,526",...or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
tt0468569,"00:20:58,701","00:21:02,201","Whoever the batman is, he doesn't wanna do this for the rest of his life."
tt0468569,"00:21:02,372","00:21:05,622",How could he? batman is looking for someone to take up his mantle.
tt0468569,"00:21:05,792","00:21:08,080","Someone like you, mr. Dent?"
tt0468569,"00:21:08,544","00:21:11,000",Maybe. if I'm up to it.
tt0468569,"00:21:11,172","00:21:16,415",What if Harvey Dent is the caped crusader? hm?
tt0468569,"00:21:18,680","00:21:21,846","If I were sneaking out every night, someone would've noticed by now."
tt0468569,"00:21:24,227","00:21:28,355","Well, I'm sold, Dent, and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser."
tt0468569,"00:21:28,523","00:21:31,358","That's nice, but I'm not up for reelection for three years."
tt0468569,"00:21:31,526","00:21:33,435","No, you don't understand."
tt0468569,"00:21:33,611","00:21:36,398",One fundraiser with my pals...
tt0468569,"00:21:37,031","00:21:39,154",...you'll never need another cent.
tt0468569,"00:21:53,881","00:21:56,004",What the hell is this?
tt0468569,"00:21:57,343","00:22:00,463","As you're all aware, one of our deposits was stolen."
tt0468569,"00:22:00,638","00:22:04,007","A relatively small amount, 68 million."
tt0468569,"00:22:04,183","00:22:06,721",Who's stupid enough to steal from us?
tt0468569,"00:22:07,061","00:22:10,596","Two-bit wackjob, wears a cheap purple suit and makeup."
tt0468569,"00:22:10,773","00:22:12,730",He's not the problem. he's a nobody.
tt0468569,"00:22:12,900","00:22:16,269",The problem is our money being tracked by the cops.
tt0468569,"00:22:16,446","00:22:18,937",Thanks to mr. Maroni's well-placed sources...
tt0468569,"00:22:19,115","00:22:20,812",... we know that police have indeed
tt0468569,"00:22:20,814","00:22:22,899",Identified our banks using marked bills..
tt0468569,"00:22:23,077","00:22:25,568",... and are planning to seize your funds today.
tt0468569,"00:22:25,747","00:22:27,645",And since the enthusiastic new d a has
tt0468569,"00:22:27,646","00:22:29,744",Put all my competitors out of business..
tt0468569,"00:22:30,376","00:22:33,876","...i'm your only option. so, what are you proposing?"
tt0468569,"00:22:34,047","00:22:37,712","Moving all deposits to one secure location, not a bank."
tt0468569,"00:22:37,884","00:22:39,841",#NAME?
tt0468569,"00:22:40,595","00:22:43,346",If the police were to gain leverage over one of you...
tt0468569,"00:22:43,514","00:22:45,306",... everyone's money would be at stake.
tt0468569,"00:22:45,475","00:22:47,598",What stop them getting to you?
tt0468569,"00:22:47,769","00:22:50,853","I go to hong kong, far from Dent's jurisdiction..."
tt0468569,"00:22:51,230","00:22:54,101",... and the chinese will not extradite one of their own.
tt0468569,"00:22:54,275","00:22:55,900",How soon can you move the money?
tt0468569,"00:22:56,194","00:22:57,273",I already have.
tt0468569,"00:22:59,655","00:23:02,277","For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait for your permission."
tt0468569,"00:23:02,909","00:23:06,574","Rest assured, your money is safe."
tt0468569,"00:23:18,925","00:23:21,167",And I thought my jokes were bad.
tt0468569,"00:23:21,344","00:23:24,428",Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my boy pull your head off.
tt0468569,"00:23:24,597","00:23:25,878",How about a magic trick?
tt0468569,"00:23:29,227","00:23:31,552",I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.
tt0468569,"00:23:33,856","00:23:34,971",Ta-da!
tt0468569,"00:23:35,149","00:23:36,644",It's...
tt0468569,"00:23:36,818","00:23:39,106",It's gone.
tt0468569,"00:23:39,487","00:23:41,812","Oh, and by the way, the suit, it wasn't cheap."
tt0468569,"00:23:41,989","00:23:44,825",#NAME?
tt0468569,"00:23:45,910","00:23:48,946",I want to hear proposition.
tt0468569,"00:23:51,666","00:23:54,157",Let's wind the clocks back a year.
tt0468569,"00:23:54,502","00:24:00,172",These cops and lawyers wouldn't dare cross any of you.
tt0468569,"00:24:01,342","00:24:03,465","I mean, what happened?"
tt0468569,"00:24:03,636","00:24:07,420",Did your balls drop off? hm?
tt0468569,"00:24:07,598","00:24:09,638","You see, a guy like me..."
tt0468569,"00:24:10,101","00:24:12,853",#NAME?
tt0468569,"00:24:13,021","00:24:16,140","A guy like me... look, listen."
tt0468569,"00:24:16,691","00:24:20,985","I know why you choose to have your little, ahem..."
tt0468569,"00:24:21,154","00:24:23,858",...group-therapy sessions in broad daylight.
tt0468569,"00:24:24,365","00:24:27,152",I know why you're afraid to go out at night.
tt0468569,"00:24:29,370","00:24:31,030",The batman.
tt0468569,"00:24:31,205","00:24:36,448","See, batman has shown Gotham your true colors, unfortunately."
tt0468569,"00:24:36,627","00:24:40,127","Dent, he's just the beginning."
tt0468569,"00:24:40,715","00:24:45,460",And as for the television's so-called plan...
tt0468569,"00:24:45,928","00:24:47,802",...batman has no jurisdiction.
tt0468569,"00:24:47,972","00:24:50,546",He'll find him and make him squeal.
tt0468569,"00:24:50,725","00:24:53,726",I know the squealers when I see them...
tt0468569,"00:24:56,314","00:24:57,808",What do you propose?
tt0468569,"00:24:57,982","00:25:00,390","It's simple. we, uh, kill the batman."
tt0468569,"00:25:01,736","00:25:04,690","If it's so simple, why haven't you done it already?"
tt0468569,"00:25:04,864","00:25:07,569","If you're good at something, never do it for free."
tt0468569,"00:25:08,242","00:25:09,523",How much you want?
tt0468569,"00:25:10,244","00:25:12,237","Uh, half."
tt0468569,"00:25:14,457","00:25:17,209","You're crazy. - no, I'm not."
tt0468569,"00:25:17,377","00:25:19,499","No, I'm not."
tt0468569,"00:25:21,089","00:25:24,505",If we don't deal with this now...
tt0468569,"00:25:24,676","00:25:26,300",...soon...
tt0468569,"00:25:26,511","00:25:31,422",...little Gambol here won't be able to get a nickel for his grandma.
tt0468569,"00:25:32,100","00:25:33,558",Enough from the clown!
tt0468569,"00:25:33,726","00:25:36,680","Ah, ta-ta-ta. let's not blow..."
tt0468569,"00:25:36,854","00:25:39,392",Shit! ...this out of proportion.
tt0468569,"00:25:39,565","00:25:42,056",You think you can steal from us and just walk away?
tt0468569,"00:25:42,235","00:25:43,777",- yeah. I'm putting the word out.
tt0468569,"00:25:43,945","00:25:46,234",Five hundred grand for this clown dead.
tt0468569,"00:25:46,406","00:25:49,442","A million alive, so I can teach him some manners first."
tt0468569,"00:25:50,743","00:25:53,317","All right. so, listen, why don't you give me a call..."
tt0468569,"00:25:53,496","00:25:57,245",...when you wanna start taking things a little more seriously?
tt0468569,"00:25:57,417","00:25:59,290",Here's my card.
tt0468569,"00:26:19,397","00:26:21,769",You're a hard man to reach.
tt0468569,"00:26:24,777","00:26:27,066",Lau's halfway to hong kong.
tt0468569,"00:26:28,364","00:26:31,199","If you'd have asked, I could have taken his passport."
tt0468569,"00:26:31,367","00:26:34,037",All that was left in the vaults were marked bills.
tt0468569,"00:26:34,203","00:26:37,489",They knew we were coming. as soon as your office got involved...
tt0468569,"00:26:37,665","00:26:38,696",My office?
tt0468569,"00:26:38,875","00:26:40,459",You're sitting down there with scum
tt0468569,"00:26:40,460","00:26:42,540",Like Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking..
tt0468569,"00:26:42,712","00:26:45,832","Oh, yeah. I almost had your rookie cold on a racketeering beat."
tt0468569,"00:26:46,007","00:26:48,251",Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
tt0468569,"00:26:48,252","00:26:50,550","Maroni's got people in your office, Dent"
tt0468569,"00:26:53,348","00:26:55,305",We need Lau back...
tt0468569,"00:26:55,475","00:26:59,424",...but the chinese won't extradite a national under any circumstances.
tt0468569,"00:26:59,771","00:27:02,475","If I get him to you, can you get him to talk?"
tt0468569,"00:27:02,648","00:27:03,847",I'll get him to sing.
tt0468569,"00:27:04,025","00:27:06,777",We're going after the mob's life savings.
tt0468569,"00:27:06,944","00:27:08,189",Things will get ugly.
tt0468569,"00:27:08,363","00:27:10,651","I knew the risk when I took this job, lieutenant."
tt0468569,"00:27:10,823","00:27:12,365","How will you get him back, any...?"
tt0468569,"00:27:14,952","00:27:16,363",He does that.
tt0468569,"00:27:16,537","00:27:20,037",Our chinese friends left town before I could tell them the deal was off.
tt0468569,"00:27:20,208","00:27:23,707","Well, I'm sure that you've always wanted to go to hong kong."
tt0468569,"00:27:23,878","00:27:26,036",What's wrong with a phone call?
tt0468569,"00:27:26,214","00:27:29,832",I think mr. Lau deserves a more personal touch.
tt0468569,"00:27:31,052","00:27:32,879","Now, for high-altitude jumps..."
tt0468569,"00:27:33,054","00:27:35,841",...you're going to need oxygen and stabilizers.
tt0468569,"00:27:36,015","00:27:39,633","Well, I must say, compared to your usual requests..."
tt0468569,"00:27:39,811","00:27:42,384",...jumping out of an airplane is pretty straightforward.
tt0468569,"00:27:43,022","00:27:45,145",What about getting back into the plane?
tt0468569,"00:27:45,316","00:27:49,148",- I'd recommend a good travel agent. - without it landing.
tt0468569,"00:27:50,321","00:27:53,073","Now, that's more like it, mr. Wayne."
tt0468569,"00:27:53,616","00:27:56,237",The cia had a program back in the '60s...

tt0468569,"00:42:54,434","00:42:58,052","Huh? yeah. oh, shh, shh, shh."
tt0468569,"00:42:58,229","00:43:02,690",So you think batman 's made Gotham a better place? hm?
tt0468569,"00:43:02,900","00:43:04,443",Look at me.
tt0468569,"00:43:04,610","00:43:06,899",Look at me!
tt0468569,"00:43:10,658","00:43:14,157","You see, this is how crazy batman 's made Gotham."
tt0468569,"00:43:14,328","00:43:16,617",You want order in Gotham...
tt0468569,"00:43:16,956","00:43:21,369",... batman must take off his mask and turn himself in.
tt0468569,"00:43:21,544","00:43:25,328","Oh, and every day he doesn 't, people will die."
tt0468569,"00:43:25,673","00:43:27,796",Starting tonight.
tt0468569,"00:43:28,217","00:43:30,424",I'm a man of my word.
tt0468569,"00:43:47,695","00:43:50,530","Harvey Dent, scourge of the underworld..."
tt0468569,"00:43:50,698","00:43:53,783",...scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade.
tt0468569,"00:43:53,951","00:43:55,196",- I'll be back. - Rachel.
tt0468569,"00:43:55,370","00:43:58,205","A little liquid courage, mr. Dent?"
tt0468569,"00:43:58,373","00:44:00,780","- thank you. Alfred, right? - that's right, sir."
tt0468569,"00:44:00,958","00:44:04,244",Rachel talks about you all the time. you've known her her whole life.
tt0468569,"00:44:04,420","00:44:05,665","Not yet, sir."
tt0468569,"00:44:07,965","00:44:10,207",Any psychotic ex-boyfriends I should be aware of?
tt0468569,"00:44:10,385","00:44:12,626","Oh, you have no idea."
tt0468569,"00:44:31,572","00:44:32,983",I'm sorry that I'm late.
tt0468569,"00:44:33,157","00:44:35,529",I'm glad to see that you all got started without me.
tt0468569,"00:44:35,702","00:44:39,402","Now, where is Harvey? where...?"
tt0468569,"00:44:39,580","00:44:41,988","Harvey Dent, the man of the hour."
tt0468569,"00:44:42,166","00:44:43,495",Where's Rachel Dawes?
tt0468569,"00:44:43,668","00:44:46,040",She is my oldest friend. come here.
tt0468569,"00:44:46,212","00:44:48,703",When Rachel first told me she was dating Harvey Dent...
tt0468569,"00:44:48,881","00:44:50,079",...I had one thing to say
tt0468569,"00:44:50,299","00:44:52,707","""the guy from those god-awful campaign commercials?"""
tt0468569,"00:44:52,885","00:44:56,717","""i believe in Harvey Dent."" yeah, nice slogan, Harvey."
tt0468569,"00:44:56,889","00:44:58,882",But it caught Rachel's attention.
tt0468569,"00:44:59,058","00:45:02,059",And then I started to pay attention to Harvey...
tt0468569,"00:45:02,478","00:45:05,764",...and all that he's been doing as our new da.
tt0468569,"00:45:05,940","00:45:07,731",And you know what?
tt0468569,"00:45:09,777","00:45:11,271",I believe in Harvey Dent.
tt0468569,"00:45:11,446","00:45:15,028","I believe that on his watch, Gotham can feel..."
tt0468569,"00:45:15,199","00:45:18,864","...a little safer, a little more optimistic."
tt0468569,"00:45:20,288","00:45:24,617",Look at this face. this is the face of Gotham's bright future.
tt0468569,"00:45:24,792","00:45:26,951",To Harvey Dent. let's hear it for him.
tt0468569,"00:45:27,337","00:45:28,879",Harvey.
tt0468569,"00:45:38,389","00:45:39,848",Harvey may not know you well enough...
tt0468569,"00:45:40,016","00:45:41,973",...to understand you're making fun of him...
tt0468569,"00:45:42,143","00:45:44,136","...but I do. - no, I meant every word."
tt0468569,"00:45:45,480","00:45:48,397",You know that day that you once told me about...
tt0468569,"00:45:48,566","00:45:50,642",...when Gotham would no longer need batman?
tt0468569,"00:45:50,818","00:45:52,728",- it's coming. - Bruce.
tt0468569,"00:45:53,571","00:45:56,117",- you can't ask me to wait for that.
tt0468569,"00:45:56,118","00:45:59,158",- it's happening now. Harvey is that hero
tt0468569,"00:45:59,327","00:46:01,056",He locked up half of the city's
tt0468569,"00:46:01,057","00:46:03,788","Criminals, and he did it without wearing a mask"
tt0468569,"00:46:03,956","00:46:06,163",Gotham needs a hero with a face.
tt0468569,"00:46:07,001","00:46:09,290","You can throw a party, Wayne, I'll give you that."
tt0468569,"00:46:10,672","00:46:12,581",Thanks again.
tt0468569,"00:46:13,383","00:46:15,091",You mind if I borrow Rachel?
tt0468569,"00:46:18,554","00:46:20,927","Lieutenant, that Joker card pinned to the body?"
tt0468569,"00:46:21,099","00:46:22,842",Forensics found three sets of dna.
tt0468569,"00:46:23,017","00:46:24,428",#NAME?
tt0468569,"00:46:24,602","00:46:28,101","The dna belongs to judge Surrillo, Harvey Dent and commissioner loeb."
tt0468569,"00:46:28,272","00:46:30,265",The Joker's telling us who he's targeting.
tt0468569,"00:46:30,441","00:46:33,312",Get a unit over to Surrillo's house. tell Wuertz to find Dent.
tt0468569,"00:46:33,486","00:46:35,526",Protective custody. where's the commissioner?
tt0468569,"00:46:35,697","00:46:37,191",#NAME?
tt0468569,"00:46:37,365","00:46:39,357",#NAME?
tt0468569,"00:46:51,671","00:46:54,043",Gordon. what are you up to?
tt0468569,"00:46:54,215","00:46:57,465",We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor search of the entire building.
tt0468569,"00:46:57,635","00:47:00,209",We believe the Joker's made a threat against your life.
tt0468569,"00:47:00,388","00:47:01,799",These are dangerous people.
tt0468569,"00:47:01,973","00:47:03,716",You're not giving me a lot of information.
tt0468569,"00:47:03,891","00:47:05,849",Even we don't know where you're going.
tt0468569,"00:47:06,019","00:47:09,352","Take the envelope, get in, open it. it'll tell you where you're headed."
tt0468569,"00:47:13,192","00:47:15,102",You can't leave me alone with these people.
tt0468569,"00:47:15,278","00:47:18,314",The whole mob's after you and you're worried about these guys?
tt0468569,"00:47:18,489","00:47:20,446","Compared to this, the mob doesn't scare me."
tt0468569,"00:47:20,616","00:47:24,199","Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this for yourself, so..."
tt0468569,"00:47:24,370","00:47:28,450","...take my word, the police commissioner earns a lot of threats."
tt0468569,"00:47:28,624","00:47:34,164",I found the appropriate response to these situations a long time ago.
tt0468569,"00:47:34,380","00:47:36,622",Them gunning for you makes you see things clearly.
tt0468569,"00:47:36,799","00:47:38,128","Yeah, I bet."
tt0468569,"00:47:38,301","00:47:42,595",Yeah. it makes you think about things you couldn't stand losing...
tt0468569,"00:47:42,764","00:47:44,756",...about who you wanna spend your life with.
tt0468569,"00:47:44,932","00:47:47,933",- that's a pretty big commitment. - not if the mob has their way.
tt0468569,"00:47:53,149","00:47:55,854",You get to explain to my wife...
tt0468569,"00:47:56,778","00:47:58,355",...why I'm late for dinner.
tt0468569,"00:47:58,529","00:48:01,696","Sir, the Joker card had traces of your dna on it."
tt0468569,"00:48:03,284","00:48:05,905",- don't do that. - all right.
tt0468569,"00:48:06,454","00:48:09,371","- let's be serious, then. - okay."
tt0468569,"00:48:09,707","00:48:10,738",What's your answer?
tt0468569,"00:48:16,923","00:48:18,417",I don't have an answer.
tt0468569,"00:48:20,593","00:48:21,624",How'd they get my dna?
tt0468569,"00:48:21,803","00:48:23,961",Somebody with access to your office or house...
tt0468569,"00:48:24,138","00:48:26,760",...must have lifted a tissue or a glass... wait! wait!
tt0468569,"00:48:26,933","00:48:29,850",#NAME?
tt0468569,"00:48:30,019","00:48:32,142","- it's someone else, isn't it? - Harvey."
tt0468569,"00:48:32,313","00:48:35,480",Just tell me it's not Wayne. the guy's a complete f...
tt0468569,"00:48:35,983","00:48:37,442",What are you doing?
tt0468569,"00:48:48,621","00:48:49,652","Oh, shit."
tt0468569,"00:48:55,837","00:48:57,580",Get a medic!
tt0468569,"00:49:01,009","00:49:02,123",They've come for him.
tt0468569,"00:49:03,636","00:49:04,799",We made it.
tt0468569,"00:49:07,390","00:49:08,421",Stay hidden.
tt0468569,"00:49:10,685","00:49:14,018","Good evening, ladies and gentlemen."
tt0468569,"00:49:16,941","00:49:20,855",We are tonight's entertainment.
tt0468569,"00:49:21,696","00:49:24,021",I only have one question:
tt0468569,"00:49:24,240","00:49:27,775",Where is Harvey Dent?
tt0468569,"00:49:37,253","00:49:39,329",You know where Harvey is? you know who he is?
tt0468569,"00:49:39,505","00:49:40,786","Hands up, pretty boy."
tt0468569,"00:49:47,930","00:49:50,718",Do you know where I can find Harvey? I need to talk to him.
tt0468569,"00:49:50,892","00:49:53,727","Just something little, huh? no."
tt0468569,"00:49:56,022","00:49:58,774",What's going on out there? Wayne!
tt0468569,"00:50:00,234","00:50:01,610","Oh, thank god, you've got a panic room."
tt0468569,"00:50:01,778","00:50:02,940","Hey, wait..."
tt0468569,"00:50:03,529","00:50:05,321","Oh, you gotta be kidding me."
tt0468569,"00:50:05,615","00:50:07,607","You know, I'll settle for his loved ones."
tt0468569,"00:50:07,784","00:50:11,283",We're not intimidated by thugs.
tt0468569,"00:50:12,246","00:50:13,954",You know...
tt0468569,"00:50:15,583","00:50:18,584",...you remind me of my father.
tt0468569,"00:50:19,045","00:50:20,872",I hated my father.
tt0468569,"00:50:21,047","00:50:23,086","Okay, stop."
tt0468569,"00:50:26,928","00:50:29,763","Well, hello, beautiful."
tt0468569,"00:50:31,933","00:50:35,765",You must be Harvey's squeeze. hm?
tt0468569,"00:50:36,145","00:50:38,636",And you are beautiful.
tt0468569,"00:50:45,571","00:50:49,439",You look nervous. is it the scars?
tt0468569,"00:50:50,368","00:50:52,574",You wanna know how I got them?
tt0468569,"00:50:53,788","00:50:56,326",Come here. hey.
tt0468569,"00:50:56,708","00:50:58,415",Look at me.
tt0468569,"00:50:58,876","00:51:03,622","So I had a wife. she was beautiful, like you..."
tt0468569,"00:51:03,881","00:51:08,093",...who tells me I worry too much...
tt0468569,"00:51:08,261","00:51:11,178",...who tells me I ought to smile more...
tt0468569,"00:51:11,347","00:51:16,852",...who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. hey.
tt0468569,"00:51:17,270","00:51:19,677",One day they carve her face.
tt0468569,"00:51:20,189","00:51:24,436",And we have no money for surgeries. she can't take it.
tt0468569,"00:51:24,819","00:51:28,318",I just wanna see her smile again. hm?
tt0468569,"00:51:28,656","00:51:31,574",I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars.
tt0468569,"00:51:32,118","00:51:33,660",So...
tt0468569,"00:51:34,245","00:51:37,910",...i stick a razor in my mouth and do this...
tt0468569,"00:51:38,374","00:51:39,750",...to myself.
tt0468569,"00:51:40,043","00:51:45,119",And you know what? she can't stand the sight of me.
tt0468569,"00:51:45,298","00:51:46,840",She leaves.
tt0468569,"00:51:47,550","00:51:49,958",Now I see the funny side.
tt0468569,"00:51:50,845","00:51:52,423",Now I'm always smiling.
tt0468569,"00:51:55,850","00:51:59,184",You got a little fight in you. I like that.
tt0468569,"00:51:59,354","00:52:00,682",Then you're gonna love me.
tt0468569,"00:52:28,841","00:52:30,039",Drop the gun.
tt0468569,"00:52:30,218","00:52:32,839","Oh, sure. you just take off your little mask..."
tt0468569,"00:52:33,012","00:52:35,219",...and show us all who you really are. hm?
tt0468569,"00:52:40,853","00:52:42,051",Let her go.
tt0468569,"00:52:42,855","00:52:44,266",Very poor choice of words.
tt0468569,"00:53:07,088","00:53:08,962",Are you all right?
tt0468569,"00:53:11,217","00:53:13,589",Let's not do that again.
tt0468569,"00:53:13,886","00:53:16,377",- is Harvey okay? - he's safe.
tt0468569,"00:53:17,932","00:53:19,261",Thank you.
tt0468569,"00:53:19,600","00:53:20,632","Jim, it's over."
tt0468569,"00:53:20,810","00:53:23,383","As long as they don't get to Lau, we've cut off their funds."
tt0468569,"00:53:23,563","00:53:25,057",The prosecution's over.
tt0468569,"00:53:25,231","00:53:26,891",Nobody's standing up in front of a judge...
tt0468569,"00:53:27,066","00:53:30,067",...while judges and police commissioners are getting blown away.
tt0468569,"00:53:30,236","00:53:32,027",- what about Dent? - he's got any sense...
tt0468569,"00:53:32,196","00:53:33,276",...Dent's halfway to mex...
tt0468569,"00:53:33,448","00:53:35,025",So where do you keep your trash?
tt0468569,"00:53:36,367","00:53:37,420",You're due in court.
tt0468569,"00:53:37,421","00:53:40,317",I need you alive long enough to get you on the record
tt0468569,"00:53:40,496","00:53:43,533",You can't protect me. you can't even protect yourselves.
tt0468569,"00:53:43,708","00:53:47,041","You refuse to cooperate, you're not coming back here, you go to county."
tt0468569,"00:53:47,211","00:53:49,667",How long do you calculate you'll last in there?
tt0468569,"00:53:51,090","00:53:52,584",Targeting me won't get their money.
tt0468569,"00:53:52,759","00:53:54,585",I knew the mob wouldn't go down easily...
tt0468569,"00:53:54,761","00:53:56,837",...but this is different. they crossed a line.
tt0468569,"00:53:57,013","00:53:58,258",You crossed the line first.
tt0468569,"00:53:58,431","00:54:01,847","You squeezed them, you hammered them to the point of desperation."
tt0468569,"00:54:02,018","00:54:03,661","And in their desperation,"
tt0468569,"00:54:03,662","00:54:07,012",They turned to a man they didn't fully understand
tt0468569,"00:54:07,523","00:54:10,061","Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred."

tt0468569,"00:54:12,612","00:54:14,023","With respect, master Wayne..."
tt0468569,"00:54:14,197","00:54:17,151",...perhaps this is a man you don't fully understand either.
tt0468569,"00:54:17,950","00:54:20,655","A long time ago, I was in burma..."
tt0468569,"00:54:20,828","00:54:24,244",...and my friends and I were working for the local government.
tt0468569,"00:54:24,415","00:54:26,989",They were trying to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders...
tt0468569,"00:54:27,168","00:54:30,003",...by bribing them with precious stones...
tt0468569,"00:54:30,171","00:54:32,375",...but their caravans were being raided
tt0468569,"00:54:32,376","00:54:34,750",In a forest north of rangoon by a bandit
tt0468569,"00:54:34,926","00:54:38,211",So we went looking for the stones.
tt0468569,"00:54:38,596","00:54:43,721","But in six months, we never met anyone who traded with him."
tt0468569,"00:54:44,352","00:54:48,350","One day, I saw a child playing with a ruby..."
tt0468569,"00:54:48,523","00:54:51,559",...the size of a tangerine.
tt0468569,"00:54:51,818","00:54:55,187",The bandit had been throwing them away.

tt0468569,"00:57:33,896","00:57:35,556",...just disappeared overnight.
tt0468569,"00:57:35,732","00:57:39,979",I went down to the archives and I started pulling some old files.
tt0468569,"00:57:41,112","00:57:42,986",Don't tell me you didn't recognize your baby...
tt0468569,"00:57:43,156","00:57:46,774",...pancaking cop cars on the evening news.

tt0468569,"00:59:16,791","00:59:18,830",Wasn't aware we had any government contracts.
tt0468569,"00:59:19,085","00:59:22,086","You know, Lucius, I'm playing this one pretty close to the chest."
tt0468569,"00:59:23,214","00:59:24,922",Fair enough.
tt0468569,"00:59:27,844","00:59:29,302",With no word from the batman...
tt0468569,"00:59:29,470","00:59:30,965",...even as they mourn commissioner loeb...
tt0468569,"00:59:31,139","00:59:34,508",...these cops have to wonder if the Joker will make good on his threat...
tt0468569,"00:59:34,684","00:59:37,887",...in the obituary column of the Gotham times to kill the mayor.
tt0468569,"00:59:39,689","00:59:43,354",I've checked all the databases. there are four possibles.
tt0468569,"00:59:43,526","00:59:45,649",Cross-reference the addresses.
tt0468569,"00:59:45,820","00:59:49,818","Look for parkside, overlooking the parade."
tt0468569,"00:59:51,034","00:59:52,148",I got one.

tt0468569,"01:00:41,626","01:00:45,161","We're tight, but frankly, there's a lot of windows up here."
tt0468569,"01:00:53,721","01:00:57,766",Commissioner loeb dedicated his life to law enforcement...
tt0468569,"01:00:57,934","01:01:00,223",...and to the protection of his community.
tt0468569,"01:01:00,395","01:01:02,186",I remember when I first took office...
tt0468569,"01:01:02,355","01:01:04,893",...and I asked if he wanted to stay on as commissioner.
tt0468569,"01:01:05,066","01:01:10,309","And he said he would, provided I kept my politics out of his office."
tt0468569,"01:01:14,075","01:01:17,242","Clearly he was not a man who minced words, nor should he have been."
tt0468569,"01:01:18,413","01:01:21,912",A number of policies that he enacted as commissioner were unpopular.
tt0468569,"01:01:22,083","01:01:25,333",Policies that flooded my office with angry calls and letters...
tt0468569,"01:01:29,716","01:01:31,376",- who's that? - what happened?
tt0468569,"01:01:32,427","01:01:34,300",They took our guns.
tt0468569,"01:01:34,470","01:01:36,262",And our uniforms.
tt0468569,"01:01:42,854","01:01:45,605",And as we recognize the sacrifice of this man...
tt0468569,"01:01:45,773","01:01:49,723",...we must remember that vigilance is the price of safety.
tt0468569,"01:01:49,902","01:01:52,393",Stand by. honor guard.
tt0468569,"01:01:52,572","01:01:56,190",Attention. port arms.

tt0468569,"01:02:18,556","01:02:19,967",Stay down! don't move!
tt0468569,"01:02:21,809","01:02:23,469",Mr. mayor. get him out of here.
tt0468569,"01:02:32,695","01:02:34,937",- I'll see you later. - why are you going back?
tt0468569,"01:02:47,585","01:02:48,616",Get out of here.
tt0468569,"01:02:52,674","01:02:54,417",Tell me what you know about the Joker.

tt0468569,"01:03:29,460","01:03:32,710","Jimmy, go play with your sister. go ahead, honey."
tt0468569,"01:03:32,880","01:03:35,122","If there's anything we can do, anything you need..."
tt0468569,"01:03:35,299","01:03:37,043",...we're here for you.

tt0468569,"01:03:43,307","01:03:47,804",Are you? you brought this craziness on us. you did!
tt0468569,"01:03:47,979","01:03:50,351",You brought this on us!
tt0468569,"01:03:51,399","01:03:55,977","Switch it off, he ain't coming. he doesn't wanna talk to us."
tt0468569,"01:03:56,404","01:03:59,405",God help whoever he does wanna talk to.
tt0468569,"01:04:01,075","01:04:03,993",Can't we go someplace quieter? we can't hear each other talk.
tt0468569,"01:04:04,162","01:04:06,997",What makes you think I wanna hear you talk?
tt0468569,"01:04:07,165","01:04:08,196",What?

tt0468569,"01:04:48,655","01:04:50,537","- Rachel, listen to me. you're not safe there"
tt0468569,"01:04:50,708","01:04:52,500",- this is Gordon's unit. - Gordon 's gone.
tt0468569,"01:04:52,669","01:04:56,251",He vouched for these men. - and he's gone.
tt0468569,"01:05:00,885","01:05:02,961",The Joker's named you next.
tt0468569,"01:05:03,137","01:05:06,138","God, is there someone, is there anyone in this town we can trust?"
tt0468569,"01:05:06,307","01:05:08,015",Bruce.
tt0468569,"01:05:08,309","01:05:09,472",We can trust Bruce Wayne.
tt0468569,"01:05:09,644","01:05:11,221","No. Rachel, I know you're his friend, but..."
tt0468569,"01:05:11,396","01:05:13,222","Harvey, trust me."
tt0468569,"01:05:13,398","01:05:16,149",Bruce's penthouse is now the safest place in the city.
tt0468569,"01:05:16,317","01:05:17,646",Then you go straight there.
tt0468569,"01:05:17,819","01:05:19,942",Don 't tell anybody and I'll find you there.
tt0468569,"01:05:20,113","01:05:21,821",I love you.
tt0468569,"01:05:35,837","01:05:37,082",I want the Joker.
tt0468569,"01:05:38,297","01:05:39,957",From one professional to another...
tt0468569,"01:05:40,133","01:05:42,671","...you're trying to scare somebody, pick a better spot."
tt0468569,"01:05:42,844","01:05:45,417","From this height, the fall wouldn't kill me."
tt0468569,"01:05:45,596","01:05:47,174",- I'm counting on it. - huh!
tt0468569,"01:05:54,564","01:05:57,684",- where is he? - I don't know where he is. he found us.
tt0468569,"01:05:57,859","01:05:59,139",He must have friends.
tt0468569,"01:05:59,485","01:06:01,774",Friends? have you met this guy?
tt0468569,"01:06:01,946","01:06:03,524",Someone knows where he is.
tt0468569,"01:06:03,698","01:06:06,189",Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.
tt0468569,"01:06:06,367","01:06:07,696",They're wise to your act.
tt0468569,"01:06:07,869","01:06:11,866","You got rules. the Joker, he's got no rules."
tt0468569,"01:06:12,040","01:06:16,915","Nobody's gonna cross him for you. if you want this guy, you got one way."
tt0468569,"01:06:17,086","01:06:18,878",But you already know what that is.
tt0468569,"01:06:19,047","01:06:21,834","Just take off that mask, let him come find you."
tt0468569,"01:06:23,468","01:06:25,372",Or you can let a couple more people
tt0468569,"01:06:25,373","01:06:27,548",Get killed while you make up your mind
tt0468569,"01:06:29,223","01:06:31,216",You wanna play games?
tt0468569,"01:06:37,523","01:06:38,555",How's that feel?
tt0468569,"01:06:38,733","01:06:41,354",- you wouldn't. - I wouldn't!
tt0468569,"01:06:42,862","01:06:44,487",- you don't think I will? - mm-mm.
tt0468569,"01:06:44,655","01:06:46,695",- you don't think I will? - mm-mm.
tt0468569,"01:06:48,076","01:06:51,279","No. no, I wouldn't."
tt0468569,"01:06:52,497","01:06:55,035",That's why I'm not gonna leave it up to me.
tt0468569,"01:06:56,042","01:06:59,043","Heads, you get to keep your head."
tt0468569,"01:06:59,462","01:07:01,087",Tails...
tt0468569,"01:07:02,048","01:07:03,079",...not so lucky.
tt0468569,"01:07:03,466","01:07:07,001",So you wanna tell me about the Joker?
tt0468569,"01:07:16,396","01:07:20,096","- let's go again. - I don't know anything! god, don't!"
tt0468569,"01:07:20,274","01:07:22,647","You're not playing the odds, friend."
tt0468569,"01:07:23,778","01:07:25,771",Let's do it again.
tt0468569,"01:07:28,616","01:07:30,443",You'd leave a man's life to chance?
tt0468569,"01:07:31,202","01:07:34,785","- not exactly. - his name's Schiff, Thomas."
tt0468569,"01:07:34,956","01:07:37,957","He's a paranoid schizophrenic, former patient at Arkham."
tt0468569,"01:07:38,126","01:07:42,752",The kind of mind the Joker attracts. what do you expect to learn from him?
tt0468569,"01:07:46,092","01:07:48,879",The Joker killed Gordon. he's gonna kill Rachel.
tt0468569,"01:07:49,053","01:07:51,840",You're the symbol of hope I could never be.
tt0468569,"01:07:52,015","01:07:53,841",Your stand against organized crime...
tt0468569,"01:07:54,017","01:07:57,220",...is the first legitimate ray of light in Gotham in decades.
tt0468569,"01:07:57,395","01:08:01,013","If anyone saw this, everything would be undone."
tt0468569,"01:08:01,190","01:08:03,479",The criminals you arrested would be released...
tt0468569,"01:08:03,651","01:08:06,735",...and Jim Gordon will have died for nothing.
tt0468569,"01:08:07,363","01:08:09,605",You're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow.
tt0468569,"01:08:09,782","01:08:12,154",#NAME?
tt0468569,"01:08:12,326","01:08:14,652",Gotham's in your hands now.
tt0468569,"01:08:14,829","01:08:16,537",You can't.
tt0468569,"01:08:16,706","01:08:18,081",You can't give in.
tt0468569,"01:08:18,374","01:08:20,912",You can't give in!
tt0468569,"01:08:36,267","01:08:37,512",Harvey called.
tt0468569,"01:08:37,685","01:08:40,722",He said batman's gonna turn himself in.
tt0468569,"01:08:40,897","01:08:42,011",I have no choice.
tt0468569,"01:08:42,190","01:08:45,274",You honestly think that's gonna keep the Joker from killing people?
tt0468569,"01:08:45,443","01:08:48,894",Maybe not. but I have enough blood on my hands.
tt0468569,"01:08:49,364","01:08:54,191",And I've seen now what I would have to become to stop men like him.
tt0468569,"01:08:54,744","01:08:58,195",You once told me that if the day came when I was finished...
tt0468569,"01:08:58,373","01:09:00,449",...that we'd be together.
tt0468569,"01:09:01,167","01:09:04,334","Bruce, don't make me your one hope for a normal life."
tt0468569,"01:09:05,880","01:09:07,208",Did you mean it?
tt0468569,"01:09:08,716","01:09:10,543",Yes.
tt0468569,"01:09:27,819","01:09:29,610",Bruce.
tt0468569,"01:09:30,571","01:09:34,486","If you turn yourself in, they're not gonna let us be together."
tt0468569,"01:09:45,128","01:09:48,082",Logs as well? everything.
tt0468569,"01:09:48,256","01:09:51,625",Anything that could lead back to Lucius or Rachel.
tt0468569,"01:09:56,973","01:10:00,258","People are dying, Alfred. what would you have me do?"
tt0468569,"01:10:00,435","01:10:04,183","Endure, master Wayne. take it."
tt0468569,"01:10:04,355","01:10:08,056","They'll hate you for it, but that's the point of batman."
tt0468569,"01:10:08,234","01:10:13,774",He can be the outcast. he can make the choice that no one else can make.
tt0468569,"01:10:13,948","01:10:15,277",The right choice.
tt0468569,"01:10:15,783","01:10:18,820","No, today I found out what batman can't do."
tt0468569,"01:10:18,995","01:10:20,240",He can't endure this.
tt0468569,"01:10:20,538","01:10:23,409","Today you get to say ""i told you so."""
tt0468569,"01:10:24,000","01:10:27,167","Today, I don't want to."
tt0468569,"01:10:33,009","01:10:34,468",But I did bloody tell you.
tt0468569,"01:10:37,513","01:10:40,514",I suppose they're gonna lock me up as well...
tt0468569,"01:10:41,309","01:10:42,554",...as your accomplice.
tt0468569,"01:10:42,727","01:10:47,472",Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.
tt0468569,"01:10:51,736","01:10:55,271","Ladies and gentlemen, I've called this press conference for two reasons."
tt0468569,"01:10:55,448","01:10:57,487","Firstly, to assure the citizens of Gotham..."
tt0468569,"01:10:57,658","01:11:01,324",...that everything that can be done over the Joker killings is being done.
tt0468569,"01:11:02,705","01:11:05,790","Secondly, because the batman has offered to turn himself in."
tt0468569,"01:11:05,958","01:11:07,666",But let's consider the situation.
tt0468569,"01:11:08,044","01:11:10,665",Should we give in to this terrorist's demands?
tt0468569,"01:11:10,838","01:11:12,297",Do we really think he's gonna...?
tt0468569,"01:11:12,465","01:11:15,834",You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante than the lives of citizens?
tt0468569,"01:11:16,010","01:11:18,382",The batman is an outlaw.
tt0468569,"01:11:19,263","01:11:21,173",That's not why we demand he turn himself in...
tt0468569,"01:11:21,349","01:11:23,009",...we're doing it because we're scared.
tt0468569,"01:11:23,184","01:11:25,971",We've been happy to let batman clean up our streets till now.
tt0468569,"01:11:26,145","01:11:29,099",Things are worse than ever! amen.
tt0468569,"01:11:30,441","01:11:32,350","Yes, they are."
tt0468569,"01:11:34,862","01:11:37,863",But the night is darkest just before the dawn.
tt0468569,"01:11:40,326","01:11:42,402",And I promise you...
tt0468569,"01:11:43,204","01:11:44,615",...the dawn is coming.
tt0468569,"01:11:44,789","01:11:46,652","One day, the batman will have to"
tt0468569,"01:11:46,653","01:11:49,332",Answer for the laws he's broken. but to us..
tt0468569,"01:11:49,502","01:11:51,245",...not to this madman.
tt0468569,"01:11:51,421","01:11:53,746",- no more dead cops! yeah!
tt0468569,"01:11:57,051","01:11:58,629",He should turn himself in!
tt0468569,"01:11:58,803","01:12:01,508",Give us the batman! come on! where is he?
tt0468569,"01:12:04,392","01:12:06,550",So be it. take the batman into custody.
tt0468569,"01:12:07,020","01:12:08,977",What? is he here?
tt0468569,"01:12:09,689","01:12:10,720",I am the batman.
tt0468569,"01:12:11,065","01:12:14,066",What? come on.
tt0468569,"01:12:22,452","01:12:24,361",Alfred.
tt0468569,"01:12:25,705","01:12:27,496",Why is he letting Harvey do this?
tt0468569,"01:12:27,665","01:12:30,666",#NAME?
tt0468569,"01:12:30,835","01:12:32,911",Perhaps both Bruce and mr. Dent...
tt0468569,"01:12:33,087","01:12:36,088",...believe that batman stands for something more important...
tt0468569,"01:12:36,257","01:12:38,582","...than the whims of a terrorist, miss Dawes..."
tt0468569,"01:12:38,760","01:12:40,752",...even if everyone hates him for it.
tt0468569,"01:12:40,928","01:12:43,051",That's the sacrifice he's making.
tt0468569,"01:12:43,222","01:12:46,841",He's not being a hero. he's being something more.
tt0468569,"01:12:47,393","01:12:49,018","Yeah, you're absolutely right."
tt0468569,"01:12:49,187","01:12:52,271",Letting Harvey take the fall for this is not heroic at all.
tt0468569,"01:12:54,942","01:12:56,567",You know him better than anyone.
tt0468569,"01:12:56,986","01:12:58,017",I do.
tt0468569,"01:13:01,407","01:13:04,444",Will you give this to him for me? when the time is right?
tt0468569,"01:13:05,912","01:13:07,110",How will I know?
tt0468569,"01:13:07,288","01:13:08,782",It's not sealed.
tt0468569,"01:13:10,208","01:13:11,750","Goodbye, Alfred."
tt0468569,"01:13:15,922","01:13:17,665","Bye, Rachel."
tt0468569,"01:13:25,556","01:13:27,383",I didn't have time to talk this through.
tt0468569,"01:13:27,558","01:13:28,803",What are you doing?
tt0468569,"01:13:28,976","01:13:31,053",They're transferring me to central holding.
tt0468569,"01:13:31,354","01:13:32,606","This is the Joker's chance,"
tt0468569,"01:13:32,607","01:13:35,019","And when he attacks, the batman will take him down"
tt0468569,"01:13:35,191","01:13:36,733",Listen. this is too dangerous.
tt0468569,"01:13:36,901","01:13:38,150","We get this guy to county,"
tt0468569,"01:13:38,151","01:13:40,602",He's their problem. the streets will be cleared..
tt0468569,"01:13:40,780","01:13:44,481",...so let's go. the convoys stop for no reason.
tt0468569,"01:13:44,659","01:13:46,118","I hope you got some moves, pal."
tt0468569,"01:13:46,285","01:13:49,203",He's using you as bait. he doesn't know if he can get the Joker.
tt0468569,"01:13:49,372","01:13:50,451",He's failed so far.
tt0468569,"01:13:50,790","01:13:52,332",How do you know what he's thinking?
tt0468569,"01:13:52,500","01:13:54,825","I just do. anyway, this isn't just about you."
tt0468569,"01:13:55,003","01:13:56,829",What about the people depending on you...
tt0468569,"01:13:57,005","01:14:00,005",...to clean the city up and do it honorably and...?
tt0468569,"01:14:05,680","01:14:08,301",Harvey. tell everyone the truth.
tt0468569,"01:14:08,683","01:14:10,557","Heads, I go through with it."
tt0468569,"01:14:10,768","01:14:12,677",This is your life. you can't leave...
tt0468569,"01:14:12,854","01:14:15,226",...something like that to chance. - I'm not.
tt0468569,"01:14:19,569","01:14:21,976",You make your own luck.
tt0468569,"01:14:43,801","01:14:45,794","Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal."
tt0468569,"01:14:53,436","01:14:55,761",What the hell is that?
tt0468569,"01:14:55,938","01:14:58,145","Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!"
tt0468569,"01:14:58,316","01:15:01,519","Damn it! all units divert down onto lower fifth. I repeat, exit down."
tt0468569,"01:15:01,944","01:15:03,059",Exit down!
tt0468569,"01:15:03,237","01:15:05,563",Lower fifth? we'll be like turkeys on thanksgiving.
tt0468569,"01:15:38,272","01:15:40,598","Jesus. come on, get us out of here. let's go."
tt0468569,"01:15:42,777","01:15:45,149","Listen, we need backup. we've got company."
tt0468569,"01:15:45,321","01:15:46,863","We got trouble, guys."
tt0468569,"01:15:49,784","01:15:50,863",Lock and load!
tt0468569,"01:16:02,088","01:16:03,463",The hell was that?
tt0468569,"01:16:25,319","01:16:27,989","- these are built for that, right? - he'll need something..."
tt0468569,"01:16:28,156","01:16:29,947",...a lot bigger to get through this.
tt0468569,"01:16:30,992","01:16:32,451",What is that?
tt0468569,"01:16:33,786","01:16:35,115","What is that, a bazooka?"
tt0468569,"01:16:43,755","01:16:45,463",I didn't sign up for this!
tt0468569,"01:17:01,814","01:17:03,143",Look out.
tt0468569,"01:17:03,941","01:17:05,104",Look out!
tt0468569,"01:17:27,382","01:17:28,496","Come on, let's go!"
tt0468569,"01:18:15,300","01:18:17,506","Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent."
tt0468569,"01:18:17,677","01:18:20,512","Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive."
tt0468569,"01:18:25,435","01:18:29,017",Scanning all systems. scanning all systems.
tt0468569,"01:18:36,487","01:18:38,610","We gotta get topside. we need air support, now!"
tt0468569,"01:18:44,120","01:18:45,994",I like this job. I like it.
tt0468569,"01:18:48,249","01:18:50,870",Damage catastrophic. eject sequence initiated.
tt0468569,"01:19:04,849","01:19:06,343",Goodbye.
tt0468569,"01:19:15,443","01:19:18,646","We're on point, ready to give them some of their own medicine."
tt0468569,"01:19:25,036","01:19:27,491",That's what I'm talking about. air cav.
tt0468569,"01:19:41,052","01:19:42,760","Okay, rack them up."
tt0468569,"01:19:42,929","01:19:45,301","Rack them up, rack them up, rack them up."
tt0468569,"01:20:11,040","01:20:12,203",That's not good.
tt0468569,"01:20:15,712","01:20:16,910","Okay, that's not good!"
tt0468569,"01:21:00,048","01:21:02,124","Now, there's a batman."
tt0468569,"01:21:06,429","01:21:07,627","Ooh, you wanna play. come on."
tt0468569,"01:21:10,558","01:21:11,673",Come on.
tt0468569,"01:21:20,818","01:21:22,063",He missed!
tt0468569,"01:21:36,000","01:21:38,408",You can't stop here. we're like sitting ducks!
tt0468569,"01:21:55,436","01:21:56,516","Come on, come on."
tt0468569,"01:21:59,649","01:22:03,018","Come on. come on. I want you to do it, I want you to do it. come on!"
tt0468569,"01:22:05,571","01:22:07,030",Come on.
tt0468569,"01:22:07,699","01:22:11,032","Come on. I want you to do it, I want you to do it. come on, hit me."
tt0468569,"01:22:11,202","01:22:12,827","Come on, hit me. come on, hit me!"
tt0468569,"01:22:14,956","01:22:15,987",Hit me!
tt0468569,"01:22:44,402","01:22:46,644",Could you please just give me a minute?
tt0468569,"01:22:48,740","01:22:50,566","We got you, you son of a bitch."
tt0468569,"01:22:53,870","01:22:57,784",Gor... you do like to play things pretty close to the chest.
tt0468569,"01:22:58,249","01:22:59,957","We got him, Harvey."
tt0468569,"01:23:00,126","01:23:03,577",Mr. Dent! how does it feel to be the biggest hero in Gotham?
tt0468569,"01:23:03,755","01:23:07,040","No, I'm no hero. Gotham's finest, they're the heroes."
tt0468569,"01:23:07,216","01:23:08,545",But you and your office...
tt0468569,"01:23:08,718","01:23:10,378",...have been working with the batman all along.
tt0468569,"01:23:10,553","01:23:12,344","No, but I trusted him to do the right thing."
tt0468569,"01:23:12,513","01:23:14,589",Which was? - saving my ass.
tt0468569,"01:23:14,766","01:23:17,683","All right, people, that's enough. let him be. let him be."
tt0468569,"01:23:17,852","01:23:19,761","Thank you, detective."
tt0468569,"01:23:19,979","01:23:22,102",I've got a date with a pretty upset girlfriend.
tt0468569,"01:23:22,273","01:23:24,645",#NAME?
tt0468569,"01:23:24,817","01:23:28,945","...how about one for the front page, sir? mr. Dent."
tt0468569,"01:23:40,291","01:23:43,458",Stand away! all of you!
tt0468569,"01:23:43,628","01:23:47,127","I don't want anything for his mob lawyer to use, you understand?"
tt0468569,"01:23:49,384","01:23:51,257",Back from the dead.
tt0468569,"01:23:51,928","01:23:53,470","I, uh..."
tt0468569,"01:23:53,638","01:23:55,547",...couldn't risk my family's safety.
tt0468569,"01:23:56,849","01:23:58,676",What do we got?
tt0468569,"01:24:00,353","01:24:04,303","Nothing. no matches on prints, dna, Dental."
tt0468569,"01:24:04,482","01:24:07,234","Clothing is custom, no labels."
tt0468569,"01:24:07,443","01:24:09,566",Nothing in his pockets but knives and lint.
tt0468569,"01:24:09,737","01:24:11,646",No name.
tt0468569,"01:24:11,990","01:24:13,947",#NAME?
tt0468569,"01:24:14,117","01:24:17,201",The clown'll keep till morning. go get some rest.
tt0468569,"01:24:17,370","01:24:19,197",You're gonna need it.

tt0468569,"01:25:55,593","01:25:57,800",Harvey Dent never made it home.

tt0468569,"01:26:13,903","01:26:17,237","Assuming, of course, that they are still your people..."
tt0468569,"01:26:17,407","01:26:20,111",...and not Maroni's.
tt0468569,"01:26:22,328","01:26:24,700","Does it depress you, commissioner..."
tt0468569,"01:26:25,123","01:26:30,081",...to know just how alone you really are?
tt0468569,"01:26:32,088","01:26:36,964",Does it make you feel responsible for Harvey Dent's current predicament?
tt0468569,"01:26:37,135","01:26:39,804",- where is he? - what's the time?
tt0468569,"01:26:40,305","01:26:41,799",What difference does that make?
tt0468569,"01:26:42,056","01:26:47,513","Well, depending on the time, he may be in one spot or several."
tt0468569,"01:26:53,901","01:26:56,855",- lf we're gonna play games... - mm-hm?

tt0468569,"01:27:06,914","01:27:07,946",Not exactly.
tt0468569,"01:27:18,468","01:27:19,799",Never start with the head.
tt0468569,"01:27:19,800","01:27:22,512",The victim gets all fuzzy. he can't feel the next..
tt0468569,"01:27:25,683","01:27:26,798",See?
tt0468569,"01:27:26,976","01:27:29,301",You wanted me. here I am.
tt0468569,"01:27:30,355","01:27:32,478",I wanted to see what you'd do.

tt0468569,"01:27:35,777","01:27:38,612",You let five people die.
tt0468569,"01:27:39,572","01:27:43,237",Then you let Dent take your place.
tt0468569,"01:27:43,409","01:27:46,031","- even to a guy like me, that's cold. - where's Dent?"
tt0468569,"01:27:46,204","01:27:50,996",Those mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were.
tt0468569,"01:27:51,501","01:27:56,246",But I know the truth. there's no going back. you've changed things.
tt0468569,"01:27:56,422","01:27:58,830",#NAME?
tt0468569,"01:28:01,803","01:28:03,213",I don't wanna kill you.
tt0468569,"01:28:03,721","01:28:08,264","What would I do without you? go back to ripping off mob dealers? no, no."
tt0468569,"01:28:08,434","01:28:10,806","No. no, you..."
tt0468569,"01:28:10,979","01:28:13,386",You complete me.
tt0468569,"01:28:13,564","01:28:15,566",- you're garbage who kills for money.
tt0468569,"01:28:15,567","01:28:17,894",- don't talk like one of them. you're not
tt0468569,"01:28:18,069","01:28:20,477",Even if you'd like to be.
tt0468569,"01:28:21,739","01:28:23,566","To them, you're just a freak..."
tt0468569,"01:28:24,492","01:28:25,820",...like me.
tt0468569,"01:28:25,994","01:28:28,282",They need you right now...
tt0468569,"01:28:28,871","01:28:30,911",...but when they don't...
tt0468569,"01:28:31,457","01:28:34,494",...they'll cast you out like a leper.
tt0468569,"01:28:34,669","01:28:38,583","You see, their morals, their code..."
tt0468569,"01:28:38,840","01:28:40,998",...it's a bad joke.
tt0468569,"01:28:41,259","01:28:44,592",Dropped at the first sign of trouble.
tt0468569,"01:28:45,263","01:28:49,261",They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show you.
tt0468569,"01:28:49,434","01:28:52,600","When the chips are down, these..."
tt0468569,"01:28:52,770","01:28:55,012",These civilized people...
tt0468569,"01:28:55,189","01:28:57,265",...they'll eat each other.
tt0468569,"01:28:57,984","01:29:00,356","See, I'm not a monster."
tt0468569,"01:29:01,738","01:29:03,018",I'm just ahead of the curve.
tt0468569,"01:29:05,283","01:29:06,362",Where's Dent?
tt0468569,"01:29:06,534","01:29:09,452","You have all these rules, and you think they'll save you."
tt0468569,"01:29:12,540","01:29:14,948",- he's in control. - I have one rule.
tt0468569,"01:29:15,126","01:29:18,210",Oh. then that's the rule you'll have to break to know the truth.
tt0468569,"01:29:18,379","01:29:19,542",Which is?
tt0468569,"01:29:19,714","01:29:22,122",The only sensible way to live is without rules.
tt0468569,"01:29:22,300","01:29:24,969",And tonight you're gonna break your one rule.
tt0468569,"01:29:25,136","01:29:26,167",I'm considering it.
tt0468569,"01:29:26,346","01:29:28,967","There's only minutes left, so you'll have to play my game..."
tt0468569,"01:29:29,140","01:29:31,713",...if you wanna save one of them.
tt0468569,"01:29:32,226","01:29:33,258","""them""?"
tt0468569,"01:29:33,436","01:29:37,481","You know, for a while there, I thought you really were Dent."
tt0468569,"01:29:37,649","01:29:40,270",The way you threw yourself after her.
tt0468569,"01:29:46,574","01:29:47,653",Look at you go.
tt0468569,"01:29:53,289","01:29:56,872",Does Harvey know about you and his little bunny?
tt0468569,"01:29:57,794","01:29:59,169",Where are they?!
tt0468569,"01:29:59,337","01:30:01,329",Killing is making a choice.
tt0468569,"01:30:01,506","01:30:04,590",- where are they?! - choose between one life or the other.
tt0468569,"01:30:05,343","01:30:09,590","Your friend the district attorney, or his blushing bride-to-be."
tt0468569,"01:30:14,769","01:30:18,849","You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with."
tt0468569,"01:30:19,273","01:30:22,773",Nothing to do with all your strength.
tt0468569,"01:30:22,986","01:30:26,401","Don't worry, I'm gonna tell you where they are, both of them."
tt0468569,"01:30:26,572","01:30:29,609",And that's the point. you'll have to choose.
tt0468569,"01:30:30,368","01:30:33,203",He's at 25052nd street...
tt0468569,"01:30:33,371","01:30:36,704",...and she's on avenue x at cicero.

tt0468569,"01:32:02,543","01:32:05,710",The boss said he'd make the voices go away.
tt0468569,"01:32:05,880","01:32:09,415",He said he'd go inside and replace them with bright lights...
tt0468569,"01:32:09,592","01:32:10,707",...like Christmas.

tt0468569,"01:37:22,530","01:37:24,736",... I meant it.
tt0468569,"01:37:24,991","01:37:29,736",But now I'm sure the day won 't come when you no longer need Batman.
tt0468569,"01:37:30,788","01:37:32,698",I hope it does.
tt0468569,"01:37:32,874","01:37:35,625","And if it does, I will be there..."
tt0468569,"01:37:36,169","01:37:37,579",... but as your friend.

tt0468569,"01:38:18,002","01:38:20,374","...not madness, not death."
tt0468569,"01:38:20,546","01:38:25,173",You have inspired good. But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals.
tt0468569,"01:38:25,343","01:38:27,419",Didn't you think there might be casualties?
tt0468569,"01:38:27,595","01:38:30,003",Things always get worse before they get better.
tt0468569,"01:38:30,348","01:38:31,807","But Rachel, Alfred."

tt0468569,"01:38:55,039","01:38:56,866","She was gonna wait for me, Alfred."
tt0468569,"01:38:58,876","01:39:00,916",Dent doesn't know.
tt0468569,"01:39:01,087","01:39:02,367",He can never know.

tt0468569,"01:40:00,938","01:40:04,307",He says he's waited as long as he can for batman to do the right thing.
tt0468569,"01:40:04,484","01:40:06,560",Now he's taking matters into his own hands.
tt0468569,"01:40:06,736","01:40:09,690",We'll be live at 5 with the true identity of the batman.

tt0468569,"02:02:14,605","02:02:16,515","Oh, and you might wanna decide quickly..."
tt0468569,"02:02:16,691","02:02:21,020",... because the people on the other boat may not be quite so noble.
tt0468569,"02:02:28,411","02:02:29,442",Stay back.
tt0468569,"02:02:29,620","02:02:33,404","Well, now, who are you to decide? we ought to talk this over, at least."
tt0468569,"02:02:33,791","02:02:37,374",We don't all have to die. those men had their chance.
tt0468569,"02:02:38,004","02:02:41,788",- we are not going to talk about this. - why aren't we talking about it?
tt0468569,"02:02:41,966","02:02:44,540",They're talking over the Same thing on the other boat.
tt0468569,"02:02:44,719","02:02:47,008",- let's put it to a vote. yes!
tt0468569,"02:02:52,310","02:02:54,883","- hello? Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez."
tt0468569,"02:02:55,063","02:02:58,099",Jim needs you to pack up and put the kids in the car right away.
tt0468569,"02:02:58,274","02:02:59,982",But the units outside...
tt0468569,"02:03:00,151","02:03:01,729",Those cops can 't be trusted.
tt0468569,"02:03:01,903","02:03:04,857",Jim needs you away from them as soon as possible.
tt0468569,"02:03:05,031","02:03:07,985","I'll call them off for 10 minutes, and you'll have to move fast."
tt0468569,"02:03:08,159","02:03:11,991",- but where am I supposed to take them? - 25052nd street.
tt0468569,"02:03:12,163","02:03:14,037",Leave as soon as the patrol car pulls out.
tt0468569,"02:03:14,207","02:03:15,582",Okay.
tt0468569,"02:03:15,958","02:03:17,750",She believe you?
tt0468569,"02:03:17,960","02:03:20,000",It's because she trusts you...
tt0468569,"02:03:20,338","02:03:21,417",...just like rachel did.
tt0468569,"02:03:21,589","02:03:23,665",- I didn't know... - didn't know what they'd do?
tt0468569,"02:03:23,841","02:03:26,593",You're the second cop to say that to me.
tt0468569,"02:03:26,844","02:03:28,967",What exactly did you think they were gonna do?
tt0468569,"02:03:29,138","02:03:31,380",They got me early on. my mother's hospital bills...
tt0468569,"02:03:31,557","02:03:34,594",- don't! - I'm sorry.
tt0468569,"02:03:35,144","02:03:37,600","You live to fight another day, officer."
tt0468569,"02:03:41,401","02:03:43,227",We found the missing hospital bus.
tt0468569,"02:03:43,403","02:03:45,111",Then we have a hostage situation.
tt0468569,"02:03:47,198","02:03:49,191",It's a shooting gallery.
tt0468569,"02:03:49,575","02:03:51,864",Why would he choose a spot with such big windows?
tt0468569,"02:03:52,036","02:03:53,863",We have clear shots on five clowns.
tt0468569,"02:03:54,038","02:03:56,790","Snipers take them out, smash the windows, a team rappels in."
tt0468569,"02:03:57,208","02:03:58,702",Team moves in by the stairwells.
tt0468569,"02:03:58,876","02:04:00,999","Two, three casualties max."
tt0468569,"02:04:01,170","02:04:03,044",- let's do it. it's not that simple.
tt0468569,"02:04:03,214","02:04:05,539","- with the joker, it never is. - what's simple is..."
tt0468569,"02:04:05,717","02:04:08,883","...every second, those people on the ferries get closer to blowing..."
tt0468569,"02:04:09,053","02:04:11,591",- that won't happen. - then he'll blow both of them up!
tt0468569,"02:04:11,764","02:04:13,592",- we don't have time for paper ballots.
tt0468569,"02:04:13,593","02:04:15,513",#NAME?
tt0468569,"02:04:15,685","02:04:17,678",...on this piece of paper.
tt0468569,"02:04:18,730","02:04:21,565","If anyone's got pens, pass it along."

tt0468569,"02:04:40,001","02:04:41,828",No! there's no time!
tt0468569,"02:04:42,003","02:04:43,414",We have clear shots!
tt0468569,"02:04:43,588","02:04:46,505",Dent is in there with them. we have to save dent!

tt0468569,"02:05:16,037","02:05:19,406",Looks like clowns and hostages on two floors.
tt0468569,"02:05:19,582","02:05:21,990",There's a swa t team on the stairwell.
tt0468569,"02:05:25,296","02:05:27,918",Another swa t team on the roof.
tt0468569,"02:05:29,467","02:05:30,665",Line's clear.
tt0468569,"02:05:32,428","02:05:35,133","- barbara, calm down. - he has the kids!"

tt0468569,"02:05:39,352","02:05:42,555",- where's my family? - where my family died.
tt0468569,"02:05:45,650","02:05:47,310","Blue team, acquire the target."
tt0468569,"02:05:48,987","02:05:51,560","Entry team, set your charge."
tt0468569,"02:06:07,505","02:06:09,332","Fox, the swa ts are targeting the wrong people."
tt0468569,"02:06:09,507","02:06:11,001",The clowns are the hostages.
tt0468569,"02:06:11,718","02:06:13,509","Red team, go! red team, go!"
tt0468569,"02:06:17,265","02:06:18,676","Entry team, blow and go!"
tt0468569,"02:06:22,770","02:06:24,181",Don't move.
tt0468569,"02:06:25,356","02:06:26,732",Take the shot.
tt0468569,"02:06:32,363","02:06:34,023",Those swats are coming in hot.
tt0468569,"02:06:34,198","02:06:36,025","Clowns, put down your guns."
tt0468569,"02:06:36,534","02:06:39,155","Drop your weapons! on the ground, now!"
tt0468569,"02:06:39,370","02:06:42,537","Doctors, get down! clear the line of fire. drop your weap..."

tt0468569,"02:07:08,483","02:07:10,855",Stand down or you will be...
tt0468569,"02:07:14,405","02:07:15,864",Look up.
tt0468569,"02:07:16,449","02:07:19,022",See those bad guys on the floor above?
tt0468569,"02:07:19,202","02:07:22,203",They're waiting to ambush the swat team coming up the elevator.
tt0468569,"02:07:22,664","02:07:23,695",Sixty seconds.
tt0468569,"02:07:32,006","02:07:36,585","The tally is 140 against, 396 for."
tt0468569,"02:07:44,727","02:07:47,265",So go ahead. do it.
tt0468569,"02:07:47,438","02:07:49,431",We're still here.
tt0468569,"02:07:50,608","02:07:53,562",And that means they haven't killed us yet either.
tt0468569,"02:07:55,029","02:07:56,773","Go, go, go!"
tt0468569,"02:07:56,948","02:07:58,739","Blue team, cover!"
tt0468569,"02:08:04,247","02:08:05,907",Trouble on the floor above.
tt0468569,"02:08:15,258","02:08:16,633",Get down on the ground now!
tt0468569,"02:08:25,059","02:08:27,467",Freeze! stop or we will shoot.
tt0468569,"02:08:27,645","02:08:29,638",We will shoot you. drop the officer.
tt0468569,"02:08:29,814","02:08:31,356",Release the officer right now.
tt0468569,"02:08:31,524","02:08:33,481",Let him go now! on your knees!
tt0468569,"02:08:34,068","02:08:36,144",We got him. he's out of the game.
tt0468569,"02:08:36,321","02:08:38,812",Keep your hands in the air! step away from the edge!
tt0468569,"02:08:46,873","02:08:48,497",Halt!
tt0468569,"02:09:01,804","02:09:03,180",Stay down! don't move!
tt0468569,"02:09:03,348","02:09:07,641","Be advised. clowns are hostages, doctors are targets."
tt0468569,"02:09:13,941","02:09:16,100","Ah, you made it. I'm so thrilled."
tt0468569,"02:09:16,277","02:09:19,444",- where's the detonator? - go get him.
tt0468569,"02:09:32,835","02:09:35,920",Put down your weapon! don't move!
tt0468569,"02:10:07,328","02:10:09,202",You don't wanna die...
tt0468569,"02:10:09,372","02:10:12,408",...but you don't know how to take a life.
tt0468569,"02:10:12,583","02:10:14,243",Give it to me.
tt0468569,"02:10:14,544","02:10:18,873",These men will kill you and take it anyway.
tt0468569,"02:10:22,302","02:10:24,793",No one wants to get their hands dirty.
tt0468569,"02:10:24,971","02:10:27,925",Fine. I'll do it.
tt0468569,"02:10:29,600","02:10:32,305",Those men on that boat? they made their choices.
tt0468569,"02:10:32,478","02:10:34,767",They chose to murder and steal.
tt0468569,"02:10:34,939","02:10:38,142",It doesn't make any sense for us to have to die too.
tt0468569,"02:10:47,618","02:10:50,074",All the old familiar places.
tt0468569,"02:10:56,377","02:10:57,456",Stand by.
tt0468569,"02:11:07,805","02:11:11,388","Red team, floor secure. hostages are safe."
tt0468569,"02:11:11,601","02:11:13,677",Give it to me.
tt0468569,"02:11:15,104","02:11:18,853",You can tell them I took it by force.
tt0468569,"02:11:19,359","02:11:24,270","Give it to me, and I'll do what you should've did 10 minutes ago."
tt0468569,"02:11:46,344","02:11:49,677","We really should stop this fighting, otherwise we'll miss the fireworks."
tt0468569,"02:11:49,847","02:11:51,674",There won't be any fireworks.
tt0468569,"02:11:52,100","02:11:55,303",And here we go.
tt0468569,"02:12:34,642","02:12:36,551",What were you trying to prove?
tt0468569,"02:12:36,728","02:12:39,682","That deep down, everyone's as ugly as you?"
tt0468569,"02:12:40,815","02:12:41,846",You're alone.
tt0468569,"02:12:48,448","02:12:50,766",Can't rely on anyone these days.
tt0468569,"02:12:50,767","02:12:53,952",You gotta do everything yourself. don't we
tt0468569,"02:12:54,162","02:12:56,997",That's okay. I came prepared.
tt0468569,"02:12:57,206","02:12:58,858",It's a funny world we live in.
tt0468569,"02:12:58,859","02:13:01,667","Speaking of which, you know how I got these scars"
tt0468569,"02:13:01,836","02:13:04,671","No, but I know how you got these."
tt0468569,"02:13:22,482","02:13:25,233","Oh, you."
tt0468569,"02:13:25,401","02:13:28,438","You just couldn't let me go, could you?"
tt0468569,"02:13:29,572","02:13:33,486",This is what happens when an unstoppable force...
tt0468569,"02:13:33,660","02:13:38,120",...meets an immovable object.
tt0468569,"02:13:38,706","02:13:44,127","You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?"
tt0468569,"02:13:44,295","02:13:47,000",Huh? you won't kill me...
tt0468569,"02:13:47,173","02:13:53,425",...out of some misplaced sense of self-righteousness.
tt0468569,"02:13:53,596","02:13:56,799",And I won't kill you...
tt0468569,"02:13:56,975","02:14:00,759",...because you're just too much fun.
tt0468569,"02:14:01,813","02:14:05,976",I think you and I are destined to do this forever.
tt0468569,"02:14:06,150","02:14:08,143",You'll be in a padded cell forever.
tt0468569,"02:14:08,319","02:14:10,146",Maybe we could share one.
tt0468569,"02:14:10,321","02:14:11,780","You know, they'll be doubling up..."
tt0468569,"02:14:11,948","02:14:14,486",...the rate this city's inhabitants are losing their minds.
tt0468569,"02:14:14,659","02:14:17,779",This city just showed you...
tt0468569,"02:14:17,954","02:14:21,998",...that it's full of people ready to believe in good.
tt0468569,"02:14:22,166","02:14:25,333",Until their spirit breaks completely.
tt0468569,"02:14:26,212","02:14:31,040",Until they get a good look at the real harvey dent...
tt0468569,"02:14:31,217","02:14:34,004",...and all the heroic things he's done.
tt0468569,"02:14:35,680","02:14:40,721",You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle for gotham's soul...
tt0468569,"02:14:40,893","02:14:43,811",...in a fistfight with you?
tt0468569,"02:14:44,355","02:14:45,897",No.
tt0468569,"02:14:46,065","02:14:49,481",You need an ace in the hole.
tt0468569,"02:14:49,652","02:14:51,277",Mine's harvey.
tt0468569,"02:14:51,654","02:14:53,362",What did you do?
tt0468569,"02:14:53,531","02:14:56,532",I took gotham's white knight...
tt0468569,"02:14:56,701","02:15:00,319",...and I brought him down to our level.
tt0468569,"02:15:00,747","02:15:03,701","It wasn't hard. see, madness, as you know..."
tt0468569,"02:15:03,875","02:15:06,911",...is like gravity.
tt0468569,"02:15:07,086","02:15:09,412",All it takes is a little push.
tt0468569,"02:15:26,356","02:15:28,099",Dent!
tt0468569,"02:15:49,087","02:15:53,416","This is where they brought her, gordon, after your men handed her over."
tt0468569,"02:15:54,175","02:15:55,753",This is where she died.
tt0468569,"02:15:55,927","02:15:58,252","I know, I was here..."
tt0468569,"02:15:59,305","02:16:02,057",...trying to save her. - but you didn't.
tt0468569,"02:16:02,350","02:16:04,093","- I couldn't. - yes, you could've."
tt0468569,"02:16:04,268","02:16:05,763",If you'd listened to me.
tt0468569,"02:16:05,937","02:16:08,558",If you stood up against corruption...
tt0468569,"02:16:08,731","02:16:10,938",...instead of doing your deal with the devil.
tt0468569,"02:16:11,109","02:16:12,733",I was trying to fight the mob!
tt0468569,"02:16:13,236","02:16:18,064",You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself if you knew what I'd lost.
tt0468569,"02:16:19,367","02:16:22,487",Have you ever had to talk to the person you loved most...
tt0468569,"02:16:22,662","02:16:26,529","...tell them it's gonna be all right, when you know it's not?"
tt0468569,"02:16:28,209","02:16:32,076","Well, you're about to know what that feels like, gordon."
tt0468569,"02:16:32,839","02:16:36,706",Then you can look me in the eye and tell me you're sorry.
tt0468569,"02:16:38,469","02:16:42,052",- you're not going to hurt my family. - no.
tt0468569,"02:16:42,223","02:16:44,928",Just the person you love most.
tt0468569,"02:16:52,942","02:16:55,979",So is it your wife?
tt0468569,"02:16:57,071","02:16:58,731","Put the gun down, harvey."
tt0468569,"02:16:59,115","02:17:00,775","Harvey, put down the gun."
tt0468569,"02:17:00,950","02:17:04,485","Please. please, harvey. please."
tt0468569,"02:17:05,872","02:17:07,152","Oh, goddamn it."
tt0468569,"02:17:07,332","02:17:09,490",Will you stop pointing that gun at my family?
tt0468569,"02:17:10,001","02:17:11,661",No! - we have a winner.
tt0468569,"02:17:11,836","02:17:13,330","No, jim, stop him!"
tt0468569,"02:17:13,838","02:17:15,665",Harvey. don't let him...
tt0468569,"02:17:15,840","02:17:16,955",Harvey!
tt0468569,"02:17:18,343","02:17:20,216",I'm sorry!
tt0468569,"02:17:22,013","02:17:23,092",For everything.
tt0468569,"02:17:25,683","02:17:27,890",Please don't hurt my son.
tt0468569,"02:17:38,029","02:17:39,607",You brought your cops?
tt0468569,"02:17:39,781","02:17:42,651",All they know is there's a situation.
tt0468569,"02:17:42,825","02:17:45,826",They don't know who or what. they're just creating a perimeter.
tt0468569,"02:17:45,995","02:17:48,665",You think I wanna escape from this?
tt0468569,"02:17:48,831","02:17:51,583",There is no escape from this.
tt0468569,"02:17:51,751","02:17:53,874","You don't wanna hurt the boy, harvey."
tt0468569,"02:17:56,172","02:17:59,375","It's not about what I want, it's about what's fair!"
tt0468569,"02:18:00,134","02:18:04,346",You thought we could be decent men in an indecent time.
tt0468569,"02:18:07,141","02:18:08,221",But you were wrong.
tt0468569,"02:18:08,935","02:18:12,719",The world is cruel. and the only morality in a cruel world...
tt0468569,"02:18:13,481","02:18:15,390",...is chance.
tt0468569,"02:18:15,566","02:18:17,274",Unbiased.
tt0468569,"02:18:17,485","02:18:18,730",Unprejudiced.
tt0468569,"02:18:20,113","02:18:21,227",Fair.
tt0468569,"02:18:21,406","02:18:23,647",His son's got the same chance she had.
tt0468569,"02:18:24,409","02:18:25,689",Fifty-fifty.
tt0468569,"02:18:25,868","02:18:29,320",What happened to rachel wasn't chance. we decided to act.
tt0468569,"02:18:29,664","02:18:30,992",We three.
tt0468569,"02:18:31,165","02:18:34,581",Then why was it me who was the only one who lost everything?
tt0468569,"02:18:37,088","02:18:39,709",- it wasn't. - the joker chose me.
tt0468569,"02:18:39,882","02:18:42,171",Because you were the best of us.
tt0468569,"02:18:42,343","02:18:47,338",He wanted to prove that even someone as good as you...
tt0468569,"02:18:47,515","02:18:49,258",...could fall.
tt0468569,"02:18:49,600","02:18:50,881",And he was right.
tt0468569,"02:18:51,060","02:18:53,302","You're the one pointing the gun, harvey."
tt0468569,"02:18:53,479","02:18:56,516",So point it at the people responsible.
tt0468569,"02:18:57,483","02:18:59,310",Fair enough.
tt0468569,"02:19:02,655","02:19:04,529",You first.
tt0468569,"02:19:17,045","02:19:18,705",My turn.
tt0468569,"02:19:25,637","02:19:27,629","Harvey, you're right."
tt0468569,"02:19:28,681","02:19:31,303",Rachel's death was my fault.
tt0468569,"02:19:34,395","02:19:36,851",Please don't punish the boy.
tt0468569,"02:19:37,940","02:19:41,144","- please, punish me. - I'm about to."
tt0468569,"02:19:43,112","02:19:45,069","Tell your boy he's gonna be all right, gordon."
tt0468569,"02:19:45,531","02:19:47,156",Lie...
tt0468569,"02:19:47,659","02:19:48,773",...like I lied.
tt0468569,"02:19:52,538","02:19:54,116","It's going to be all right, son."
tt0468569,"02:20:32,537","02:20:35,372","Dad? daddy, is he okay?"
tt0468569,"02:20:51,889","02:20:54,048",- thank you. - you don't have to thank me.
tt0468569,"02:20:54,684","02:20:56,475","Yes, I do."
tt0468569,"02:21:00,732","02:21:02,060",The joker won.
tt0468569,"02:21:04,485","02:21:07,356","Harvey's prosecution, everything he fought for..."
tt0468569,"02:21:07,905","02:21:09,649",...undone.
tt0468569,"02:21:10,158","02:21:12,517",Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
tt0468569,"02:21:12,518","02:21:15,069",Our city dies with harvey's reputation
tt0468569,"02:21:15,246","02:21:16,409",We bet it all on him.
tt0468569,"02:21:17,749","02:21:20,619",The joker took the best of us and tore him down.
tt0468569,"02:21:21,210","02:21:22,621",People will lose hope.
tt0468569,"02:21:22,795","02:21:24,539",They won't.
tt0468569,"02:21:27,050","02:21:28,923",They must never know what he did.
tt0468569,"02:21:29,093","02:21:30,920",Five dead.
tt0468569,"02:21:31,220","02:21:32,501",Two of them cops.
tt0468569,"02:21:32,680","02:21:35,136",- you can't sweep that... - no.
tt0468569,"02:21:39,937","02:21:42,773",But the joker cannot win.
tt0468569,"02:21:48,029","02:21:51,232",Gotham needs its true hero.
tt0468569,"02:21:57,622","02:22:00,658",#NAME?
tt0468569,"02:22:00,833","02:22:05,294",...or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
tt0468569,"02:22:05,463","02:22:07,290",I can do those things...
tt0468569,"02:22:07,715","02:22:10,752","...because I'm not a hero, not like dent."
tt0468569,"02:22:13,763","02:22:16,634",I killed those people. that's what I can be.
tt0468569,"02:22:16,808","02:22:18,717","No, no, you can't. you're not."
tt0468569,"02:22:18,893","02:22:21,467",I'm whatever gotham needs me to be.
tt0468569,"02:22:23,147","02:22:24,262",Call it in.
tt0468569,"02:22:27,568","02:22:29,312",A hero.
tt0468569,"02:22:29,487","02:22:32,737","Not the hero we deserved, but the hero we needed."
tt0468569,"02:22:33,324","02:22:35,862",Nothing less than a knight...
tt0468569,"02:22:36,411","02:22:38,119",...shining.
tt0468569,"02:22:38,746","02:22:40,371",They'll hunt you.
tt0468569,"02:22:40,540","02:22:42,331",You'll hunt me.
tt0468569,"02:22:42,834","02:22:44,791",You'll condemn me.
tt0468569,"02:22:45,503","02:22:47,792",Set the dogs on me.
tt0468569,"02:22:51,551","02:22:53,839",Because that's what needs to happen.
tt0468569,"02:22:55,013","02:22:56,922",Because sometimes...
tt0468569,"02:22:57,098","02:22:59,256",... the truth isn 't good enough.
tt0468569,"02:23:00,143","02:23:02,431",Sometimes people deserve more.
tt0468569,"02:23:05,898","02:23:09,813",Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded.
tt0468569,"02:23:28,212","02:23:29,872",Batman.
tt0468569,"02:23:31,799","02:23:33,543",Batman!
tt0468569,"02:23:34,344","02:23:36,301","Why's he running, dad?"
tt0468569,"02:23:37,347","02:23:38,675",Because we have to chase him.
tt0468569,"02:23:38,848","02:23:41,719","Okay, we're going in! go, go! move!"
tt0468569,"02:23:47,815","02:23:49,393",He didn't do anything wrong.
tt0468569,"02:23:52,153","02:23:57,740","Because he's the hero gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now."
tt0468569,"02:23:59,160","02:24:00,191",So we'll hunt him...
tt0468569,"02:24:03,331","02:24:05,407",... because he can take it.
tt0468569,"02:24:07,919","02:24:10,410",Because he's not our hero.
tt0468569,"02:24:17,971","02:24:19,169",He's a silent guardian...
tt0468569,"02:24:20,348","02:24:22,222",...a watchful protector.
tt0468569,"02:24:24,727","02:24:26,008",A dark knight.
tt0068646,"00:01:16,820","00:01:19,660",I believe in America.
tt0068646,"00:01:19,740","00:01:22,700",America has made my fortune.
tt0068646,"00:01:22,790","00:01:26,920",And I raised my daughter in the American fashion.
tt0068646,"00:01:27,000","00:01:31,840","I gave her freedom, but I taught her never to dishonor her family."
tt0068646,"00:01:33,300","00:01:36,420","She found a boyfriend, not an Italian."
tt0068646,"00:01:36,510","00:01:40,930",She went to the movies with him. She stayed out late.
tt0068646,"00:01:41,010","00:01:42,720",I didn't protest.
tt0068646,"00:01:43,810","00:01:48,520",Two months ago he took her for a drive with another boyfriend.
tt0068646,"00:01:49,560","00:01:52,190",They made her drink whiskey
tt0068646,"00:01:52,270","00:01:56,650",and then they tried to take advantage of her.
tt0068646,"00:01:56,740","00:02:00,870","She resisted, she kept her honor."
tt0068646,"00:02:02,200","00:02:05,200",So they beat her like an animal.
tt0068646,"00:02:07,040","00:02:12,000","When I went to the hospital, her nose was broken,"
tt0068646,"00:02:12,090","00:02:16,550","her jaw was shattered, held together by wire."
tt0068646,"00:02:18,760","00:02:22,180",She couldn't even weep because of the pain.
tt0068646,"00:02:24,220","00:02:27,730",But I wept. Why did I weep?
tt0068646,"00:02:30,400","00:02:32,730",She was the light of my life.
tt0068646,"00:02:34,690","00:02:36,400",Beautiful girl.
tt0068646,"00:02:40,070","00:02:43,030",Now she will never be beautiful again.
tt0068646,"00:02:49,580","00:02:50,960",Sorry.
tt0068646,"00:02:59,260","00:03:03,930","I went to the police, like a good American."
tt0068646,"00:03:04,010","00:03:06,680",These two boys were brought to trial.
tt0068646,"00:03:07,770","00:03:10,560","The judge sentenced them to three years in prison,"
tt0068646,"00:03:10,640","00:03:12,770",but suspended the sentence.
tt0068646,"00:03:13,940","00:03:18,940",Suspended the sentence! They went free that very day!
tt0068646,"00:03:21,240","00:03:24,530",I stood in the courtroom like a fool.
tt0068646,"00:03:24,620","00:03:28,120","Those two bastards, they smiled at me."
tt0068646,"00:03:29,370","00:03:34,960","Then I said to my wife, ""For justice, we must go to Don Corleone."""
tt0068646,"00:03:40,380","00:03:44,760",Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first?
tt0068646,"00:03:44,890","00:03:50,980","What do you want of me? Tell me anything, but do what I beg you to do."
tt0068646,"00:03:51,060","00:03:52,730",What is that?
tt0068646,"00:04:03,860","00:04:05,700",I want them dead.
tt0068646,"00:04:17,340","00:04:19,130",That I cannot do.
tt0068646,"00:04:20,460","00:04:22,970",I'll give you anything you ask.
tt0068646,"00:04:25,260","00:04:30,890","I've known you many years, but this is the first time you've asked for help."
tt0068646,"00:04:32,060","00:04:37,110",I can't remember the last time you invited me for a cup of coffee.
tt0068646,"00:04:38,270","00:04:42,030",Even though my wife is godmother to your only child.
tt0068646,"00:04:42,110","00:04:47,120",But let's be Frank here. You never wanted my friendship.
tt0068646,"00:04:47,200","00:04:50,950",And you were afraid to be in my debt.
tt0068646,"00:04:51,040","00:04:53,450",I didn't want to get into trouble.
tt0068646,"00:04:54,580","00:04:56,210",I understand.
tt0068646,"00:04:57,710","00:05:00,590",You found Paradise in America.
tt0068646,"00:05:02,880","00:05:07,550","You made a good living, had police protection and there were courts of law."
tt0068646,"00:05:07,640","00:05:10,350",You didn't need a friend like me.
tt0068646,"00:05:11,890","00:05:15,560","But now you come to me and say,"
tt0068646,"00:05:15,640","00:05:18,060","""Don Corleone, give me justice."""
tt0068646,"00:05:19,980","00:05:22,820",But you don't ask with respect.
tt0068646,"00:05:22,900","00:05:27,610",You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather.
tt0068646,"00:05:29,320","00:05:36,210",You come on my daughter's wedding day and ask me to murder for money.
tt0068646,"00:05:36,290","00:05:38,830",I ask you for justice.
tt0068646,"00:05:38,920","00:05:41,920",That is not justice. Your daughter is alive.
tt0068646,"00:05:42,960","00:05:46,420","Let them suffer, then, as she suffers."
tt0068646,"00:05:48,550","00:05:50,850",How much shall I pay you?
tt0068646,"00:06:05,530","00:06:09,450","Bonasera, Bonasera."
tt0068646,"00:06:09,530","00:06:13,620",What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully?
tt0068646,"00:06:14,740","00:06:17,290","If you'd come in friendship,"
tt0068646,"00:06:17,370","00:06:21,790",the scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day.
tt0068646,"00:06:22,920","00:06:28,090","And if an honest man like you should make enemies, they'd be my enemies."
tt0068646,"00:06:31,010","00:06:33,850",And then they would fear you.
tt0068646,"00:06:37,350","00:06:39,480",Be my friend?
tt0068646,"00:06:43,440","00:06:44,980",Godfather?
tt0068646,"00:06:49,320","00:06:50,530",Good.
tt0068646,"00:06:52,660","00:06:57,830","Some day, and that day may never come, I'll ask a service of you."
tt0068646,"00:06:59,210","00:07:01,330",But until that day
tt0068646,"00:07:03,130","00:07:07,420",accept this justice as a gift on my daughter's wedding day.
tt0068646,"00:07:07,510","00:07:09,920","- Gràzie, Godfather. - Prego."
tt0068646,"00:07:16,970","00:07:19,680",Give this to Clemenza.
tt0068646,"00:07:21,980","00:07:25,440",I want people that aren't going to get carried away.

tt0068646,"00:29:32,850","00:29:34,350",Check him out.
tt0068646,"00:29:56,870","00:29:59,420",- It's really beautiful. - Look at this.
tt0068646,"00:29:59,500","00:30:04,010",- It used to decorate a King's palace. - Very nice.
tt0068646,"00:30:04,090","00:30:06,470",Why didn't you say you work for Corleone?
tt0068646,"00:30:06,590","00:30:10,800",I thought you were some cheap hustler Johnny was running in.
tt0068646,"00:30:10,890","00:30:14,220",- I only use his name when necessary. - How's your drink?
tt0068646,"00:30:14,350","00:30:17,810",- Fine. - Now I'll show you something beautiful.
tt0068646,"00:30:17,890","00:30:20,480","You do appreciate beauty, don't you?"
tt0068646,"00:30:23,440","00:30:26,490","There you are. $600,000 on four hoofs."
tt0068646,"00:30:26,570","00:30:30,530",I bet Russian czars never paid that for a single horse.
tt0068646,"00:30:30,620","00:30:32,160",Khartoum.
tt0068646,"00:30:32,780","00:30:34,080",Khartoum.
tt0068646,"00:30:35,620","00:30:40,000","I'm not going to race him, though. I'm going to put him out to stud."
tt0068646,"00:30:41,580","00:30:43,130","Thanks, Tony."
tt0068646,"00:30:43,920","00:30:46,840",Let's get something to eat.
tt0068646,"00:30:46,920","00:30:50,340",Corleone is Johnny's godfather.
tt0068646,"00:30:50,430","00:30:54,850","To the Italian people that's a very sacred, close relationship."
tt0068646,"00:30:54,930","00:30:58,850",I respect it. Tell him to ask me anything else.
tt0068646,"00:30:58,940","00:31:01,270",This favor I can't give him.
tt0068646,"00:31:01,350","00:31:04,650",He never asks a second favor when he's been refused the first.
tt0068646,"00:31:04,770","00:31:10,910",You don't understand. Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.
tt0068646,"00:31:10,990","00:31:14,660",That part is perfect for him. It'll make him a big star.
tt0068646,"00:31:14,780","00:31:18,870","I'm going to run him out of the business, and let me tell you why."
tt0068646,"00:31:20,870","00:31:25,550",Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz International's most valuable protégés.
tt0068646,"00:31:25,630","00:31:31,010","We trained her for five years. Singing, acting, dancing lessons."
tt0068646,"00:31:31,130","00:31:35,720","I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on her, to make her a big star."
tt0068646,"00:31:35,810","00:31:38,600",Let me be even more Frank.
tt0068646,"00:31:38,680","00:31:41,185",To show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man.
tt0068646,"00:31:41,186","00:31:43,690",That it's not all dollars and cents.
tt0068646,"00:31:43,770","00:31:47,400",She was beautiful. She was young and innocent!
tt0068646,"00:31:47,480","00:31:52,910",She's the greatest piece of ass I've had and I've had them all over the world.
tt0068646,"00:31:52,990","00:31:59,120",Then Johnny Fontane comes along with his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.
tt0068646,"00:31:59,200","00:32:00,910",And she runs off.
tt0068646,"00:32:02,250","00:32:06,340",She threw it all away just to make me look ridiculous!
tt0068646,"00:32:06,420","00:32:11,590",And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous!
tt0068646,"00:32:11,670","00:32:14,010",You get the hell out of here!
tt0068646,"00:32:14,090","00:32:18,470","If that goombah tries any rough stuff, tell him I'm no bandleader."
tt0068646,"00:32:19,770","00:32:22,770","Yeah, I heard that story."
tt0068646,"00:32:23,600","00:32:27,610",Thank you for dinner and a very pleasant evening.
tt0068646,"00:32:27,690","00:32:30,570",Maybe your car can take me to the airport.
tt0068646,"00:32:30,650","00:32:34,240",Mr. Corleone insists on hearing bad news immediately.
tt0068646,"00:34:26,930","00:34:30,860","- You're not too tired, are you, Tom? - No, I slept on the plane."
tt0068646,"00:34:30,940","00:34:34,030",I have the Sollozzo notes here.
tt0068646,"00:34:34,110","00:34:35,360",Now...
tt0068646,"00:34:37,320","00:34:40,910",Sollozzo is known as The Turk.
tt0068646,"00:34:40,990","00:34:42,950","He's supposed to be very good with a knife,"
tt0068646,"00:34:43,030","00:34:47,460",but only in matters of business with reasonable complaint.
tt0068646,"00:34:47,540","00:34:50,790",His business is narcotics.
tt0068646,"00:34:50,880","00:34:54,250","He has fields in Turkey, where they grow poppy."
tt0068646,"00:34:54,340","00:34:58,170",In Sicily he has plants to process them into heroin.
tt0068646,"00:34:58,260","00:35:01,760","He needs cash, he needs protection from the police."
tt0068646,"00:35:01,840","00:35:05,770",He'll give a piece of the action. I don't know how much.
tt0068646,"00:35:05,890","00:35:11,100",The Tattaglia family is behind him here. They have to be in it for something.
tt0068646,"00:35:12,400","00:35:16,980",#NAME?
tt0068646,"00:35:17,070","00:35:19,820",He's known as a top narcotics man.
tt0068646,"00:35:19,900","00:35:24,580",#NAME?
tt0068646,"00:35:26,910","00:35:28,290",Tom?
tt0068646,"00:35:28,370","00:35:32,540",Yes. There's more money in narcotics than anything else.
tt0068646,"00:35:32,630","00:35:37,380","If we don't get into it, somebody else will, maybe the five families."
tt0068646,"00:35:37,460","00:35:41,930",With that money they can buy more police and political power.
tt0068646,"00:35:42,010","00:35:44,100",Then they come after us.
tt0068646,"00:35:44,220","00:35:50,730","Now we have unions and gambling, and that's great, but narcotics is the future."
tt0068646,"00:35:50,810","00:35:55,940","If we don't get a piece of that action, we risk everything in 10 years' time."
tt0068646,"00:36:00,490","00:36:03,570","So? What's your answer going to be, Pop?"
tt0068646,"00:36:08,330","00:36:10,080",Don Corleone.
tt0068646,"00:36:12,170","00:36:15,460",I need a man who has powerful friends.
tt0068646,"00:36:15,590","00:36:18,300",I need a million dollars in cash.
tt0068646,"00:36:18,380","00:36:24,220","I need those politicians that you carry in your pocket, like nickels and dimes."
tt0068646,"00:36:25,680","00:36:29,680",- What is the interest for my family? - 30%.
tt0068646,"00:36:29,770","00:36:33,730","In the first year your end should be three, four million dollars."
tt0068646,"00:36:33,810","00:36:35,810",And then it would go up.
tt0068646,"00:36:37,020","00:36:40,440",And what is the interest for the Tattaglia family?
tt0068646,"00:36:42,450","00:36:44,280",My compliments.
tt0068646,"00:36:47,950","00:36:51,370","I'll take care of them, out of my share."
tt0068646,"00:36:51,450","00:36:55,750","So I receive 30% for finance,"
tt0068646,"00:36:55,830","00:36:59,170",political influence and legal protection?
tt0068646,"00:36:59,250","00:37:00,960",That's right.
tt0068646,"00:37:02,260","00:37:06,180",Why do you come to me? Why do I deserve this generosity?
tt0068646,"00:37:06,260","00:37:11,560","If you consider a million dollars in cash just finance,"
tt0068646,"00:37:11,640","00:37:13,810",te salud Don Corleone.
tt0068646,"00:37:24,320","00:37:29,580","I said that I would see you, because I heard you were a serious man,"
tt0068646,"00:37:29,660","00:37:31,910",to be treated with respect.
tt0068646,"00:37:36,580","00:37:39,880","But, I must say no to you."
tt0068646,"00:37:41,050","00:37:43,880",And I'll give you my reason.
tt0068646,"00:37:43,970","00:37:46,800","It's true, I have a lot of friends in politics."
tt0068646,"00:37:48,050","00:37:52,470","They wouldn't be friendly long if I was involved in drugs instead of gambling,"
tt0068646,"00:37:52,560","00:37:58,190","which they regard as a harmless vice, but drugs is a dirty business."
tt0068646,"00:37:58,270","00:38:03,280",It doesn't make any difference to me what a man does for a living.
tt0068646,"00:38:03,360","00:38:08,610",But your business is... a little dangerous.
tt0068646,"00:38:08,700","00:38:13,120","If you're worried about security, the Tattaglias will guarantee it."
tt0068646,"00:38:13,200","00:38:16,710",#NAME?
tt0068646,"00:38:24,010","00:38:28,800","I have a sentimental weakness for my children, and I spoil them."
tt0068646,"00:38:28,880","00:38:32,140",They talk when they should listen. But anyway...
tt0068646,"00:38:32,260","00:38:37,640","Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to congratulate you on your new business."
tt0068646,"00:38:37,730","00:38:41,190","I know you'll do well, and good luck."
tt0068646,"00:38:41,270","00:38:46,110",Especially since your interests don't conflict with mine. Thank you.
tt0068646,"00:39:06,760","00:39:08,670",Santino.
tt0068646,"00:39:08,760","00:39:10,590",Come here.
tt0068646,"00:39:12,930","00:39:14,850",What's the matter with you?
tt0068646,"00:39:14,930","00:39:19,560",Your brain is going soft from playing with that girl.
tt0068646,"00:39:19,640","00:39:23,770",Never tell anybody outside the family what you're thinking again.
tt0068646,"00:39:25,070","00:39:26,320",Go on.
tt0068646,"00:39:30,280","00:39:33,120","Tom, what's this nonsense?"
tt0068646,"00:39:33,200","00:39:36,620",It's from Johnny. He's starring in that new film.
tt0068646,"00:39:38,950","00:39:41,540",#NAME?
tt0068646,"00:39:42,830","00:39:44,380",And
tt0068646,"00:39:45,420","00:39:47,590",tell Luca Brasi to come in.
tt0068646,"00:39:53,720","00:39:57,140",I'm a little worried about this Sollozzo fellow.
tt0068646,"00:39:57,220","00:40:00,180",Find out what he's got under his fingernails.
tt0068646,"00:40:01,190","00:40:04,810",Go to the Tattaglias.
tt0068646,"00:40:04,900","00:40:09,190",Make them think that you're not too happy with our family
tt0068646,"00:40:10,570","00:40:12,950",and find out what you can.
tt0068646,"00:40:30,420","00:40:33,720",I got something for your mother and for Sonny
tt0068646,"00:40:33,800","00:40:38,470","and a tie for Freddy, and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen."
tt0068646,"00:40:38,560","00:40:41,810",#NAME?
tt0068646,"00:41:13,720","00:41:15,630","Andiamo, Fredo."
tt0068646,"00:41:15,720","00:41:19,140",#NAME?
tt0068646,"00:41:19,220","00:41:23,230",I'll have to get it myself. Paulie called in sick this morning.
tt0068646,"00:41:24,980","00:41:28,230",Paulie's a good kid. I don't mind getting the car.
tt0068646,"00:41:31,650","00:41:33,820","Buon natale, Caro. Gràzie."
tt0068646,"00:42:16,450","00:42:20,740",- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia. - I know.
tt0068646,"00:42:30,670","00:42:31,670",You know who I am?
tt0068646,"00:42:31,750","00:42:33,090",I know you.
tt0068646,"00:42:34,380","00:42:37,970",You have been talking to the Tattaglia family... right?
tt0068646,"00:42:38,970","00:42:42,970",I think you and I can do business.
tt0068646,"00:42:44,810","00:42:47,480",I need someone strong like you.
tt0068646,"00:42:48,100","00:42:50,940",I heard you are not happy...
tt0068646,"00:42:51,360","00:42:53,650",with the Corleone family.
tt0068646,"00:42:54,400","00:42:56,150",Want to join me?
tt0068646,"00:42:57,320","00:42:59,280",What's in it for me?
tt0068646,"00:43:01,910","00:43:04,830","$50,000 to start with."
tt0068646,"00:43:06,830","00:43:08,080",Not bad!
tt0068646,"00:43:09,750","00:43:11,380",Agreed?
tt0068646,"00:44:10,810","00:44:14,520",Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.
tt0068646,"00:44:14,650","00:44:19,570",- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you. - I haven't got time.
tt0068646,"00:44:19,650","00:44:22,700","Make time, Consigliere. Get in the car."
tt0068646,"00:44:24,530","00:44:29,040","What are you worried about? If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already."
tt0068646,"00:44:29,120","00:44:30,580",Get in.
tt0068646,"00:44:41,590","00:44:45,300","- Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit. - Okay, Pop."
tt0068646,"00:44:52,100","00:44:54,940",Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.
tt0068646,"00:46:22,480","00:46:26,530",Would you like me better if I were a nun? Like in the story.
tt0068646,"00:46:29,660","00:46:30,660",No.
tt0068646,"00:46:30,740","00:46:35,120","- What if I were Ingrid Bergman? - Now, that's a thought."
tt0068646,"00:46:37,710","00:46:39,670",Michael.
tt0068646,"00:46:39,750","00:46:42,170","No, I wouldn't like you better if you were Ingrid Bergman."
tt0068646,"00:46:42,250","00:46:44,050",What's the matter?
tt0068646,"00:47:00,940","00:47:03,610",They don't say if he's dead or alive.
tt0068646,"00:47:25,880","00:47:29,170","- Sonny, it's Michael. - Where have you been?"
tt0068646,"00:47:29,260","00:47:32,010",- Is he all right? - We don't know yet.
tt0068646,"00:47:32,090","00:47:36,140","There are all kinds of stories. He was hit bad, Mikey."
tt0068646,"00:47:38,100","00:47:41,350","- Are you there? - Yeah, I'm here."
tt0068646,"00:47:41,480","00:47:46,360",- Where have you been? I was worried. - Didn't Tom tell you I called?
tt0068646,"00:47:46,440","00:47:50,490","No. Look, come home, kid. You should be with Mama, you hear?"
tt0068646,"00:47:57,950","00:47:59,540","Oh, my God."
tt0068646,"00:48:03,540","00:48:04,960",Sonny!
tt0068646,"00:48:13,840","00:48:16,140",Stay back there.
tt0068646,"00:48:16,220","00:48:18,890","- Who is it? - Open up, it's Clemenza."

tt0068646,"00:49:14,110","00:49:17,450",Listen to what he has to say before you do anything.
tt0068646,"00:49:17,530","00:49:22,160","What's done is done. Don't lose that famous temper of yours, Sonny."
tt0068646,"00:49:22,250","00:49:23,960",I'll wait.
tt0068646,"00:49:38,300","00:49:40,310",Your boss is dead.
tt0068646,"00:49:43,140","00:49:47,560","I know you're not in the muscle end of the family, so don't be scared."
tt0068646,"00:49:48,650","00:49:52,530",I want you to help the Corleones and me.
tt0068646,"00:49:56,490","00:50:00,990",We got him outside his office about an hour after we picked you up.
tt0068646,"00:50:02,410","00:50:03,700",Drink it.
tt0068646,"00:50:08,460","00:50:11,920",It's up to you to make peace between me and Sonny.
tt0068646,"00:50:16,130","00:50:18,930","Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?"
tt0068646,"00:50:20,300","00:50:23,140",And you knew it was the right thing to do.
tt0068646,"00:50:24,310","00:50:29,440",#NAME?
tt0068646,"00:50:30,860","00:50:37,360",So you have to talk sense into him. The Tattaglia family is behind me.
tt0068646,"00:50:37,450","00:50:42,530",The other New York families will go along with anything to prevent war.
tt0068646,"00:50:42,620","00:50:47,830","Let's face it, with all due respect, the Don rest in peace was slipping."
tt0068646,"00:50:50,830","00:50:53,840","Ten years ago, could I have gotten to him?"
tt0068646,"00:50:57,720","00:51:01,680","Well, now he's dead, Tom, and nothing can bring him back."
tt0068646,"00:51:03,470","00:51:09,350","You've got to talk to Sonny, to the Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza."
tt0068646,"00:51:14,320","00:51:16,400","It's good business, Tom."
tt0068646,"00:51:17,780","00:51:22,620",I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
tt0068646,"00:51:25,660","00:51:27,450","Yeah, well..."
tt0068646,"00:51:29,290","00:51:31,670",Let me worry about Luca.
tt0068646,"00:51:36,880","00:51:39,260",You just talk to Sonny.
tt0068646,"00:51:39,340","00:51:41,590",And the other two kids.
tt0068646,"00:51:44,550","00:51:47,060",- I'll do my best. - Good.
tt0068646,"00:51:49,430","00:51:51,850",Now you can go.
tt0068646,"00:51:58,690","00:52:03,370","I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman."
tt0068646,"00:52:03,450","00:52:05,910",Blood is a big expense.
tt0068646,"00:52:27,140","00:52:29,020",He's still alive.
tt0068646,"00:52:29,100","00:52:33,060","They hit him with five shots, and he's still alive!"
tt0068646,"00:52:33,150","00:52:37,900","That's bad luck for me, and bad luck for you if you don't make that deal."
tt0068646,"00:53:22,610","00:53:25,030",Your mother is at the hospital with your father.
tt0068646,"00:53:25,031","00:53:27,450",Looks like he'll pull through.
tt0068646,"00:53:29,280","00:53:35,920","It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon..."
tt0068646,"00:53:36,000","00:53:39,420",#NAME?
tt0068646,"00:53:39,500","00:53:41,960","If you get rid of Sollozzo, everything falls into line."
tt0068646,"00:53:42,050","00:53:46,340",What about Luca? Sollozzo thinks he can control him.
tt0068646,"00:53:46,430","00:53:50,220","If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble."
tt0068646,"00:53:50,310","00:53:53,890",- Has anyone been in touch with Luca? - We've been trying all night.
tt0068646,"00:53:53,980","00:53:58,020",#NAME?
tt0068646,"00:54:00,110","00:54:05,320","Well, Tom, you're consigliere. What do we do if the old man dies?"
tt0068646,"00:54:06,450","00:54:12,660","If we lose the old man, we lose the political contacts and half our strength."
tt0068646,"00:54:12,740","00:54:18,420",The other New York families might support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.
tt0068646,"00:54:18,500","00:54:23,050",This is almost 1946. Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.
tt0068646,"00:54:23,130","00:54:24,800",If your father dies
tt0068646,"00:54:27,220","00:54:28,970",you make the deal.
tt0068646,"00:54:29,050","00:54:33,930",- Easy to say. He's not your father. - I'm as much a son as you or Mike.
tt0068646,"00:54:38,520","00:54:40,020",What is it?
tt0068646,"00:54:41,020","00:54:46,820",#NAME?
tt0068646,"00:54:46,900","00:54:49,030","Tessio, go see what it is."
tt0068646,"00:54:52,370","00:54:54,620",#NAME?
tt0068646,"00:54:54,700","00:54:58,460",- I'm fine. - There's food. Are you hungry?

tt0068646,"00:55:02,210","00:55:04,840",#NAME?
tt0068646,"00:55:06,590","00:55:12,640",Take care of that son-of-a-bitch. Paulie sold out the old man.
tt0068646,"00:55:12,720","00:55:16,310",#NAME?
tt0068646,"00:55:16,390","00:55:20,690","Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys and go to Luca's apartment."
tt0068646,"00:55:20,770","00:55:24,480",Maybe we shouldn't get Mike mixed up in this too directly.
tt0068646,"00:55:27,030","00:55:30,740",Hanging around the house on the phone would be a big help.
tt0068646,"00:55:31,610","00:55:33,530",Try Luca again.
tt0068646,"00:55:42,460","00:55:45,210",- What's this? - A Sicilian message.
tt0068646,"00:55:45,300","00:55:48,170",It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.
tt0068646,"00:56:01,900","00:56:03,980",- I'm going. - When will you be home?
tt0068646,"00:56:04,060","00:56:05,730",Probably late.
tt0068646,"00:56:08,280","00:56:11,950","- Don't forget the cannoli! - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
tt0068646,"00:56:14,200","00:56:18,700","Rocco, sit on the other side. You block the rear-view mirror."
tt0068646,"00:56:20,250","00:56:23,670",Sonny's running wild. He wants to go to mattresses already.
tt0068646,"00:56:23,750","00:56:29,630",We have to find a spot on the West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.
tt0068646,"00:56:29,710","00:56:33,220",- Know a good spot on the West Side? - I'll think about it.
tt0068646,"00:56:33,300","00:56:37,060",Think while you're driving. I want to hit New York this month.
tt0068646,"00:56:37,140","00:56:38,890",Watch the kids.
tt0068646,"00:56:49,780","00:56:55,570","Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up 18 mattresses and bring me the bill."
tt0068646,"00:56:55,660","00:56:57,080","Yeah, all right."
tt0068646,"00:56:57,160","00:57:01,580","Make sure they're clean, because the guys will be there a long time."
tt0068646,"00:57:01,660","00:57:05,920",- They're clean and exterminated. - That's a bad word to use.
tt0068646,"00:57:06,000","00:57:09,960","Exterminate! Watch out, so we don't exterminate you!"
tt0068646,"00:57:16,680","00:57:19,180",Pull over. I've got to take a leak.
tt0068646,"00:58:01,060","00:58:04,270",Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.
tt0068646,"00:58:22,450","00:58:25,330","Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!"
tt0068646,"00:58:27,250","00:58:29,380",- Yeah. - Phone call!

tt0068646,"00:58:41,930","00:58:44,350",- Hello. Kay? - How's your father?
tt0068646,"00:58:44,430","00:58:46,430",He's going to make it.
tt0068646,"00:58:46,890","00:58:48,730",I love you.
tt0068646,"00:58:50,150","00:58:51,770",I love you!

tt0068646,"00:58:55,320","00:58:58,240",- Tell me you love me. - I can't talk.
tt0068646,"00:58:58,320","00:59:00,200",Can't you say it?
tt0068646,"00:59:01,410","00:59:03,280",I'll see you tonight.
tt0068646,"00:59:04,080","00:59:07,210",Why don't you tell that nice girl you love her?
tt0068646,"00:59:07,290","00:59:12,090","I love you with all my heart. If I don't see you again soon, I'm going to die!"
tt0068646,"00:59:13,170","00:59:18,050",Come and learn something. You might have to cook for 20 guys some day.
tt0068646,"00:59:18,130","00:59:21,760","You start with a little oil, then fry some garlic."
tt0068646,"00:59:21,890","00:59:27,520","Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, fry it and make sure it doesn't stick."
tt0068646,"00:59:27,600","00:59:31,690","You get it to a boil, you shove in all your sausage and meatballs."
tt0068646,"00:59:33,570","00:59:35,650",Add a little bit of wine.
tt0068646,"00:59:38,900","00:59:43,320",And a little bit of sugar. That's my trick.
tt0068646,"00:59:43,450","00:59:47,700",Cut the crap. I have more important things for you. How's Paulie?
tt0068646,"00:59:47,790","00:59:50,000",You won't see him no more.
tt0068646,"00:59:51,460","00:59:53,960",#NAME?
tt0068646,"00:59:54,040","00:59:57,550",- Send bodyguards with him. - I'm going to the hospital...
tt0068646,"00:59:57,630","01:00:00,970",He'll be all right. Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.
tt0068646,"01:00:01,050","01:00:03,050",#NAME?
tt0068646,"01:00:06,180","01:00:08,470",Send somebody with him anyway.
tt0068646,"01:00:36,540","01:00:39,590",#NAME?
tt0068646,"01:00:41,380","01:00:45,720","No, Kay. There will be detectives there, people from the press."
tt0068646,"01:00:45,800","01:00:47,930",I'll wait in the cab.
tt0068646,"01:00:50,560","01:00:53,190",I don't want you to get involved.
tt0068646,"01:00:55,900","01:00:58,150",When will I see you again?
tt0068646,"01:01:04,490","01:01:08,620","Go back to New Hampshire, and I'll call you at your parents' house."
tt0068646,"01:01:10,370","01:01:15,080","- When will I see you again, Michael? - I don't know."
tt0068646,"01:03:27,300","01:03:31,140",What are you doing here? You're not supposed to be here.
tt0068646,"01:03:31,220","01:03:34,720",I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.
tt0068646,"01:03:34,810","01:03:37,140",What happened to the guards?
tt0068646,"01:03:37,230","01:03:42,650",Your father had too many visitors. They interfered with hospital service.
tt0068646,"01:03:42,730","01:03:46,070",The police made them leave about 10 minutes ago.
tt0068646,"01:03:50,570","01:03:54,530","Get me Long Beach 45620, please."
tt0068646,"01:03:57,080","01:03:59,410",Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.
tt0068646,"01:04:03,460","01:04:08,300","Sonny, I'm at the hospital. I got here late, there's nobody here."
tt0068646,"01:04:08,420","01:04:12,680","No Tessio's men, no detectives, nobody. Papa's all alone."
tt0068646,"01:04:12,760","01:04:15,260",- Don't panic. - I won't panic.
tt0068646,"01:04:16,720","01:04:19,600","I'm sorry, but you will have to leave."
tt0068646,"01:04:22,310","01:04:25,150",We're going to move him to another room.
tt0068646,"01:04:25,230","01:04:28,230",Can you disconnect the tubes?
tt0068646,"01:04:28,320","01:04:31,860",- That's out of the question! - Do you know my father?
tt0068646,"01:04:31,950","01:04:36,240",Men are coming here to kill him. Do you understand?
tt0068646,"01:04:36,330","01:04:38,120","Help me, please."

tt0068646,"01:06:02,160","01:06:05,290","You'd better go, there's going to be trouble."
tt0068646,"01:06:05,370","01:06:10,000","If there is trouble, I'll stay here to help you. For your father."
tt0068646,"01:06:12,000","01:06:16,130","Listen. Wait for me outside, in front of the hospital, all right?"
tt0068646,"01:06:16,220","01:06:18,300",I'll be out in a minute.
tt0068646,"01:06:32,070","01:06:35,820","Just lie here, Pop. I'll take care of you now."
tt0068646,"01:06:37,780","01:06:39,820",I'm with you now.
tt0068646,"01:06:41,450","01:06:42,990",I'm with you.
tt0068646,"01:07:18,450","01:07:20,610",Get rid of these. Come here.
tt0068646,"01:07:21,570","01:07:23,785","Put your hand in your pocket, like you have a gun."
tt0068646,"01:07:23,786","01:07:26,000",You'll be all right.
tt0068646,"01:08:17,340","01:08:19,010",You did good.
tt0068646,"01:09:07,560","01:09:10,770",I thought all you Guinea hoods were locked up!
tt0068646,"01:09:10,890","01:09:15,480",- Why isn't anyone guarding my father? - You little punk!
tt0068646,"01:09:15,560","01:09:19,480",Don't you tell me my business! I pulled them off.
tt0068646,"01:09:19,610","01:09:25,530",- Stay away from this hospital! - Not until my father's room is guarded.
tt0068646,"01:09:26,370","01:09:29,660","- Phil, take him in! - The kid's clean, Captain."
tt0068646,"01:09:29,740","01:09:33,580",- He's a war hero. He's never been... - I said take him in!
tt0068646,"01:09:35,750","01:09:42,010",- What's The Turk paying you? - Take a hold of him. Stand him up.
tt0068646,"01:09:42,090","01:09:43,970",Stand him up straight.
tt0068646,"01:10:06,110","01:10:11,740",I'm the Corleones' attorney. These men are hired to protect Vito Corleone.
tt0068646,"01:10:11,830","01:10:14,250",They're licensed to carry firearms.
tt0068646,"01:10:14,330","01:10:18,750","If you interfere, you'll have to appear before the judge and show 'cause."
tt0068646,"01:10:18,830","01:10:20,840",Let him go.
tt0068646,"01:10:53,240","01:10:57,160",- What's with all the new faces? - We'll need them now.
tt0068646,"01:10:57,250","01:11:00,130","After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad."
tt0068646,"01:11:00,210","01:11:03,380",We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.
tt0068646,"01:11:04,510","01:11:06,510",Jesus Christ.
tt0068646,"01:11:13,180","01:11:15,680",Looks like a fortress around here.
tt0068646,"01:11:17,810","01:11:23,190",Tamaduch! Hey... 100 buttonmen on the street 24 hours a day.
tt0068646,"01:11:23,270","01:11:26,860","That Turk shows one hair on his ass, he's dead."
tt0068646,"01:11:28,900","01:11:30,990","Mike, let me look at you."
tt0068646,"01:11:35,040","01:11:38,080","You're beautiful, beautiful. You're gorgeous."
tt0068646,"01:11:38,210","01:11:43,790",The Turk wants to talk! Imagine the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.

tt0068646,"01:11:46,760","01:11:51,550",What did he say... He wants us to send Michael to hear the proposition.
tt0068646,"01:11:51,640","01:11:55,100",He promises that the deal is too good to refuse.
tt0068646,"01:11:55,180","01:11:58,270",- And Bruno Tattaglia? - That's part of the deal.
tt0068646,"01:11:58,350","01:12:02,650",#NAME?
tt0068646,"01:12:02,730","01:12:05,860","No more! Not this time, Consigliere."
tt0068646,"01:12:05,940","01:12:09,490","No more meetings, discussions, or Sollozzo tricks."
tt0068646,"01:12:09,570","01:12:12,610","I want Sollozzo, or we go to war..."
tt0068646,"01:12:12,700","01:12:15,660",- The other families... - They hand me Sollozzo!
tt0068646,"01:12:15,740","01:12:18,040","This is business, not personal!"
tt0068646,"01:12:18,120","01:12:22,540",#NAME?
tt0068646,"01:12:23,460","01:12:27,210",Then business will have to suffer. Do me a favor.
tt0068646,"01:12:27,300","01:12:31,300",No more advice on how to patch things up. Just help me win.
tt0068646,"01:12:37,600","01:12:41,520","I found out about Captain McCluskey, who broke Mike's jaw."
tt0068646,"01:12:41,600","01:12:45,900","He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money."
tt0068646,"01:12:45,980","01:12:50,030",McCluskey has agreed to be The Turk's bodyguard.
tt0068646,"01:12:50,110","01:12:53,860","So when Sollozzo is being guarded, he's invulnerable."
tt0068646,"01:12:53,950","01:12:57,530",Nobody has ever gunned down a New York police captain.
tt0068646,"01:12:57,660","01:13:03,580",All the families would come after you. The Corleone family would be outcasts!
tt0068646,"01:13:03,670","01:13:07,500",Even the old man's political protection would run for cover.
tt0068646,"01:13:08,800","01:13:12,630",Do me a favor. Take this into consideration.
tt0068646,"01:13:16,470","01:13:18,470","All right, we'll wait."
tt0068646,"01:13:23,890","01:13:26,730",We can't wait. We can't wait.
tt0068646,"01:13:28,190","01:13:32,150","No matter what Sollozzo says, he's going to kill Pop."
tt0068646,"01:13:32,240","01:13:35,950",That's the key for him. We've got to get Sollozzo.
tt0068646,"01:13:36,030","01:13:40,330",#NAME?
tt0068646,"01:13:40,410","01:13:45,000",What about this McCluskey? What do we do with this cop?
tt0068646,"01:13:50,170","01:13:53,050","They want to have a meeting with me, right?"
tt0068646,"01:13:53,920","01:13:58,350","It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo."
tt0068646,"01:14:00,350","01:14:02,350",Let's set the meeting.
tt0068646,"01:14:04,520","01:14:08,230",Get our informers to find out where it's going to be held.
tt0068646,"01:14:10,070","01:14:13,860","We insist it's a public place. A bar, a restaurant."
tt0068646,"01:14:13,940","01:14:17,700","Some place where there are people, so I feel safe."
tt0068646,"01:14:20,450","01:14:23,450","They'll search me when I meet them, right?"
tt0068646,"01:14:23,540","01:14:25,870",So I can't have a weapon on me.
tt0068646,"01:14:29,250","01:14:34,210",But if Clemenza can figure out a way to have a weapon planted there for me
tt0068646,"01:14:39,180","01:14:41,390",then I'll kill them both.
tt0068646,"01:14:53,480","01:14:58,200",Nice college boy. Didn't want to get mixed up in the family business.
tt0068646,"01:14:58,320","01:15:01,950",Now you want to shoot a police captain because he slapped you?
tt0068646,"01:15:02,080","01:15:08,580",This isn't like the army! You have to get close and get their brains on your suit.
tt0068646,"01:15:08,670","01:15:11,710",You're taking this very personal.
tt0068646,"01:15:11,790","01:15:15,210","Tom, this is business and he's taking it personal."
tt0068646,"01:15:15,340","01:15:18,800",- Where does it say you can't kill a cop? - Mikey...
tt0068646,"01:15:18,930","01:15:25,020","I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up in drugs, a dishonest cop."
tt0068646,"01:15:26,060","01:15:30,350",A cop who got mixed up in the rackets and got what was coming.
tt0068646,"01:15:30,480","01:15:35,030","That's a terrific story. We have newspaper people on the payroll, right?"
tt0068646,"01:15:36,490","01:15:40,320",#NAME?
tt0068646,"01:15:43,990","01:15:47,580","It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business."
tt0068646,"01:15:50,790","01:15:52,330",It's as cold as they come.
tt0068646,"01:15:52,420","01:15:55,670","Impossible to trace, so you don't worry about prints."
tt0068646,"01:15:56,090","01:16:00,130",I put a special tape on the trigger and the butt. Try it.
tt0068646,"01:16:12,310","01:16:14,400",Is the trigger too tight?
tt0068646,"01:16:17,730","01:16:18,940",My ears!
tt0068646,"01:16:19,030","01:16:23,660","I left it noisy, so it scares away any pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders."
tt0068646,"01:16:24,830","01:16:27,740",You've shot them both. Now what do you do?
tt0068646,"01:16:30,120","01:16:33,790","- Sit down, finish my dinner. - Don't fool around."
tt0068646,"01:16:33,880","01:16:37,420",Let your hand drop to your side and let the gun slip out.
tt0068646,"01:16:37,500","01:16:41,930","Everybody will still think you've got it. They'll stare at your face,"
tt0068646,"01:16:42,010","01:16:44,890","so walk out fast, but don't run."
tt0068646,"01:16:44,970","01:16:48,390","Don't look anybody in the eye, but don't look away either."
tt0068646,"01:16:48,470","01:16:51,980","They'll be scared stiff, so don't worry about nothing."
tt0068646,"01:16:54,020","01:16:58,280","You'll be all right. You'll take a vacation, nobody knows where,"
tt0068646,"01:16:58,360","01:17:00,440",and we'll catch the hell.
tt0068646,"01:17:01,070","01:17:04,910",#NAME?
tt0068646,"01:17:04,990","01:17:08,040",All the other families will probably line up against us.
tt0068646,"01:17:08,160","01:17:10,935","These things have to happen every five, 10 years."
tt0068646,"01:17:10,936","01:17:13,710",Gets rid of the bad blood.
tt0068646,"01:17:13,830","01:17:18,250",Been 10 years since the last one. You have to stop them at the beginning.
tt0068646,"01:17:18,380","01:17:24,090","Like they should have stopped Hitler in Munich, not letting him get away with it."
tt0068646,"01:17:25,510","01:17:30,020","You know, Mike, we were all proud of you. Being a hero and all."
tt0068646,"01:17:30,100","01:17:31,810",Your father too.
tt0068646,"01:18:09,890","01:18:13,310",Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.
tt0068646,"01:18:14,270","01:18:18,520",Even Sollozzo's people don't know where the meeting will be held.
tt0068646,"01:18:18,610","01:18:20,940",How much time do we have?
tt0068646,"01:18:21,820","01:18:26,610",They're going to pick you up outside Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.
tt0068646,"01:18:27,610","01:18:32,490",#NAME?
tt0068646,"01:18:33,870","01:18:38,420",- What about the negotiator? - He's playing pinochle with my men.
tt0068646,"01:18:38,540","01:18:43,630",- He's happy. They're letting him win. - Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.
tt0068646,"01:18:43,710","01:18:47,090",The negotiator plays cards until Mike is back safe.
tt0068646,"01:18:47,180","01:18:51,220",- He could blast whoever is in the car. - They'll expect that.
tt0068646,"01:18:51,300","01:18:54,640","Sollozzo might not even be in the car, Sonny!"
tt0068646,"01:18:54,730","01:18:56,230",I'll get it.
tt0068646,"01:19:21,500","01:19:23,670",Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.
tt0068646,"01:19:23,750","01:19:27,090",- Is it reliable? - My man in McCluskey's precinct.
tt0068646,"01:19:27,220","01:19:32,930",A police captain is on call 24 hours a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10.
tt0068646,"01:19:33,010","01:19:37,890","- Anybody know this joint? - Sure, I do. It's perfect for us."
tt0068646,"01:19:37,980","01:19:42,940","A small family place, good food. Everyone minds his business. Perfect."
tt0068646,"01:19:43,690","01:19:48,860","They've got an old-fashioned toilet. You know, the box and the chain thing."
tt0068646,"01:19:50,860","01:19:53,950",We might be able to tape the gun behind it.
tt0068646,"01:19:54,030","01:19:58,160","All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,"
tt0068646,"01:19:58,250","01:20:02,130","you eat, talk for a while, you relax. Make them relax."
tt0068646,"01:20:02,210","01:20:07,550","Then you go to take a leak. No, better still, you ask permission to go."
tt0068646,"01:20:07,630","01:20:12,090",Then you come back blasting. Two shots in the head apiece.
tt0068646,"01:20:13,850","01:20:16,350",I want somebody very good to plant that gun.
tt0068646,"01:20:16,430","01:20:19,940",I don't want him coming out with just his dick.
tt0068646,"01:20:20,020","01:20:25,570",#NAME?
tt0068646,"01:20:25,650","01:20:27,320",Let's move.
tt0068646,"01:20:32,820","01:20:35,990",Did he tell you to drop the gun right away?
tt0068646,"01:20:36,080","01:20:37,950","Yeah, a million times."
tt0068646,"01:20:42,710","01:20:46,920",Don't forget. Two shots apiece in the head as soon as you come out.
tt0068646,"01:20:53,510","01:20:57,100",How long do you think it will be before I can come back?
tt0068646,"01:20:57,930","01:21:00,020",At least a year.
tt0068646,"01:21:00,140","01:21:04,940","I'll square it with Mom, that you're not seeing her before you leave and..."
tt0068646,"01:21:06,480","01:21:10,320",I'll get a message to that girlfriend when the time is right.
tt0068646,"01:21:16,160","01:21:17,660",Take care.
tt0068646,"01:21:20,450","01:21:22,210","Take care, Mike."
tt0068646,"01:21:55,030","01:21:58,830",I'm glad you came. I hope we can straighten everything out.
tt0068646,"01:22:00,040","01:22:05,120",It's not the way I wanted things to go. It should never have happened.
tt0068646,"01:22:05,250","01:22:09,540",I want to straighten everything out. I don't want my father bothered again.
tt0068646,"01:22:09,630","01:22:12,880","I swear on my children that he won't be, Mike."
tt0068646,"01:22:13,880","01:22:17,180",But you have to keep an open mind when we talk.
tt0068646,"01:22:17,260","01:22:21,680",I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny. You can't talk business with him.
tt0068646,"01:22:23,560","01:22:25,230",He's a good kid.
tt0068646,"01:22:29,310","01:22:32,690","I'm sorry about the other night, Mike."
tt0068646,"01:22:32,780","01:22:36,860","I've got to frisk you, so turn around. On your knees, facing me."
tt0068646,"01:22:41,990","01:22:46,670",I guess I'm getting too old for my job. Too grouchy.
tt0068646,"01:22:48,080","01:22:51,920",Can't stand the aggravation. You know how it is.
tt0068646,"01:22:54,210","01:22:55,630",He's clean.
tt0068646,"01:23:22,240","01:23:24,540",Going to Jersey?
tt0068646,"01:23:27,040","01:23:28,580",Maybe.
tt0068646,"01:23:53,860","01:23:55,650","Nice work, Lou."
tt0068646,"01:24:32,810","01:24:38,360",- How's the food in this restaurant? - Try the veal. It's the best in the city.
tt0068646,"01:24:38,440","01:24:40,110",I'll have it.
tt0068646,"01:25:15,690","01:25:18,860",- I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey. - Go ahead.
tt0068646,"01:26:38,480","01:26:40,150",What I want...
tt0068646,"01:26:41,110","01:26:43,280",What's most important to me
tt0068646,"01:26:46,030","01:26:50,240",is that I have a guarantee. No more attempts on my father's life.
tt0068646,"01:26:50,330","01:26:55,080",What guarantees can I give you? I'm the hunted one!
tt0068646,"01:26:55,160","01:26:58,710","I missed my chance. You think too much of me, kid."
tt0068646,"01:26:58,790","01:27:00,630",I'm not that clever.
tt0068646,"01:27:02,130","01:27:04,380",All I want is a truce.
tt0068646,"01:27:10,930","01:27:14,770",I have to go to the bathroom. Is it all right?
tt0068646,"01:27:16,140","01:27:18,650","When you got to go, you got to go."
tt0068646,"01:27:24,150","01:27:26,070",He's clean.
tt0068646,"01:27:26,150","01:27:28,240",Don't take too long.
tt0068646,"01:27:31,370","01:27:33,160",I've frisked a thousand punks.
tt0068646,"01:32:23,780","01:32:25,790","Okay, you take over."
tt0068646,"01:32:43,050","01:32:44,890","I love you, Grandpa."
tt0068646,"01:32:47,810","01:32:50,520","I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet."
tt0068646,"01:32:51,850","01:32:54,940",#NAME?
tt0068646,"01:32:55,060","01:33:01,320",""" I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."""
tt0068646,"01:33:04,320","01:33:06,620",Go with your mother.
tt0068646,"01:33:06,700","01:33:08,830",Take them downstairs.
tt0068646,"01:33:14,960","01:33:17,000","Go on, Carlo, you too."
tt0068646,"01:33:18,710","01:33:20,420",Go on.
tt0068646,"01:33:41,030","01:33:45,030","- What's the matter with you, Carlo? - Shut up and set the table."
tt0068646,"01:34:00,590","01:34:06,640","Since McCluskey's killing, the police have cracked down on our operations."
tt0068646,"01:34:08,390","01:34:13,270",And also the other families. There's been a lot of bad blood.
tt0068646,"01:34:13,350","01:34:16,850","They hit us, so we hit them back."
tt0068646,"01:34:17,690","01:34:22,230",Through our newspaper contacts we've been able to put out material
tt0068646,"01:34:22,320","01:34:26,610",about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo in the drug rackets.
tt0068646,"01:34:26,700","01:34:28,820",So things are loosening up.
tt0068646,"01:34:30,080","01:34:34,830","And I'm sending Fredo to Las Vegas,"
tt0068646,"01:34:34,910","01:34:37,460",under the protection of Don Francesco of L.A.
tt0068646,"01:34:37,580","01:34:42,090",- I want him to rest. - I'm going to learn the casino business.
tt0068646,"01:34:50,430","01:34:52,220",Where's Michael?
tt0068646,"01:35:04,530","01:35:07,660",It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.
tt0068646,"01:35:09,450","01:35:13,290",But he's safe. We're starting to work to bring him back.
tt0068646,"01:35:34,680","01:35:37,060",I want you to find out where that old pimp Tattaglia is hiding.
tt0068646,"01:35:37,140","01:35:39,100",I want him now.
tt0068646,"01:35:39,190","01:35:42,730","Sonny, things are starting to loosen up."
tt0068646,"01:35:42,820","01:35:47,530","If you go after Tattaglia, all hell will break loose. Pop can negotiate."
tt0068646,"01:35:47,610","01:35:53,620",- He must get better first. I'll decide... - War is costly. We can't do business.
tt0068646,"01:35:53,700","01:35:57,540",- Neither can they. Don't worry about it! - We can't afford a stalemate.
tt0068646,"01:35:57,660","01:36:02,590",- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard! - You're getting a great reputation!
tt0068646,"01:36:02,710","01:36:08,760","Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime consigliere, I wouldn't be in this shape!"
tt0068646,"01:36:08,840","01:36:11,140",Pop had Genco. Look what I got.
tt0068646,"01:36:14,720","01:36:17,020",I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
tt0068646,"01:36:18,180","01:36:21,150",Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.
tt0068646,"01:36:22,060","01:36:26,440",Niggers are having a good time with our policy banks in Harlem.
tt0068646,"01:36:26,530","01:36:30,700","Driving new Cadillacs, paying 50% on a bet."
tt0068646,"01:36:30,780","01:36:34,120",That's because they've started making big money.
tt0068646,"01:36:34,200","01:36:37,500",Papa never talked business at the table.
tt0068646,"01:36:37,580","01:36:41,460","- Shut up, Connie... - Don't you ever tell her to shut up."
tt0068646,"01:36:42,210","01:36:43,290",Don't interfere.
tt0068646,"01:36:45,590","01:36:49,510",I'd like to talk to you after dinner. I could do more for the family...
tt0068646,"01:36:49,590","01:36:52,380",We don't discuss business at the table.
tt0068646,"01:37:39,600","01:37:42,230","I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino."
tt0068646,"01:37:47,770","01:37:49,780",Why are you so far from the house?
tt0068646,"01:37:50,440","01:37:53,110",You know I'm responsible to your father for your life.
tt0068646,"01:37:53,200","01:37:54,490",The bodyguards are here.
tt0068646,"01:37:55,410","01:37:56,740",It's still dangerous...
tt0068646,"01:37:57,870","01:37:59,620",We've heard from Santino in New York...
tt0068646,"01:38:01,040","01:38:03,290",Your enemies know you're here.
tt0068646,"01:38:05,290","01:38:07,040",Did Santino say when I can go back?
tt0068646,"01:38:07,710","01:38:09,000",Not yet.
tt0068646,"01:38:09,670","01:38:11,510",It's out of the question.
tt0068646,"01:38:14,970","01:38:16,390",Where are you going now?
tt0068646,"01:38:18,050","01:38:19,100",To Corleone.
tt0068646,"01:38:19,720","01:38:20,970",Take my car.
tt0068646,"01:38:24,310","01:38:25,350",I want to walk.
tt0068646,"01:38:27,980","01:38:29,150",Be careful.
tt0068646,"01:39:03,680","01:39:05,060",Where have all the men gone?
tt0068646,"01:39:06,100","01:39:08,310",They're all dead from vendettas.
tt0068646,"01:39:09,940","01:39:12,360",There are the names of the dead.
tt0068646,"01:39:28,750","01:39:32,880","Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!"
tt0068646,"01:39:32,960","01:39:37,260","Hey, hey, take me to the America, G. I.! Clark Gable!"
tt0068646,"01:39:37,380","01:39:42,640","America! Take me to the America, G. I.! Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!"
tt0068646,"01:40:00,570","01:40:02,620",Mamma Mia what a beauty.
tt0068646,"01:40:10,790","01:40:13,880",I think you got hit by the thunderbolt.
tt0068646,"01:40:20,090","01:40:24,100",In Sicily women are more dangerous than shotguns.
tt0068646,"01:40:46,790","01:40:48,950",Did you have a good hunt?
tt0068646,"01:40:49,910","01:40:52,290",You know all the girls around here?
tt0068646,"01:40:52,790","01:40:54,290",We saw some real beauties.
tt0068646,"01:40:55,130","01:40:58,630",One of them struck our friend like a thunderbolt.
tt0068646,"01:41:01,840","01:41:04,600",She would tempt the devil himself.
tt0068646,"01:41:12,230","01:41:14,400",Really put together.
tt0068646,"01:41:14,480","01:41:15,520","Right, Calo?"
tt0068646,"01:41:19,280","01:41:21,280","Such hair, such mouth!"
tt0068646,"01:41:23,660","01:41:26,830",The girls around here are beautiful... but virtuous.
tt0068646,"01:41:27,370","01:41:29,750",This one had a purple dress...
tt0068646,"01:41:30,120","01:41:32,250",And a purple ribbon in her hair.
tt0068646,"01:41:33,120","01:41:36,290",A type more Greek than Italian.
tt0068646,"01:41:38,710","01:41:40,550",Do you know her?
tt0068646,"01:41:44,970","01:41:47,760",There's no girl like that in this town.
tt0068646,"01:41:50,470","01:41:51,680","My God, I understand!"
tt0068646,"01:41:55,810","01:41:56,810",What's wrong?
tt0068646,"01:41:59,020","01:42:00,400",Let's go.
tt0068646,"01:42:02,360","01:42:03,610",It's his daughter.
tt0068646,"01:42:04,070","01:42:05,570",Tell him to come here.
tt0068646,"01:42:08,990","01:42:10,330",Call him.
tt0068646,"01:42:30,390","01:42:32,720","Fabrizio, you translate."
tt0068646,"01:42:36,850","01:42:38,730",I apologize if I offended you.
tt0068646,"01:42:39,730","01:42:43,150",I'm a stranger in this country.
tt0068646,"01:42:43,240","01:42:46,320",I meant no disrespect to you or your daughter.
tt0068646,"01:42:51,790","01:42:54,660","I'm an American, hiding in Sicily."
tt0068646,"01:42:56,080","01:42:58,420",My name is Michael Corleone.
tt0068646,"01:43:00,460","01:43:04,590",There are people who'd pay a lot of money for that information.
tt0068646,"01:43:06,760","01:43:09,800",But then your daughter would lose a father
tt0068646,"01:43:11,390","01:43:13,770",instead of gaining a husband.
tt0068646,"01:43:21,940","01:43:24,150",I want to meet your daughter.
tt0068646,"01:43:24,820","01:43:29,410","With your permission, and under the supervision of your family."
tt0068646,"01:43:30,070","01:43:31,740",With all respect.
tt0068646,"01:43:37,790","01:43:41,790",Come to my house Sunday morning. My name is Vitelli.
tt0068646,"01:43:47,300","01:43:48,800",What's her name?
tt0068646,"01:46:44,140","01:46:46,310",I'll knock you dizzy.
tt0068646,"01:46:52,070","01:46:54,150",Save it for the library.
tt0068646,"01:46:57,820","01:47:00,490",We've got to pick up my sister.
tt0068646,"01:47:18,550","01:47:20,260",What's the matter?
tt0068646,"01:47:22,720","01:47:24,520",What's the matter?
tt0068646,"01:47:26,310","01:47:28,230",- It was my fault! - Where is he?
tt0068646,"01:47:28,310","01:47:31,480",It was my fault. I hit him.
tt0068646,"01:47:31,570","01:47:35,360","I started a fight with him. I hit him, so he hit me..."
tt0068646,"01:47:40,570","01:47:43,870",I'm just going to get a doctor to take a look at you.
tt0068646,"01:47:43,950","01:47:46,460","Sonny, please don't do anything."
tt0068646,"01:47:48,420","01:47:50,500",What's the matter with you? What am I going to do?
tt0068646,"01:47:50,580","01:47:53,460",Make that baby an orphan before he's born?
tt0068646,"01:47:58,010","01:48:01,220",You spic slobs still betting Yankees?
tt0068646,"01:48:01,300","01:48:03,970",Tell them to stop taking in action.
tt0068646,"01:48:04,810","01:48:06,520",We lost enough money last week.
tt0068646,"01:48:13,650","01:48:15,690","Come here, come here!"
tt0068646,"01:49:12,620","01:49:15,960","If you touch my sister again, I'll kill you."
tt0068646,"01:53:09,190","01:53:13,450","Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay. You should call."
tt0068646,"01:53:13,530","01:53:17,870","Yes, I have. I've tried writing and calling."
tt0068646,"01:53:17,950","01:53:21,790",#NAME?
tt0068646,"01:53:21,870","01:53:24,420",All we know is that he's all right.
tt0068646,"01:53:26,960","01:53:30,590",#NAME?
tt0068646,"01:53:31,720","01:53:35,850","Tom, will you give this letter to Michael. Please?"
tt0068646,"01:53:37,390","01:53:42,560","If I accepted that, a court could prove I have knowledge of his whereabouts."
tt0068646,"01:53:43,560","01:53:45,440",He'll get in touch with you.
tt0068646,"01:53:45,560","01:53:49,230","I let my cab go, so can I call another one, please?"
tt0068646,"01:53:49,320","01:53:51,190",Come on. Sorry.
tt0068646,"01:54:08,420","01:54:13,090",#NAME?
tt0068646,"01:54:13,880","01:54:16,340",#NAME?
tt0068646,"01:54:16,430","01:54:19,810",Tell him that I can't make it tonight until later.
tt0068646,"01:54:25,560","01:54:26,810",Bitch!
tt0068646,"01:54:28,820","01:54:31,610",- Dinner's on the table. - I'm not hungry.
tt0068646,"01:54:31,690","01:54:35,030",- The food is getting cold. - I'll eat out later.
tt0068646,"01:54:35,110","01:54:38,490",- You just told me to make you dinner! - Vafangool!
tt0068646,"01:54:38,700","01:54:40,830",I'll vafangool you!
tt0068646,"01:54:45,670","01:54:48,460","She has a filthy mouth, this Guinea brat."
tt0068646,"01:54:52,800","01:54:57,140","That's it, break it all, you spoiled Guinea brat. Break it all!"
tt0068646,"01:55:06,350","01:55:09,480",Why don't you bring your whore home for dinner?
tt0068646,"01:55:10,480","01:55:12,150",Maybe I will.
tt0068646,"01:55:18,910","01:55:22,080",- Clean it up! - Like hell I will!
tt0068646,"01:55:22,160","01:55:26,080","You skinny, spoiled brat. Clean it up! Clean it up!"
tt0068646,"01:55:26,160","01:55:30,670","Clean it up! I said, clean it up! Clean it up!"
tt0068646,"01:55:30,750","01:55:35,590","Clean it up. Clean that up, you..."
tt0068646,"01:55:38,840","01:55:40,550",Clean it!
tt0068646,"01:55:40,640","01:55:44,890","Clean it up! Yeah, kill me. Be a murderer, like your father!"
tt0068646,"01:55:44,970","01:55:48,440",- All you Corleones are murderers! - I hate you!
tt0068646,"01:55:48,520","01:55:50,230","Come on, kill me!"
tt0068646,"01:55:51,770","01:55:53,440",Get out of here!
tt0068646,"01:55:53,520","01:55:56,950",- I hate you! - Now I'll kill you.
tt0068646,"01:55:57,030","01:55:59,700",You Guinea brat. Get out of here!
tt0068646,"01:56:10,170","01:56:13,130","Connie, what's the matter? I can't hear you."
tt0068646,"01:56:14,250","01:56:17,300","Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying."
tt0068646,"01:56:17,380","01:56:20,300","Santino, I can't understand. I don't know."
tt0068646,"01:56:21,590","01:56:23,390","Yeah, Connie."
tt0068646,"01:56:28,060","01:56:30,020",You wait there.
tt0068646,"01:56:32,650","01:56:35,190","No, you just wait there."
tt0068646,"01:56:37,360","01:56:39,610",Son-of-a-bitch.
tt0068646,"01:56:39,700","01:56:42,910",- Son-of-a-bitch! - What's the matter?
tt0068646,"01:56:47,080","01:56:50,160",Open the goddamn gate! Get off your ass.
tt0068646,"01:56:58,170","01:56:59,420",Sonny!
tt0068646,"01:57:05,890","01:57:07,890",- Sonny. - Get out of here!
tt0068646,"01:57:08,980","01:57:10,850","Go after him, go on!"
tt0068646,"01:57:40,590","01:57:42,630",Son-of-a-bitch. Come on!
tt0068646,"01:59:31,330","01:59:33,160",Give me a drop.
tt0068646,"01:59:41,590","01:59:43,880",My wife is crying upstairs.
tt0068646,"01:59:46,260","01:59:48,760",I hear cars coming to the house.
tt0068646,"01:59:53,430","01:59:56,350","Consigliere of mine,"
tt0068646,"01:59:56,430","01:59:59,940",tell your Don what everyone seems to know.
tt0068646,"02:00:00,020","02:00:02,400",I didn't tell Mama anything.
tt0068646,"02:00:03,360","02:00:06,610",I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.
tt0068646,"02:00:10,110","02:00:12,330",But you needed a drink first.
tt0068646,"02:00:14,660","02:00:15,910",Yeah.
tt0068646,"02:00:19,210","02:00:21,710","Well, now you've had your drink."
tt0068646,"02:00:27,260","02:00:31,140",They shot Sonny on the causeway. He's dead.
tt0068646,"02:00:48,190","02:00:50,740",I want no inquiries made.
tt0068646,"02:00:55,200","02:00:57,750",I want no acts of vengeance.
tt0068646,"02:00:59,460","02:01:02,290",I want you to arrange a meeting
tt0068646,"02:01:03,290","02:01:05,920",with the heads of the five families.
tt0068646,"02:01:07,840","02:01:09,920",This war stops now.
tt0068646,"02:01:31,860","02:01:34,410",Call Bonasera.
tt0068646,"02:01:34,490","02:01:36,660",I need him now.
tt0068646,"02:01:49,050","02:01:54,220","This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for Vito Corleone, at his request."
tt0068646,"02:01:54,300","02:01:56,680",You owe your Don a service.
tt0068646,"02:01:56,760","02:02:00,310",He has no doubt that you will repay it.
tt0068646,"02:02:00,390","02:02:02,560",He will be at your funeral parlor in one hour.
tt0068646,"02:02:02,561","02:02:04,730",Be there to greet him.
tt0068646,"02:02:25,920","02:02:30,710","Well, my friend, are you ready to do me this service?"
tt0068646,"02:02:30,800","02:02:33,880",Yes. What do you want me to do?
tt0068646,"02:02:42,270","02:02:46,730",I want you to use all your powers and all your skills.
tt0068646,"02:02:50,900","02:02:53,820",I don't want his mother to see him this way.
tt0068646,"02:03:09,840","02:03:12,960",Look how they massacred my boy.
tt0068646,"02:03:41,990","02:03:45,250",It's safer to teach you English!
tt0068646,"02:03:46,000","02:03:47,420",I know English...
tt0068646,"02:03:47,500","02:03:52,290","Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday."
tt0068646,"02:03:59,510","02:04:01,300","Greetings, Don Tommasino."
tt0068646,"02:04:02,010","02:04:04,010",How are things in Palermo?
tt0068646,"02:04:10,020","02:04:14,070","Michael is teaching me to drive... watch, I'll show you."
tt0068646,"02:04:16,860","02:04:18,700",How are things in Palermo?
tt0068646,"02:04:19,070","02:04:22,200",Young people don't respect anything anymore...
tt0068646,"02:04:23,280","02:04:26,660",times are changing for the worse.
tt0068646,"02:04:28,910","02:04:32,330",This place has become too dangerous for you.
tt0068646,"02:04:35,050","02:04:40,220",I want you to move to a villa near Siracusa... right now.
tt0068646,"02:04:46,220","02:04:47,390",What's wrong?
tt0068646,"02:04:48,520","02:04:50,730",Bad news from America.
tt0068646,"02:04:53,190","02:04:56,900","Your brother, Santino, they killed him."
tt0068646,"02:05:03,490","02:05:05,330",Let's go... you promised.
tt0068646,"02:05:24,140","02:05:25,140",Fabrizio!
tt0068646,"02:05:25,220","02:05:26,640",Get the car.
tt0068646,"02:05:28,020","02:05:32,190","Are you driving yourself, Boss? Is your wife coming with you?"
tt0068646,"02:05:32,270","02:05:35,860","No, take her to her father's house until things are safe."
tt0068646,"02:05:35,940","02:05:37,860","Okay, anything you say."
tt0068646,"02:05:43,780","02:05:45,530","Calo, where is Apollonia?"
tt0068646,"02:05:46,280","02:05:49,790",She's going to surprise you. She wants to drive.
tt0068646,"02:05:52,080","02:05:54,120",She'll make a good American wife.
tt0068646,"02:05:55,580","02:05:58,130","Wait, I'll get the baggage."
tt0068646,"02:06:08,390","02:06:10,560",Fabrizio!
tt0068646,"02:06:10,640","02:06:12,310",Where are you going?
tt0068646,"02:06:14,020","02:06:16,440",Wait there! I'll drive to you.
tt0068646,"02:06:22,570","02:06:23,990","No, Apollonia!"
tt0068646,"02:06:47,050","02:06:52,890","Don Barzini, I want to thank you for helping me organize this meeting,"
tt0068646,"02:06:53,020","02:06:57,860",and the other heads of the five families from New York and New Jersey.
tt0068646,"02:06:59,610","02:07:02,740","Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,"
tt0068646,"02:07:02,820","02:07:06,160",and from Brooklyn
tt0068646,"02:07:07,780","02:07:09,870",Philip Tattaglia.
tt0068646,"02:07:11,660","02:07:14,370",And from Staten Island
tt0068646,"02:07:14,460","02:07:17,960",we have with us Victor Strachi.
tt0068646,"02:07:18,040","02:07:23,670",And the other associates that came as far as from California and Kansas City
tt0068646,"02:07:23,760","02:07:27,510",and all the other territories of the country. Thank you.
tt0068646,"02:07:34,350","02:07:37,810",How did things ever get so far?
tt0068646,"02:07:37,900","02:07:39,520",I don't know.
tt0068646,"02:07:41,570","02:07:45,070","It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary."
tt0068646,"02:07:48,200","02:07:51,620","Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son."
tt0068646,"02:07:54,080","02:07:57,500","We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,"
tt0068646,"02:07:57,580","02:08:01,590",then I'm willing to let things go on as before.
tt0068646,"02:08:03,050","02:08:06,670",We're grateful to Don Corleone for calling this meeting.
tt0068646,"02:08:06,760","02:08:12,140",We all know him as a man of his word. A modest man who listens to reason.
tt0068646,"02:08:12,220","02:08:16,310","Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest."
tt0068646,"02:08:16,390","02:08:20,600",He had all the judges and politicians in his pocket.
tt0068646,"02:08:20,690","02:08:23,570",He refused to share them.
tt0068646,"02:08:23,650","02:08:27,440",When did I ever refuse an accommodation?
tt0068646,"02:08:27,530","02:08:29,910",All of you know me.
tt0068646,"02:08:30,820","02:08:35,990","When did I ever refuse, except one time? And why?"
tt0068646,"02:08:37,660","02:08:43,500",Because I believe this drug business will destroy us in the years to come.
tt0068646,"02:08:43,590","02:08:47,840","It's not like gambling or liquor or even women,"
tt0068646,"02:08:47,920","02:08:53,890","which is something that most people want, but is forbidden by the Church."
tt0068646,"02:08:54,010","02:08:58,730",Even the police that have helped us in the past with gambling and other things
tt0068646,"02:08:58,810","02:09:03,020",are going to refuse to help us when it comes to narcotics.
tt0068646,"02:09:03,110","02:09:08,240",I believed that then and I believe that now.
tt0068646,"02:09:08,320","02:09:10,530",Times have changed.
tt0068646,"02:09:10,650","02:09:15,370","It's not like the old days, when we could do anything we wanted."
tt0068646,"02:09:15,450","02:09:18,330",A refusal is not the act of a friend.
tt0068646,"02:09:18,410","02:09:23,830","If Don Corleone had all the judges and politicians, then he must share them"
tt0068646,"02:09:23,920","02:09:28,510",or let others use them. He must let us draw the water from the well.
tt0068646,"02:09:29,590","02:09:33,180",Certainly he can present a bill for such services.
tt0068646,"02:09:33,260","02:09:35,850","After all, we're not communists."
tt0068646,"02:09:38,970","02:09:42,060",I also don't believe in drugs.
tt0068646,"02:09:42,190","02:09:47,020","For years I paid my people extra, so they wouldn't do that kind of business."
tt0068646,"02:09:47,110","02:09:50,240","Somebody says to them "" I have powders."""
tt0068646,"02:09:50,320","02:09:53,570",""" If you put up 3-4,000 dollar investment,"
tt0068646,"02:09:53,860","02:09:56,660","we can make 50,000 distributing."""
tt0068646,"02:09:57,870","02:10:03,790","They can't resist. I want to control it as a business, keep it respectable."
tt0068646,"02:10:03,870","02:10:08,670","I don't want it near schools, I don't want it sold to children."
tt0068646,"02:10:08,750","02:10:10,550",Thats an infàmia.
tt0068646,"02:10:11,880","02:10:15,800",In my city we would keep the traffic to the colored.
tt0068646,"02:10:15,890","02:10:19,100","They're animals, so let them lose their souls."
tt0068646,"02:10:25,730","02:10:29,320",I hoped that we could come here and reason together.
tt0068646,"02:10:30,730","02:10:37,370",And I'm willing to do whatever is necessary to find a peaceful solution.
tt0068646,"02:10:37,910","02:10:42,500","We are agreed. The traffic in drugs will be permitted, but controlled."
tt0068646,"02:10:42,580","02:10:46,880","Don Corleone will give us protection in the east, and there will be peace."
tt0068646,"02:10:46,960","02:10:50,710",I must have strict assurance from Corleone.
tt0068646,"02:10:50,800","02:10:54,090","As time goes by and his position becomes stronger,"
tt0068646,"02:10:54,170","02:10:56,840",will he attempt any individual vendetta?
tt0068646,"02:10:56,930","02:11:02,060",We are all reasonable men. We don't have to give assurances.
tt0068646,"02:11:02,140","02:11:05,020",You talk about vengeance.
tt0068646,"02:11:05,100","02:11:08,360",Will vengeance bring your son back to you?
tt0068646,"02:11:08,440","02:11:10,980",Or my boy to me?
tt0068646,"02:11:11,070","02:11:13,860",I forgo the vengeance of my son.
tt0068646,"02:11:16,660","02:11:18,950",But I have selfish reasons.
tt0068646,"02:11:21,240","02:11:24,830",My youngest son was forced to leave this country
tt0068646,"02:11:26,710","02:11:29,250",because of this Sollozzo business.
tt0068646,"02:11:30,790","02:11:34,720",And I have to make arrangements to bring him back here safely.
tt0068646,"02:11:34,800","02:11:37,470",Cleared of all these false charges.
tt0068646,"02:11:38,890","02:11:42,010",But I'm a superstitious man.
tt0068646,"02:11:42,140","02:11:47,440","If an unlucky accident should befall him, if he should be shot by a police officer,"
tt0068646,"02:11:48,810","02:11:52,400","or if he should hang himself in his jail cell,"
tt0068646,"02:11:52,480","02:11:55,360","or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,"
tt0068646,"02:11:56,650","02:12:00,240",then I'm going to blame some of the people in this room.
tt0068646,"02:12:01,910","02:12:04,240",And that I do not forgive.
tt0068646,"02:12:06,710","02:12:09,080","But, that aside"
tt0068646,"02:12:12,170","02:12:14,500",let me say that I swear
tt0068646,"02:12:16,130","02:12:19,260","on the souls of my grandchildren,"
tt0068646,"02:12:19,340","02:12:23,720",that I will not be the one to break the peace we've made here today.
tt0068646,"02:12:49,210","02:12:54,670",Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's drug middlemen have clean records?
tt0068646,"02:12:54,750","02:12:56,880",Mention it. Don't insist.
tt0068646,"02:12:58,880","02:13:03,800",#NAME?
tt0068646,"02:13:05,430","02:13:07,390",Tattaglia's a pimp.
tt0068646,"02:13:08,480","02:13:11,600",He could never have outfought Santino.
tt0068646,"02:13:13,980","02:13:19,570",But I didn't know until this day that it was Barzini all along.
tt0068646,"02:13:35,040","02:13:37,130","Come on, Nancy."
tt0068646,"02:13:38,340","02:13:40,920","Keep together, everyone. Brian."
tt0068646,"02:13:42,260","02:13:43,930","Okay, all right."
tt0068646,"02:13:57,020","02:13:59,230",How long have you been back?
tt0068646,"02:14:00,030","02:14:01,860",I've been back a year.
tt0068646,"02:14:03,280","02:14:05,410","Longer than that, I think."
tt0068646,"02:14:08,240","02:14:10,410","It's good to see you, Kay."
tt0068646,"02:14:21,470","02:14:24,010","I'm working for my father now, Kay."
tt0068646,"02:14:26,510","02:14:29,510",He's been sick. Very sick.
tt0068646,"02:14:31,060","02:14:33,020",But you're not like him.
tt0068646,"02:14:33,100","02:14:36,900",You told me you weren't going to become like your father.
tt0068646,"02:14:38,820","02:14:43,110",My father is no different than any other powerful man.
tt0068646,"02:14:43,200","02:14:46,660",Any man who's responsible for other people.
tt0068646,"02:14:47,870","02:14:50,290",Like a senator or president.
tt0068646,"02:14:50,370","02:14:52,830",#NAME?
tt0068646,"02:14:52,910","02:14:55,750",They don't have men killed.
tt0068646,"02:14:59,170","02:15:01,170","Who's being naive, Kay?"
tt0068646,"02:15:02,420","02:15:06,680",My father's way of doing things is over. Even he knows that.
tt0068646,"02:15:08,220","02:15:12,600",In five years the Corleone family is going to be completely legitimate.
tt0068646,"02:15:14,430","02:15:18,400",Trust me. That's all I can tell you about my business. Kay...
tt0068646,"02:15:19,860","02:15:22,980","Michael, why did you come here? Why?"
tt0068646,"02:15:24,280","02:15:26,700",What do you want with me after all this time?
tt0068646,"02:15:26,701","02:15:29,120",I've been calling and writing.
tt0068646,"02:15:29,200","02:15:32,700",I came because I need you. I care for you.
tt0068646,"02:15:32,790","02:15:36,620",#NAME?
tt0068646,"02:15:38,330","02:15:40,920","- It's too late. - Please, Kay..."
tt0068646,"02:15:42,670","02:15:46,550",I'll do anything you ask to make up for what's happened to us.
tt0068646,"02:15:48,220","02:15:52,470","Because that's important, Kay. Because what's important is that"
tt0068646,"02:15:54,020","02:15:57,270",we have each other. That we have a life together.
tt0068646,"02:15:58,850","02:16:01,570",That we have children. Our children.
tt0068646,"02:16:03,070","02:16:05,240","Kay, I need you."
tt0068646,"02:16:07,200","02:16:08,780",And I love you.
tt0068646,"02:16:30,930","02:16:34,680",Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it!
tt0068646,"02:16:34,810","02:16:38,440",- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat! - Be patient.
tt0068646,"02:16:38,520","02:16:41,650",I'm not asking for help. Just take off the handcuffs.
tt0068646,"02:16:41,730","02:16:44,860",#NAME?
tt0068646,"02:16:44,940","02:16:48,400",#NAME?
tt0068646,"02:16:48,490","02:16:52,370","- Barzini would get an excuse to fight. - Mike, you're wrong."
tt0068646,"02:16:53,870","02:16:56,040",Don Corleone...
tt0068646,"02:16:56,120","02:17:00,250",You once said that one day Tessio and me could form our own family.
tt0068646,"02:17:00,330","02:17:04,380",Till today I would never think of it. I must ask your permission.
tt0068646,"02:17:05,380","02:17:08,050",Michael is now head of the family.
tt0068646,"02:17:08,130","02:17:12,430","If he gives his permission, then you have my blessing."
tt0068646,"02:17:12,510","02:17:14,890",After we make the move to Nevada
tt0068646,"02:17:14,970","02:17:19,390",you can leave the Corleone family and go on your own.
tt0068646,"02:17:19,480","02:17:23,810",#NAME?
tt0068646,"02:17:23,900","02:17:27,150","Forgive me, but with you gone,"
tt0068646,"02:17:27,230","02:17:30,070",me and Pete will come under Barzini's thumb.
tt0068646,"02:17:30,150","02:17:35,830",I hate that Barzini. In six months' time there will be nothing left to build on.

tt0068646,"02:17:38,910","02:17:41,830",#NAME?
tt0068646,"02:17:41,920","02:17:45,170",Then be a friend to Michael. Do as he says.
tt0068646,"02:17:50,090","02:17:55,430",Things are negotiated that'll solve your problems and answer your questions.
tt0068646,"02:17:55,510","02:17:57,850",That's all I can tell you now.
tt0068646,"02:17:58,680","02:18:01,270","Carlo, you grew up in Nevada."
tt0068646,"02:18:01,350","02:18:04,730","When we make our move there, you'll be my right-hand man."
tt0068646,"02:18:04,810","02:18:09,610",Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere. He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.
tt0068646,"02:18:09,690","02:18:12,240","That's no reflection on Tom, just how I want it."
tt0068646,"02:18:12,320","02:18:17,030","If I ever need help, who's a better consigliere than my father? That's it."
tt0068646,"02:18:37,050","02:18:40,890","- Thank you, Papa. - I'm happy for you, Carlo."
tt0068646,"02:18:40,970","02:18:43,890",Mike... Why am I out?
tt0068646,"02:18:45,400","02:18:48,110","You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom."
tt0068646,"02:18:49,400","02:18:52,650",Things may get rough with the move.
tt0068646,"02:18:52,740","02:18:54,030",Tom.
tt0068646,"02:18:59,200","02:19:04,370",I advised Michael. I never thought you were a bad consigliere.
tt0068646,"02:19:04,460","02:19:08,590","I thought Santino was a bad Don, rest in peace."
tt0068646,"02:19:10,050","02:19:13,260","Michael has all my confidence, just as you do."
tt0068646,"02:19:14,260","02:19:19,220",But there are reasons why you must have no part in what is going to happen.
tt0068646,"02:19:20,260","02:19:23,310","- Maybe I could help. - You're out, Tom."
tt0068646,"02:20:12,480","02:20:16,780",I can't get over the way your face looks. So good!
tt0068646,"02:20:16,900","02:20:21,490","This doctor did some job. Did Kay talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!"
tt0068646,"02:20:21,570","02:20:25,700",Leave them out here. He's tired and wants to clean up.
tt0068646,"02:20:25,790","02:20:28,160","Let me open the door, all right?"
tt0068646,"02:20:34,340","02:20:39,760","- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas! - All for you, kid! It's all his idea."

tt0068646,"02:21:00,570","02:21:05,240","- Hey, Mike... - I'm here on business. Get rid of them."
tt0068646,"02:21:05,330","02:21:08,000",I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.
tt0068646,"02:21:13,880","02:21:17,170","Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go."
tt0068646,"02:21:17,260","02:21:19,380","Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo."
tt0068646,"02:21:21,090","02:21:23,220","Hey, come on! Scram!"
tt0068646,"02:21:24,890","02:21:28,430","Come on, honey. I don't know what's the matter with him, Johnny."
tt0068646,"02:21:28,520","02:21:29,810",Sorry.
tt0068646,"02:21:31,770","02:21:34,310",I don't know. He's tired.
tt0068646,"02:21:41,320","02:21:44,410",What happened to Moe Greene?
tt0068646,"02:21:44,490","02:21:48,830",He had some business. He said to give him a call when the party started.
tt0068646,"02:21:48,910","02:21:50,870","Well, give him a call."
tt0068646,"02:21:52,250","02:21:55,380",#NAME?
tt0068646,"02:21:55,460","02:21:57,670",- We're proud of you. - Thanks.
tt0068646,"02:21:57,750","02:22:01,340","Sit down, I want to talk to you. The Don is proud too."
tt0068646,"02:22:01,420","02:22:03,680","Well, I owe it all to him."
tt0068646,"02:22:04,890","02:22:06,470",He knows how grateful you are.
tt0068646,"02:22:06,550","02:22:09,810",That's why he'd like to ask a favor of you.
tt0068646,"02:22:09,890","02:22:11,810","Mike, what can I do?"
tt0068646,"02:22:12,980","02:22:15,440",We're thinking of giving up our interests
tt0068646,"02:22:15,520","02:22:18,440",in the olive oil business and settling here.
tt0068646,"02:22:19,280","02:22:24,610","Moe will sell us his share of the casino and the hotel, so we'll own all of it."
tt0068646,"02:22:24,700","02:22:27,450",- Tom! - Are you sure?
tt0068646,"02:22:27,530","02:22:30,540",Moe loves the business. He never said nothing about selling.
tt0068646,"02:22:30,620","02:22:33,330",I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
tt0068646,"02:22:34,620","02:22:37,040","See, Johnny..."
tt0068646,"02:22:37,130","02:22:41,340",We figure that entertainment would draw gamblers to the casino.
tt0068646,"02:22:41,420","02:22:45,180",We hope you'll sign a contract to appear five times a year.
tt0068646,"02:22:48,100","02:22:52,730",Perhaps convince some of your friends in the movies to do the same.
tt0068646,"02:22:53,980","02:22:56,100",We're counting on you.
tt0068646,"02:22:58,110","02:23:01,780","Sure, Mike. I'll do anything for my godfather."
tt0068646,"02:23:01,860","02:23:03,150",Good.
tt0068646,"02:23:04,780","02:23:09,410","Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows. Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom."
tt0068646,"02:23:09,490","02:23:12,040",#NAME?
tt0068646,"02:23:12,160","02:23:17,250","Have everything? Specially prepared food, the best dancers, and good credit."
tt0068646,"02:23:17,330","02:23:20,920","Draw chips for everybody, so they can play on the house."
tt0068646,"02:23:23,590","02:23:26,340",Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
tt0068646,"02:23:28,090","02:23:29,930",Buy me out?
tt0068646,"02:23:30,010","02:23:32,600","The casino, the hotel."
tt0068646,"02:23:32,680","02:23:35,600",The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
tt0068646,"02:23:35,690","02:23:41,110","The Corleone family wants to buy me out? No, I buy you out."
tt0068646,"02:23:41,190","02:23:44,610",Your casino loses money. We can do better.
tt0068646,"02:23:44,690","02:23:48,570",- You think I'm skimming off the top? - You're unlucky.
tt0068646,"02:23:53,370","02:23:55,790",You Guineas make me laugh.
tt0068646,"02:23:55,910","02:24:00,500","I took Freddy in when you had a bad time, and now you try to push me out!"
tt0068646,"02:24:01,880","02:24:05,300",You did that because we bankrolled your casino
tt0068646,"02:24:05,380","02:24:08,010",and the Molinari family guaranteed his safety.
tt0068646,"02:24:08,011","02:24:10,640",Let's talk business.
tt0068646,"02:24:10,720","02:24:13,470","Yes. First of all, you're all done."
tt0068646,"02:24:13,560","02:24:16,020",You don't have that kind of muscle anymore.
tt0068646,"02:24:16,140","02:24:20,520",The Godfather is sick. You're getting chased out of New York by the others.
tt0068646,"02:24:20,610","02:24:24,530",Do you think you can come to my hotel and take over?
tt0068646,"02:24:24,610","02:24:29,660",I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal with him and still keep my hotel!
tt0068646,"02:24:29,740","02:24:33,240",Is that why you slapped my brother around in public?
tt0068646,"02:24:33,330","02:24:38,160","That was nothing, Mike. Moe didn't mean nothing by that."
tt0068646,"02:24:38,250","02:24:42,460","He flies off the handle sometimes, but we're good friends."
tt0068646,"02:24:42,540","02:24:47,300",I have a business to run. I've got to kick asses sometimes.
tt0068646,"02:24:47,380","02:24:51,260","We had an argument, so I had to straighten him out."
tt0068646,"02:24:51,340","02:24:54,180",You straightened my brother out?
tt0068646,"02:24:54,260","02:24:58,730",He was banging cocktail waitresses! Players couldn't get a drink.
tt0068646,"02:24:58,810","02:25:00,770",What's wrong with you?
tt0068646,"02:25:05,650","02:25:08,780",I leave for New York tomorrow. Think about a price.
tt0068646,"02:25:09,700","02:25:11,320",Son-of-a-bitch!
tt0068646,"02:25:11,410","02:25:16,580",I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones when you were out with cheerleaders.
tt0068646,"02:25:16,660","02:25:19,160","Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea."
tt0068646,"02:25:20,290","02:25:23,840","Tom, you're the consigliere. Talk to the Don..."
tt0068646,"02:25:23,960","02:25:29,340",Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and Mike is in charge of the family business.
tt0068646,"02:25:29,420","02:25:32,760","If you have anything to say, say it to Michael."
tt0068646,"02:25:37,640","02:25:42,480","Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!"
tt0068646,"02:25:43,230","02:25:44,440",Fredo...
tt0068646,"02:25:45,650","02:25:48,400","You're my older brother, and I love you."
tt0068646,"02:25:49,860","02:25:53,870",But don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again.
tt0068646,"02:25:55,370","02:25:56,370",Ever.
tt0068646,"02:26:04,500","02:26:08,670","I have to see my father and his people, so have dinner without me."
tt0068646,"02:26:10,420","02:26:15,300","This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to the city, see a show and have dinner."
tt0068646,"02:26:22,690","02:26:25,730",Your sister wants to ask you something.
tt0068646,"02:26:25,810","02:26:27,940",- Let her ask. - She's afraid to.
tt0068646,"02:26:28,020","02:26:30,990",They want you to be godfather to their boy.
tt0068646,"02:26:31,070","02:26:32,900",- We'll see. - Will you?
tt0068646,"02:26:32,990","02:26:35,320",Let me think about it. Come on.
tt0068646,"02:26:44,210","02:26:47,080",Barzini will move against you first.
tt0068646,"02:26:47,170","02:26:51,590",He'll set up a meeting with someone you absolutely trust.
tt0068646,"02:26:51,670","02:26:53,720",Guaranteeing your safety.
tt0068646,"02:26:54,970","02:26:58,050",And at that meeting you'll be assassinated.
tt0068646,"02:27:02,770","02:27:05,770",I like to drink wine more than I used to.
tt0068646,"02:27:07,190","02:27:10,690","- Anyway, I'm drinking more. - It's good for you, Pop."
tt0068646,"02:27:15,740","02:27:17,240",I don't know.
tt0068646,"02:27:19,280","02:27:22,200",Are you happy with your wife and children?
tt0068646,"02:27:23,160","02:27:26,000",- Very happy. - That's good.
tt0068646,"02:27:27,880","02:27:32,760",I hope you don't mind the way I keep going over this Barzini business.
tt0068646,"02:27:32,840","02:27:35,800","- No, not at all. - It's an old habit."
tt0068646,"02:27:37,260","02:27:40,260",I spend my life trying not to be careless.
tt0068646,"02:27:41,810","02:27:45,270","Women and children can be careless, but not men."
tt0068646,"02:27:48,600","02:27:50,940",- How's your boy? - He's good.
tt0068646,"02:27:51,070","02:27:53,780",He looks more like you every day.
tt0068646,"02:27:56,490","02:28:00,950",He's smarter than I am. He's three and can read the funny papers.
tt0068646,"02:28:03,080","02:28:05,120",Read the funny papers.
tt0068646,"02:28:12,340","02:28:17,970",I want you to arrange for a telephone man to check all in-and out-going calls.
tt0068646,"02:28:18,090","02:28:20,740","I did it already. I took care of that, Pop."
tt0068646,"02:28:20,741","02:28:23,390",That's right. I forgot.
tt0068646,"02:28:27,440","02:28:29,150",What's the matter?
tt0068646,"02:28:29,980","02:28:32,020",What's bothering you?
tt0068646,"02:28:35,610","02:28:40,240","I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it, so I'll handle it."
tt0068646,"02:28:53,500","02:28:58,010",I knew that Santino would have to go through all this.
tt0068646,"02:28:58,090","02:28:59,720",And Fredo...
tt0068646,"02:29:02,430","02:29:04,470","Fredo was, well..."
tt0068646,"02:29:06,350","02:29:09,190",But I never wanted this for you.
tt0068646,"02:29:11,520","02:29:16,570",I worked my whole life. I don't apologize for taking care of my family.
tt0068646,"02:29:16,650","02:29:20,570","And I refused to be a fool,"
tt0068646,"02:29:20,660","02:29:24,780",dancing on a string held by all those big shots.
tt0068646,"02:29:26,740","02:29:30,210","I don't apologize. That's my life, but I thought that,"
tt0068646,"02:29:31,870","02:29:37,050","that when it was your time, you would be the one to hold the strings."
tt0068646,"02:29:38,840","02:29:44,510",Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone. Something.
tt0068646,"02:29:44,600","02:29:47,600",Another pezzonovante.
tt0068646,"02:29:47,680","02:29:49,350",Well...
tt0068646,"02:29:52,560","02:29:56,480","Just wasn't enough time, Michael. Wasn't enough time."
tt0068646,"02:29:56,570","02:30:00,070","We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there."
tt0068646,"02:30:04,910","02:30:09,370","Now listen, whoever comes to you with this Barzini meeting,"
tt0068646,"02:30:09,450","02:30:12,420",he's the traitor. Don't forget that.
tt0068646,"02:30:29,390","02:30:31,520","Can I hold it, please?"
tt0068646,"02:30:46,620","02:30:50,490",#NAME?
tt0068646,"02:30:50,580","02:30:53,370","Over here, over here."
tt0068646,"02:30:55,250","02:30:57,750",Be careful. You're spilling it.
tt0068646,"02:31:04,130","02:31:05,890",Anthony!
tt0068646,"02:31:05,970","02:31:07,640","Come here, come here."
tt0068646,"02:31:12,810","02:31:15,480",That's it. We'll put it right there.
tt0068646,"02:31:20,690","02:31:23,280",I'll show you something. Come here.
tt0068646,"02:31:25,320","02:31:27,200",Stand there.
tt0068646,"02:31:30,950","02:31:32,700",Give me an orange!
tt0068646,"02:31:51,060","02:31:52,850",That's a new trick.
tt0068646,"02:31:53,850","02:31:56,190",You run in there. Run in there.
tt0068646,"02:32:09,740","02:32:11,700",Where are you?
tt0068646,"02:35:09,380","02:35:11,760","Mike, can I have a minute?"
tt0068646,"02:35:21,850","02:35:24,310",Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.
tt0068646,"02:35:24,390","02:35:27,690",He says we can straighten out any of our problems.
tt0068646,"02:35:28,360","02:35:30,570",#NAME?
tt0068646,"02:35:31,900","02:35:35,700",I can arrange security. On my territory.

tt0068646,"02:35:58,800","02:36:01,760",Do you know how they're going to come at you?
tt0068646,"02:36:04,270","02:36:07,940",They're arranging a meeting in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.
tt0068646,"02:36:10,110","02:36:11,900",Where I'll be safe.
tt0068646,"02:36:24,160","02:36:27,750","I always thought it would be Clemenza, not Tessio."
tt0068646,"02:36:27,830","02:36:31,630",It's the smart move. Tessio was always smarter.
tt0068646,"02:36:33,880","02:36:35,170",But I'm going to wait.
tt0068646,"02:36:35,840","02:36:36,840",After the baptism.
tt0068646,"02:36:40,720","02:36:44,310",I've decided to be godfather to Connie's baby.
tt0068646,"02:36:44,390","02:36:48,560",And then I'll meet with Don Barzini and Tattaglia.
tt0068646,"02:36:50,150","02:36:53,110",All the heads of the five families.
tt0068646,"02:39:14,080","02:39:19,040","Michael, do you believe in God, the Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?"
tt0068646,"02:39:19,130","02:39:20,300",I do.
tt0068646,"02:39:20,380","02:39:23,880","Do you believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord?"
tt0068646,"02:39:23,970","02:39:24,970",I do.
tt0068646,"02:39:25,050","02:39:29,100","Do you believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy Catholic Church?"
tt0068646,"02:39:29,180","02:39:30,470",I do.
tt0068646,"02:40:36,040","02:40:40,380","Michael Francis Rizzi, do you renounce Satan?"
tt0068646,"02:40:46,630","02:40:47,880",I do renounce him.
tt0068646,"02:40:57,560","02:40:58,980",And all his works?
tt0068646,"02:41:12,870","02:41:13,910",I do renounce them.
tt0068646,"02:41:15,660","02:41:16,910","Oh, God!"

tt0068646,"02:41:51,910","02:41:57,410","Michael Rizzi, go in peace, and may the Lord be with you. Amen."

tt0133093,"00:08:27,765","00:08:29,756",#NAME?
tt0133093,"00:08:30,005","00:08:31,961",You look a little whiter than usual.
tt0133093,"00:08:33,045","00:08:35,115","My computer, it..."
tt0133093,"00:08:38,005","00:08:42,362",Ever have that feeling where you're not sure if you're awake or dreaming?
tt0133093,"00:08:43,125","00:08:45,764",All the time. It's called mescaline.
tt0133093,"00:08:46,245","00:08:48,281",It's the only way to fly.
tt0133093,"00:08:49,125","00:08:51,514",It just sounds like you need to unplug.
tt0133093,"00:08:52,245","00:08:54,201",Get some R and R?
tt0133093,"00:08:54,565","00:08:58,160","What do you think, Dujour? Should we take him with us?"
tt0133093,"00:09:00,085","00:09:01,234",Definitely.
tt0133093,"00:09:01,485","00:09:04,522","No, I can't. I have work tomorrow."
tt0133093,"00:09:05,045","00:09:06,114",Come on.
tt0133093,"00:09:06,365","00:09:08,879",It'll be fun. I promise.
tt0133093,"00:09:15,125","00:09:16,558",Yeah.
tt0133093,"00:09:17,365","00:09:19,162",Sure. I'll go.
tt0133093,"00:09:45,725","00:09:46,635","Hello, Neo."
tt0133093,"00:09:48,125","00:09:49,035",How do you know that name?
tt0133093,"00:09:49,845","00:09:51,483",I know a lot about you.
tt0133093,"00:09:52,325","00:09:53,121",Who are you?
tt0133093,"00:09:53,365","00:09:54,320",My name is Trinity.
tt0133093,"00:09:55,245","00:09:56,394",Trinity.
tt0133093,"00:09:58,125","00:09:59,080",The Trinity?
tt0133093,"00:09:59,525","00:10:01,163",That cracked the IRS D-base?
tt0133093,"00:10:01,405","00:10:02,804",That was a long time ago.
tt0133093,"00:10:03,045","00:10:03,841",Jesus.
tt0133093,"00:10:04,085","00:10:04,881",What?
tt0133093,"00:10:05,325","00:10:07,043",I just thought...
tt0133093,"00:10:08,725","00:10:09,840",...you were a guy.
tt0133093,"00:10:10,085","00:10:11,484",Most guys do.
tt0133093,"00:10:12,645","00:10:14,761",That was you on my computer.
tt0133093,"00:10:15,365","00:10:16,434",How did you do that?
tt0133093,"00:10:17,045","00:10:19,639","Right now, all I can tell you..."
tt0133093,"00:10:20,245","00:10:21,724",...is that you're in danger.
tt0133093,"00:10:22,165","00:10:24,474",#NAME?
tt0133093,"00:10:25,045","00:10:26,637","They're watching you, Neo."
tt0133093,"00:10:27,205","00:10:28,001",Who is?
tt0133093,"00:10:28,205","00:10:29,524",Please just listen.
tt0133093,"00:10:32,885","00:10:34,637","I know why you're here, Neo."
tt0133093,"00:10:35,405","00:10:37,282",I know what you've been doing.
tt0133093,"00:10:37,525","00:10:39,322",I know why you hardly sleep...
tt0133093,"00:10:39,605","00:10:42,597","...why you live alone and why, night after night..."
tt0133093,"00:10:42,845","00:10:45,075",...you sit at your computer.
tt0133093,"00:10:46,205","00:10:47,684",You're looking for him.
tt0133093,"00:10:48,445","00:10:51,323","I know, because I was once looking for the same thing."
tt0133093,"00:10:51,805","00:10:53,841",And when he found me...
tt0133093,"00:10:54,445","00:10:57,403",...he told me I wasn't really looking for him...
tt0133093,"00:10:58,285","00:10:59,957",...I was looking for an answer.
tt0133093,"00:11:00,565","00:11:03,557","It's the question that drives us, Neo."
tt0133093,"00:11:04,205","00:11:06,765",It's the question that brought you here.
tt0133093,"00:11:08,765","00:11:10,084",You know the question...
tt0133093,"00:11:10,325","00:11:11,758",...just as I did.
tt0133093,"00:11:13,245","00:11:14,803",What is the Matrix?
tt0133093,"00:11:15,045","00:11:17,400","The answer is out there, Neo."
tt0133093,"00:11:18,045","00:11:19,956",It's looking for you.
tt0133093,"00:11:20,725","00:11:22,363",And it will find you...
tt0133093,"00:11:22,605","00:11:24,516",...if you want it to.
tt0133093,"00:11:31,045","00:11:31,841",Shit.
tt0133093,"00:11:32,085","00:11:33,279","Shit, shit."
tt0133093,"00:11:43,125","00:11:45,844","You have a problem with authority, Mr. Anderson."
tt0133093,"00:11:46,085","00:11:49,964","You believe that you are special, that the rules do not apply to you."
tt0133093,"00:11:50,645","00:11:52,556","Obviously, you are mistaken."
tt0133093,"00:11:55,405","00:11:58,158",This is one of the top software companies in the world...
tt0133093,"00:11:58,405","00:12:01,636",...because employees understand they are part of a whole.
tt0133093,"00:12:01,885","00:12:06,322","Thus, if an employee has a problem, the company has a problem."
tt0133093,"00:12:08,485","00:12:11,557","The time has come to make a choice, Mr. Anderson."
tt0133093,"00:12:12,405","00:12:16,114",Either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forth...
tt0133093,"00:12:16,725","00:12:19,193",...or you choose to find another job.
tt0133093,"00:12:20,045","00:12:21,319",Do I make myself clear?
tt0133093,"00:12:21,565","00:12:23,874","Yes, Mr. Rhineheart. Perfectly clear."
tt0133093,"00:12:32,005","00:12:32,801",Thomas Anderson?
tt0133093,"00:12:35,005","00:12:36,358","Yeah, that's me."
tt0133093,"00:12:44,045","00:12:45,160",Great.
tt0133093,"00:12:46,525","00:12:47,640",Have a nice day.
tt0133093,"00:13:03,765","00:13:06,962","<i>Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?</i>"
tt0133093,"00:13:09,125","00:13:10,797",<i>- Morpheus. - Yes.</i>
tt0133093,"00:13:11,045","00:13:12,956",<i>I've been looking for you.</i>
tt0133093,"00:13:13,205","00:13:16,242",<i>I don 't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you.</i>
tt0133093,"00:13:16,485","00:13:19,522","<i>But unfortunately, you and I have run out of time.</i>"
tt0133093,"00:13:19,765","00:13:23,314","<i>They're coming for you, and I don 't know what they're going to do.</i>"
tt0133093,"00:13:23,565","00:13:24,839",Who's coming for me?
tt0133093,"00:13:25,085","00:13:27,076",<i>Stand up and see for yourself.</i>
tt0133093,"00:13:27,325","00:13:28,758",What? Right now?
tt0133093,"00:13:29,045","00:13:30,000",<i>Yes.</i>
tt0133093,"00:13:30,245","00:13:31,439",<i>Now.</i>
tt0133093,"00:13:32,285","00:13:34,082",<i>Do it slowly.</i>
tt0133093,"00:13:34,485","00:13:35,634",<i>The elevator.</i>
tt0133093,"00:13:40,325","00:13:42,043","Oh, shit!"
tt0133093,"00:13:46,525","00:13:47,480",What do they want?
tt0133093,"00:13:47,725","00:13:51,240","<i>I don 't know. If you don 't want to find out, get out of there.</i>"
tt0133093,"00:13:51,485","00:13:52,076",How?
tt0133093,"00:13:52,285","00:13:55,322","<i>I can guide you, but you must do exactly as I say.</i>"
tt0133093,"00:13:56,165","00:13:58,076",<i>The cubicle across from you is empty.</i>
tt0133093,"00:14:01,085","00:14:03,121",<i>- But what if they... - Go. Now.</i>
tt0133093,"00:14:09,605","00:14:11,880",<i>Stay here for just a moment.</i>
tt0133093,"00:14:18,805","00:14:21,444","<i>When I tell you, go to the end of the row...</i>"
tt0133093,"00:14:21,685","00:14:23,562",<i>... to the office at the end of the hall.</i>
tt0133093,"00:14:23,805","00:14:26,080",<i>Stay as low as you can.</i>
tt0133093,"00:14:28,405","00:14:29,360",<i>Go. Now.</i>
tt0133093,"00:14:43,165","00:14:46,555","<i>Good. Now, outside there is a scaffold.</i>"
tt0133093,"00:14:49,165","00:14:51,395",<i>- How do you know this? - We don 't have time.</i>
tt0133093,"00:14:51,645","00:14:54,364",<i>To your left there's a window. Go to it.</i>
tt0133093,"00:14:56,525","00:14:58,004",<i>Open it.</i>
tt0133093,"00:14:58,805","00:15:00,523",<i>Take the scaffold to the roof.</i>
tt0133093,"00:15:00,765","00:15:03,233",No way! No way! This is crazy!
tt0133093,"00:15:03,485","00:15:05,760",<i>There are two ways out of this building.</i>
tt0133093,"00:15:06,005","00:15:09,634",<i>One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.</i>
tt0133093,"00:15:09,885","00:15:12,957",<i>You take a chance either way. I leave it to you.</i>
tt0133093,"00:15:16,405","00:15:18,077",This is insane!
tt0133093,"00:15:19,205","00:15:21,002",Why is this happening to me?
tt0133093,"00:15:21,285","00:15:22,843",What'd I do?
tt0133093,"00:15:23,205","00:15:25,844",I'm nobody. I didn't do anything.
tt0133093,"00:15:26,405","00:15:27,804",I'm gonna die.
tt0133093,"00:15:37,205","00:15:38,194",Shit!
tt0133093,"00:15:57,645","00:15:58,714","Oh, shit!"
tt0133093,"00:16:03,485","00:16:05,203",I can't do this.
tt0133093,"00:16:17,525","00:16:18,321",Shit.
tt0133093,"00:17:05,565","00:17:10,195","As you can see, we've had our eye on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson."
tt0133093,"00:17:11,445","00:17:14,005",It seems that you've been living...
tt0133093,"00:17:14,245","00:17:16,281",...two lives.
tt0133093,"00:17:17,645","00:17:20,034","In one life, you're Thomas A. Anderson..."
tt0133093,"00:17:20,285","00:17:23,482",...program writer for a respectable software company.
tt0133093,"00:17:24,485","00:17:27,636",You have a social security number. You pay your taxes.
tt0133093,"00:17:28,085","00:17:29,279",And you...
tt0133093,"00:17:30,805","00:17:34,275",...help your landlady carry out her garbage.
tt0133093,"00:17:36,685","00:17:39,677",The other life is lived in computers...
tt0133093,"00:17:39,965","00:17:42,798","...where you go by the hacker alias ""Neo""..."
tt0133093,"00:17:43,045","00:17:47,641",...and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for.
tt0133093,"00:17:48,885","00:17:50,762",One of these lives...
tt0133093,"00:17:51,005","00:17:52,757",...has a future.
tt0133093,"00:17:53,085","00:17:54,996",And one of them does not.
tt0133093,"00:17:58,565","00:18:02,240","I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be, Mr. Anderson."
tt0133093,"00:18:03,205","00:18:04,479",You're here...
tt0133093,"00:18:04,805","00:18:06,955",...because we need your help.
tt0133093,"00:18:10,445","00:18:13,323",We know that you've been contacted by a certain...
tt0133093,"00:18:13,565","00:18:15,283",...individual.
tt0133093,"00:18:16,165","00:18:20,044","A man who calls himself ""Morpheus."""
tt0133093,"00:18:21,005","00:18:24,839",Whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant.
tt0133093,"00:18:25,085","00:18:27,394",He is considered by many authorities...
tt0133093,"00:18:27,645","00:18:30,557",...to be the most dangerous man alive.
tt0133093,"00:18:33,205","00:18:34,354",My colleagues...
tt0133093,"00:18:34,765","00:18:37,563",...believe that I am wasting my time with you.
tt0133093,"00:18:37,845","00:18:41,121",But I believe you wish to do the right thing.
tt0133093,"00:18:41,405","00:18:44,761",We're willing to wipe the slate clean...
tt0133093,"00:18:45,125","00:18:47,161",...give you a fresh start.
tt0133093,"00:18:47,645","00:18:50,443",All we're asking in return is your cooperation...
tt0133093,"00:18:50,685","00:18:54,041",...in bringing a known terrorist to justice.
tt0133093,"00:18:55,365","00:18:56,559",Yeah.
tt0133093,"00:18:57,805","00:18:59,796",That sounds like a really good deal.
tt0133093,"00:19:01,365","00:19:03,037",But I got a better one.
tt0133093,"00:19:03,285","00:19:04,718",How about...
tt0133093,"00:19:05,125","00:19:07,036",...I give you the finger...
tt0133093,"00:19:09,525","00:19:11,481",...and you give me my phone call.
tt0133093,"00:19:13,565","00:19:15,317",Mr. Anderson...
tt0133093,"00:19:19,525","00:19:20,321",...you disappoint me.
tt0133093,"00:19:20,565","00:19:23,079",You can't scare me with this gestapo crap.
tt0133093,"00:19:23,325","00:19:24,644",I know my rights.
tt0133093,"00:19:24,885","00:19:26,318",I want my phone call.
tt0133093,"00:19:26,885","00:19:28,955","Tell me, Mr. Anderson..."
tt0133093,"00:19:29,805","00:19:31,158",...what good is a phone call...
tt0133093,"00:19:31,405","00:19:34,841",...if you're unable to speak?
tt0133093,"00:20:07,245","00:20:09,361","You're going to help us, Mr. Anderson..."
tt0133093,"00:20:10,045","00:20:10,955",...whether you want to...
tt0133093,"00:20:11,205","00:20:12,035",...or not.
tt0133093,"00:21:07,965","00:21:11,082","<i>This line is tapped, so I must be brief.</i>"
tt0133093,"00:21:11,325","00:21:15,443","<i>They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.</i>"
tt0133093,"00:21:15,685","00:21:17,437",<i>If they knew what I know...</i>
tt0133093,"00:21:17,685","00:21:19,596",<i>... you would probably be dead.</i>
tt0133093,"00:21:20,565","00:21:24,114",What are you talking about? What is happening to me?
tt0133093,"00:21:24,365","00:21:28,995","<i>You are the One, Neo. You may have spent the last few years...</i>"
tt0133093,"00:21:29,245","00:21:32,078","<i>... looking for me, but I've spent my entire life...</i>"
tt0133093,"00:21:32,325","00:21:33,758",<i>... looking for you.</i>
tt0133093,"00:21:35,245","00:21:37,315","<i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>"
tt0133093,"00:21:38,245","00:21:40,998",<i>- Yes. - Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>
tt0133093,"00:21:50,805","00:21:51,954",Get in.
tt0133093,"00:22:03,725","00:22:04,521",What's this?
tt0133093,"00:22:04,765","00:22:07,199","It's necessary, Neo. For our protection."
tt0133093,"00:22:07,445","00:22:08,400",From what?
tt0133093,"00:22:08,645","00:22:09,521",From you.
tt0133093,"00:22:11,005","00:22:12,404",Take off your shirt.
tt0133093,"00:22:12,885","00:22:13,681",Stop the car.
tt0133093,"00:22:18,085","00:22:19,200","Listen, coppertop."
tt0133093,"00:22:19,445","00:22:21,356",We don't have time for 20 Questions.
tt0133093,"00:22:21,845","00:22:24,120","Right now, there's only one rule:"
tt0133093,"00:22:24,405","00:22:25,679",Our way...
tt0133093,"00:22:26,005","00:22:27,040",...or the highway.
tt0133093,"00:22:33,525","00:22:34,355",Fine.
tt0133093,"00:22:36,165","00:22:38,520","Please, Neo, you have to trust me."
tt0133093,"00:22:39,085","00:22:41,599",#NAME?
tt0133093,"00:22:42,325","00:22:43,474",You know that road.
tt0133093,"00:22:44,445","00:22:46,037",You know exactly where it ends.
tt0133093,"00:22:48,125","00:22:50,275",And I know that's not where you want to be.
tt0133093,"00:23:03,885","00:23:05,364","Apoc, lights."
tt0133093,"00:23:07,765","00:23:09,835",Lie back. Lift up your shirt.
tt0133093,"00:23:11,685","00:23:12,481",What's that?
tt0133093,"00:23:12,805","00:23:13,840",You're bugged.
tt0133093,"00:23:21,285","00:23:22,684",Try and relax.
tt0133093,"00:23:28,725","00:23:29,840",Come on.
tt0133093,"00:23:31,005","00:23:31,835",Come on.
tt0133093,"00:23:33,565","00:23:34,441",It's on the move.
tt0133093,"00:23:36,205","00:23:37,354","Come on, you shit."
tt0133093,"00:23:39,125","00:23:41,320","- You're gonna lose it. - No, I'm not."
tt0133093,"00:23:41,565","00:23:42,475",Clear!
tt0133093,"00:23:50,725","00:23:52,761",Jesus Christ! That thing's real?!
tt0133093,"00:24:25,125","00:24:26,399",This is it.
tt0133093,"00:24:29,605","00:24:31,960",Let me give you one piece of advice.
tt0133093,"00:24:32,885","00:24:34,477",Be honest.
tt0133093,"00:24:36,005","00:24:38,121",He knows more than you can imagine.
tt0133093,"00:24:46,485","00:24:47,759",At last.
tt0133093,"00:24:49,245","00:24:50,280","Welcome, Neo."
tt0133093,"00:24:51,445","00:24:53,276",As you no doubt have guessed...
tt0133093,"00:24:53,525","00:24:54,719",...I am Morpheus.
tt0133093,"00:24:55,725","00:24:57,238",It's an honor to meet you.
tt0133093,"00:24:57,685","00:24:58,674",No...
tt0133093,"00:24:59,245","00:25:00,473",...the honor is mine.
tt0133093,"00:25:01,365","00:25:03,754","Please, come. Sit."
tt0133093,"00:25:18,245","00:25:19,803",I imagine...
tt0133093,"00:25:20,205","00:25:22,844",...that right now you're feeling a bit like Alice...
tt0133093,"00:25:24,485","00:25:26,794",...tumbling down the rabbit hole?
tt0133093,"00:25:27,685","00:25:28,640",You could say that.
tt0133093,"00:25:29,525","00:25:32,039",I can see it in your eyes.
tt0133093,"00:25:32,605","00:25:35,756",You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees...
tt0133093,"00:25:36,005","00:25:38,155",...because he's expecting to wake up.
tt0133093,"00:25:39,525","00:25:42,039","Ironically, this is not far from the truth."
tt0133093,"00:25:42,685","00:25:45,074","Do you believe in fate, Neo?"
tt0133093,"00:25:45,365","00:25:46,195",No.
tt0133093,"00:25:46,645","00:25:47,555",Why not?
tt0133093,"00:25:47,805","00:25:50,478",I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
tt0133093,"00:25:51,525","00:25:54,722",I know exactly what you mean.
tt0133093,"00:25:58,845","00:26:01,120",Let me tell you why you're here.
tt0133093,"00:26:02,125","00:26:03,604",You know something.
tt0133093,"00:26:04,125","00:26:05,683","What you know, you can't explain."
tt0133093,"00:26:06,165","00:26:07,678",But you feel it.
tt0133093,"00:26:08,245","00:26:10,076",You felt it your entire life.
tt0133093,"00:26:10,645","00:26:14,638","Something's wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there."
tt0133093,"00:26:15,125","00:26:17,241",Like a splinter in your mind...
tt0133093,"00:26:17,485","00:26:19,282",...driving you mad.
tt0133093,"00:26:20,165","00:26:22,804",It is this feeling that has brought you to me.
tt0133093,"00:26:25,245","00:26:26,997",Do you know what I'm talking about?
tt0133093,"00:26:28,765","00:26:30,039",The Matrix?
tt0133093,"00:26:32,445","00:26:34,037",Do you want to know...
tt0133093,"00:26:34,485","00:26:36,396",...what it is?
tt0133093,"00:26:38,685","00:26:40,482",The Matrix is everywhere.
tt0133093,"00:26:40,725","00:26:42,363",It is all around us.
tt0133093,"00:26:42,605","00:26:44,482","Even now, in this very room."
tt0133093,"00:26:45,285","00:26:47,401",You can see it when you look out your window...
tt0133093,"00:26:47,645","00:26:49,875",...or when you turn on your television.
tt0133093,"00:26:50,285","00:26:52,719",You can feel it when you go to work...
tt0133093,"00:26:54,205","00:26:55,797",...when you go to church...
tt0133093,"00:26:56,205","00:26:58,196",...when you pay your taxes.
tt0133093,"00:26:59,285","00:27:02,083",It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes...
tt0133093,"00:27:02,325","00:27:03,838",...to blind you from the truth.
tt0133093,"00:27:05,965","00:27:07,159",What truth?
tt0133093,"00:27:11,245","00:27:12,724",That you are a slave.
tt0133093,"00:27:14,165","00:27:16,360","Like everyone else, you were born into bondage..."
tt0133093,"00:27:16,605","00:27:21,076",...born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch.
tt0133093,"00:27:21,365","00:27:22,593",A prison...
tt0133093,"00:27:22,845","00:27:23,960",...for your mind.
tt0133093,"00:27:30,645","00:27:32,875","Unfortunately, no one can be..."
tt0133093,"00:27:33,205","00:27:35,480",...told what the Matrix is.
tt0133093,"00:27:38,805","00:27:40,602",You have to see it for yourself.
tt0133093,"00:27:49,725","00:27:51,920",This is your last chance.
tt0133093,"00:27:52,165","00:27:54,395","After this, there is no turning back."
tt0133093,"00:27:54,845","00:27:56,278",You take the blue pill...
tt0133093,"00:27:56,565","00:27:59,477","...the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe..."
tt0133093,"00:27:59,725","00:28:01,443",...whatever you want to believe.
tt0133093,"00:28:01,685","00:28:02,959",You take the red pill...
tt0133093,"00:28:03,205","00:28:05,082",...you stay in Wonderland...
tt0133093,"00:28:05,565","00:28:08,159",...and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
tt0133093,"00:28:17,645","00:28:18,794",Remember...
tt0133093,"00:28:19,605","00:28:22,517",...all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.
tt0133093,"00:28:36,245","00:28:37,519",Follow me.
tt0133093,"00:28:39,965","00:28:41,557","Apoc, are we on-line?"
tt0133093,"00:28:41,805","00:28:43,124",Almost.
tt0133093,"00:28:46,325","00:28:48,281",Time is always against us.
tt0133093,"00:28:48,645","00:28:50,078",Please take a seat there.
tt0133093,"00:29:07,525","00:29:09,163",You did all this?
tt0133093,"00:29:13,125","00:29:15,036",The pill you took is part of a trace program.
tt0133093,"00:29:15,765","00:29:20,202",It disrupts your carrier signals so we can pinpoint your location.
tt0133093,"00:29:20,725","00:29:21,714",What does that mean?
tt0133093,"00:29:22,285","00:29:24,355","It means buckle your seat belt, Dorothy..."
tt0133093,"00:29:24,685","00:29:25,959",...because Kansas...
tt0133093,"00:29:26,205","00:29:27,194",...is going bye-bye.
tt0133093,"00:30:03,565","00:30:04,884",Did you...?
tt0133093,"00:30:15,445","00:30:19,358","Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?"
tt0133093,"00:30:20,765","00:30:23,233",What if you were unable to wake from that dream?
tt0133093,"00:30:23,485","00:30:25,874",How would you know the difference between the dream world...
tt0133093,"00:30:26,485","00:30:27,838",...and the real world?
tt0133093,"00:30:29,405","00:30:30,554",This can't be.
tt0133093,"00:30:30,805","00:30:31,681",Be what?
tt0133093,"00:30:32,365","00:30:33,798",Be real?
tt0133093,"00:30:37,605","00:30:38,833",Going into replication.
tt0133093,"00:30:39,285","00:30:40,115",Still nothing.
tt0133093,"00:30:40,685","00:30:41,834",It's cold.
tt0133093,"00:30:42,085","00:30:43,404",It's cold!
tt0133093,"00:30:47,125","00:30:48,717","Tank, we'll need a signal soon."
tt0133093,"00:30:50,205","00:30:51,001",I got a fibrillation.
tt0133093,"00:30:51,245","00:30:52,724","Apoc, location."
tt0133093,"00:30:52,965","00:30:54,364",Targeting almost there.
tt0133093,"00:30:57,525","00:30:58,878",He's going into arrest.
tt0133093,"00:30:59,125","00:30:59,921",Lock. I got him!
tt0133093,"00:31:00,125","00:31:01,524","Now, Tank, now!"
tt0133093,"00:33:51,517","00:33:52,552",Welcome...
tt0133093,"00:33:52,877","00:33:54,708",...to the real world.
tt0133093,"00:33:56,077","00:33:57,829","We've done it, Trinity."
tt0133093,"00:33:58,077","00:33:59,556",We found him.
tt0133093,"00:33:59,797","00:34:02,470",- I hope you're right. - I don't have to hope.
tt0133093,"00:34:03,037","00:34:04,550",I know it.
tt0133093,"00:34:09,517","00:34:10,506",Am I dead?
tt0133093,"00:34:10,997","00:34:13,067",Far from it.
tt0133093,"00:34:26,477","00:34:27,830",He still needs a lot of work.
tt0133093,"00:34:29,317","00:34:30,352",What are you doing?
tt0133093,"00:34:30,597","00:34:32,713",Your muscles atrophied. We're rebuilding them.
tt0133093,"00:34:33,277","00:34:34,756",Why do my eyes hurt?
tt0133093,"00:34:35,437","00:34:37,234",You've never used them before.
tt0133093,"00:34:41,037","00:34:41,833","Rest, Neo."
tt0133093,"00:34:42,077","00:34:43,669",The answers are coming.
tt0133093,"00:35:55,197","00:35:56,710","Morpheus, what's happened to me?"
tt0133093,"00:35:57,437","00:35:58,347",What is this place?
tt0133093,"00:35:58,597","00:36:01,157","More important than ""what"" is ""when."""
tt0133093,"00:36:01,837","00:36:02,633",When?
tt0133093,"00:36:02,837","00:36:04,793",You believe it's the year 1999...
tt0133093,"00:36:05,037","00:36:07,187","...when in fact, it's closer to 2199."
tt0133093,"00:36:08,277","00:36:10,916",I can't tell you exactly what year it is...
tt0133093,"00:36:11,157","00:36:12,715",...because we honestly don't know.
tt0133093,"00:36:13,197","00:36:15,916",There's nothing I can say that will explain it for you.
tt0133093,"00:36:16,157","00:36:17,272",Come with me.
tt0133093,"00:36:17,557","00:36:18,785",See for yourself.
tt0133093,"00:36:19,317","00:36:20,989",This is my ship.
tt0133093,"00:36:21,277","00:36:24,075",<i>The Nebuchadnezzar. It's a hovercraft.</i>
tt0133093,"00:36:26,797","00:36:28,469",This is the main deck.
tt0133093,"00:36:34,237","00:36:35,192",This is the core...
tt0133093,"00:36:37,597","00:36:41,192",...where we broadcast our pirate signal and hack into the Matrix.
tt0133093,"00:36:44,437","00:36:47,474",Most of my crew you already know.
tt0133093,"00:36:52,277","00:36:53,630",This is Apoc...
tt0133093,"00:36:54,397","00:36:55,671",...Switch...
tt0133093,"00:36:57,197","00:36:58,312",...and Cypher.
tt0133093,"00:36:58,557","00:37:02,106","The ones you don't know: Tank and his big brother, Dozer."
tt0133093,"00:37:02,957","00:37:05,266",The little one behind you is Mouse.
tt0133093,"00:37:09,437","00:37:12,554",You wanted to know what the Matrix is?
tt0133093,"00:37:13,557","00:37:14,706",Trinity.
tt0133093,"00:37:34,877","00:37:36,390",Try to relax.
tt0133093,"00:37:41,077","00:37:42,829",This will feel a little weird.
tt0133093,"00:37:54,317","00:37:55,432",This...
tt0133093,"00:37:55,797","00:37:57,435",...is the Construct.
tt0133093,"00:37:57,837","00:37:59,873",It's our loading program.
tt0133093,"00:38:00,117","00:38:02,472","We can load anything, from clothing..."
tt0133093,"00:38:02,717","00:38:04,036",...to equipment...
tt0133093,"00:38:04,317","00:38:05,591",...weapons...
tt0133093,"00:38:06,197","00:38:07,949",...training simulations...
tt0133093,"00:38:08,317","00:38:10,751",...anything we need.
tt0133093,"00:38:13,437","00:38:15,746",Right now we're inside a computer program?
tt0133093,"00:38:16,037","00:38:17,868",Is it really so hard to believe?
tt0133093,"00:38:18,357","00:38:20,871",Your clothes are different. The plugs in your body are gone.
tt0133093,"00:38:22,037","00:38:24,028",Your hair has changed.
tt0133093,"00:38:24,397","00:38:27,594","Your appearance now is what we call ""residual self-image."""
tt0133093,"00:38:28,277","00:38:30,791",It is the mental projection of your digital self.
tt0133093,"00:38:36,437","00:38:37,506",This isn't real?
tt0133093,"00:38:37,757","00:38:39,236","What is ""real""?"
tt0133093,"00:38:39,597","00:38:41,747","How do you define ""real""?"
tt0133093,"00:38:42,037","00:38:43,868",If you're talking about what you can feel...
tt0133093,"00:38:44,117","00:38:46,426","...what you can smell, taste and see..."
tt0133093,"00:38:46,677","00:38:50,386","...then ""real"" is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain."
tt0133093,"00:38:54,397","00:38:56,706",This is the world that you know.
tt0133093,"00:38:58,077","00:39:00,989",The world as it was at the end of the 20th century.
tt0133093,"00:39:03,277","00:39:07,429",It exists now only as part of a neural-interactive simulation...
tt0133093,"00:39:07,677","00:39:08,871",...that we call the Matrix.
tt0133093,"00:39:13,237","00:39:15,956","You've been living in a dream world, Neo."
tt0133093,"00:39:16,877","00:39:17,946",This is the world...
tt0133093,"00:39:18,237","00:39:19,955",...as it exists today.
tt0133093,"00:39:32,437","00:39:35,270","Welcome to ""the desert..."
tt0133093,"00:39:36,117","00:39:37,630","...of the real."""
tt0133093,"00:39:40,877","00:39:43,152",We have only bits and pieces of information.
tt0133093,"00:39:43,397","00:39:47,026",But what we know for certain is that in the early 21 st century...
tt0133093,"00:39:47,277","00:39:50,394",...all of mankind was united in celebration.
tt0133093,"00:39:50,637","00:39:55,188",We marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to Al.
tt0133093,"00:39:55,957","00:39:57,026",Al.
tt0133093,"00:39:58,037","00:39:59,356",You mean artificial intelligence.
tt0133093,"00:39:59,597","00:40:03,829",A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines.
tt0133093,"00:40:04,637","00:40:07,947","We don't know who struck first, us or them."
tt0133093,"00:40:08,357","00:40:11,429",But we know that it was us that scorched the sky.
tt0133093,"00:40:13,037","00:40:15,107",They were dependent on solar power...
tt0133093,"00:40:15,357","00:40:18,554",...and it was believed that they would be unable to survive...
tt0133093,"00:40:18,877","00:40:22,233",...without an energy source as abundant as the sun.
tt0133093,"00:40:22,477","00:40:27,153","Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive."
tt0133093,"00:40:28,557","00:40:32,596","Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony."
tt0133093,"00:40:35,677","00:40:39,909",The human body generates more bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.
tt0133093,"00:40:40,157","00:40:44,116","And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat."
tt0133093,"00:40:45,957","00:40:48,027",Combined with a form of fusion...
tt0133093,"00:40:48,357","00:40:52,987",...the machines had found all the energy they would ever need.
tt0133093,"00:40:56,877","00:41:00,472","There are fields, Neo, endless fields..."
tt0133093,"00:41:00,717","00:41:03,834",...where human beings are no longer born.
tt0133093,"00:41:04,517","00:41:06,269",We are grown.
tt0133093,"00:41:12,077","00:41:14,545","For the longest time, I wouldn't believe it."
tt0133093,"00:41:14,797","00:41:17,357",And then I saw the fields with my own eyes...
tt0133093,"00:41:18,637","00:41:20,195",...watched them liquefy the dead...
tt0133093,"00:41:20,437","00:41:23,634",...so they could be fed intravenously to the living.
tt0133093,"00:41:24,157","00:41:28,230","And standing there, facing the pure, horrifying precision..."
tt0133093,"00:41:28,477","00:41:31,275",...I came to realize the obviousness of the truth.
tt0133093,"00:41:33,797","00:41:35,515",What is the Matrix?
tt0133093,"00:41:36,677","00:41:37,666",Control.
tt0133093,"00:41:38,997","00:41:42,228",The Matrix is a computer-generated dream world...
tt0133093,"00:41:42,997","00:41:45,955",...built to keep us under control...
tt0133093,"00:41:47,077","00:41:50,114",...in order to change a human being...
tt0133093,"00:41:50,717","00:41:51,832",...into this.
tt0133093,"00:41:53,157","00:41:54,226",No.
tt0133093,"00:41:55,797","00:41:57,310",I don't believe it.
tt0133093,"00:41:57,677","00:41:58,826",It's not possible.
tt0133093,"00:41:59,397","00:42:03,788","I didn't say it would be easy, Neo. I just said it would be the truth."
tt0133093,"00:42:04,037","00:42:04,833",Stop!
tt0133093,"00:42:05,797","00:42:06,946",Let me out!
tt0133093,"00:42:07,637","00:42:09,468",Let me out! I want out!
tt0133093,"00:42:11,357","00:42:13,917",#NAME?
tt0133093,"00:42:14,157","00:42:15,749",Get this thing out of me!
tt0133093,"00:42:17,477","00:42:18,910",Don't touch me!
tt0133093,"00:42:19,157","00:42:20,715",Stay away from me!
tt0133093,"00:42:21,117","00:42:22,550",I don't believe it.
tt0133093,"00:42:23,237","00:42:24,386",I don't believe it.
tt0133093,"00:42:24,637","00:42:25,592",I don't believe it.
tt0133093,"00:42:26,317","00:42:28,273","- He's gonna pop. - Breathe, Neo."
tt0133093,"00:42:28,837","00:42:29,667",Just breathe.
tt0133093,"00:42:47,317","00:42:49,035","I can't go back, can I?"
tt0133093,"00:42:49,957","00:42:50,867",No.
tt0133093,"00:42:51,997","00:42:53,146",But if you could...
tt0133093,"00:42:53,957","00:42:55,390",...would you really want to?
tt0133093,"00:42:57,797","00:42:59,150",I owe you an apology.
tt0133093,"00:42:59,677","00:43:00,996",We have a rule.
tt0133093,"00:43:01,437","00:43:04,668",We never free a mind once it's reached a certain age.
tt0133093,"00:43:04,917","00:43:05,747",It's dangerous.
tt0133093,"00:43:06,437","00:43:08,075",The mind has trouble letting go.
tt0133093,"00:43:08,317","00:43:10,512","I've seen it before, and I'm sorry."
tt0133093,"00:43:11,517","00:43:13,508",I did what I did because...
tt0133093,"00:43:14,197","00:43:15,596",...I had to.
tt0133093,"00:43:23,677","00:43:27,590","When the Matrix was first built, there was a man born inside..."
tt0133093,"00:43:28,077","00:43:31,706",...who had the ability to change whatever he wanted...
tt0133093,"00:43:32,077","00:43:34,875",...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.
tt0133093,"00:43:36,557","00:43:39,867",It was he who freed the first of us...
tt0133093,"00:43:40,717","00:43:42,275",...taught us the truth.
tt0133093,"00:43:43,677","00:43:46,635",As long as the Matrix exists...
tt0133093,"00:43:46,957","00:43:48,948",...the human race will never be free.
tt0133093,"00:43:52,997","00:43:54,476",After he died...
tt0133093,"00:43:55,197","00:43:57,791",...the Oracle prophesied his return...
tt0133093,"00:43:58,317","00:44:01,389",...and that his coming would hail the destruction of the Matrix...
tt0133093,"00:44:01,637","00:44:03,229",...end the war...
tt0133093,"00:44:03,557","00:44:04,706",...bring freedom to our people.
tt0133093,"00:44:06,037","00:44:10,474",That is why there are those of us who spent our lives searching the Matrix...
tt0133093,"00:44:10,797","00:44:12,310",...Iooking for him.
tt0133093,"00:44:14,637","00:44:16,628",I did what I did because...
tt0133093,"00:44:18,197","00:44:20,233",...I believe that search is over.
tt0133093,"00:44:25,117","00:44:26,470",Get some rest.
tt0133093,"00:44:27,077","00:44:28,795",You're going to need it.
tt0133093,"00:44:31,597","00:44:32,393",For what?
tt0133093,"00:44:35,517","00:44:36,472",Your training.
tt0133093,"00:44:54,037","00:44:55,675",Morning. Did you sleep?
tt0133093,"00:44:56,517","00:44:57,666",You will tonight.
tt0133093,"00:44:58,037","00:44:59,516",I guarantee it.
tt0133093,"00:45:00,957","00:45:02,788",I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.
tt0133093,"00:45:03,237","00:45:05,546",- You don't have any... - Holes? Nope.
tt0133093,"00:45:06,437","00:45:10,953","Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100% pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human."
tt0133093,"00:45:11,197","00:45:12,346",Born free right here...
tt0133093,"00:45:12,877","00:45:14,151",...in the real world.
tt0133093,"00:45:14,397","00:45:15,989",Genuine child of Zion.
tt0133093,"00:45:16,797","00:45:19,152",#NAME?
tt0133093,"00:45:19,397","00:45:20,750",...Zion's where the party would be.
tt0133093,"00:45:21,237","00:45:22,465",It's a city?
tt0133093,"00:45:22,717","00:45:25,754",The last human city. The only place we have left.
tt0133093,"00:45:27,277","00:45:28,471",Where is it?
tt0133093,"00:45:30,157","00:45:31,112",Deep underground...
tt0133093,"00:45:31,357","00:45:33,427","...near the Earth's core, where it's still warm."
tt0133093,"00:45:34,997","00:45:36,794","You live long enough, you might see it."
tt0133093,"00:45:38,957","00:45:43,587","Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited to see what you're capable of..."
tt0133093,"00:45:43,837","00:45:45,509",...if Morpheus is right and all.
tt0133093,"00:45:45,997","00:45:48,636","We're not supposed to talk about this, but..."
tt0133093,"00:45:48,877","00:45:50,230",...if you are...
tt0133093,"00:45:51,277","00:45:53,188",...it's a very exciting time.
tt0133093,"00:45:54,197","00:45:56,791",We got a lot to do. We gotta get to it.
tt0133093,"00:46:00,557","00:46:03,355",We're supposed to start with these programs first.
tt0133093,"00:46:04,317","00:46:07,627",That's major boring shit. Let's do something more fun.
tt0133093,"00:46:07,957","00:46:09,390",How about...
tt0133093,"00:46:10,877","00:46:12,549",...combat training?
tt0133093,"00:46:18,357","00:46:19,756","""Jujitsu""?"
tt0133093,"00:46:20,597","00:46:22,189",I'm going to learn jujitsu?
tt0133093,"00:46:33,077","00:46:34,226",Holy shit!
tt0133093,"00:46:34,477","00:46:36,707","""Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."""
tt0133093,"00:46:37,037","00:46:38,265",How about some more?
tt0133093,"00:46:38,517","00:46:39,745","Hell, yes."
tt0133093,"00:46:41,957","00:46:42,753","Hell, yeah."
tt0133093,"00:46:54,637","00:46:55,467",How is he?
tt0133093,"00:46:55,717","00:46:57,833",Ten hours straight. He's a machine.
tt0133093,"00:47:08,557","00:47:09,876",I know kung fu.
tt0133093,"00:47:11,677","00:47:12,473",Show me.
tt0133093,"00:47:14,157","00:47:15,829",This is a sparring program...
tt0133093,"00:47:16,077","00:47:18,750",...similar to the programmed reality of the Matrix.
tt0133093,"00:47:18,997","00:47:21,227",It has the same basic rules. Like gravity.
tt0133093,"00:47:21,477","00:47:24,787",These rules are no different than those of a computer system.
tt0133093,"00:47:25,317","00:47:26,750",Some of them can be bent.
tt0133093,"00:47:26,957","00:47:27,753",Others...
tt0133093,"00:47:27,997","00:47:29,316",...can be broken.
tt0133093,"00:47:29,957","00:47:30,867",Understand?
tt0133093,"00:47:32,117","00:47:32,947",Then hit me...
tt0133093,"00:47:33,477","00:47:34,546",...if you can.
tt0133093,"00:48:12,513","00:48:12,945",Good!
tt0133093,"00:48:13,673","00:48:14,788",Adaptation.
tt0133093,"00:48:15,073","00:48:16,222",Improvisation.
tt0133093,"00:48:16,513","00:48:17,787",But your weakness...
tt0133093,"00:48:18,033","00:48:19,352",...is not your technique.
tt0133093,"00:48:26,033","00:48:28,024",Morpheus is fighting Neo.
tt0133093,"00:49:37,353","00:49:38,468",How did I beat you?
tt0133093,"00:49:44,793","00:49:45,828",You're too fast.
tt0133093,"00:49:46,353","00:49:47,627",Do you believe that...
tt0133093,"00:49:47,993","00:49:50,382",...my being stronger or faster...
tt0133093,"00:49:50,633","00:49:54,148",...has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
tt0133093,"00:49:58,033","00:49:59,751",You think you're breathing air?
tt0133093,"00:50:12,713","00:50:13,862",Again!
tt0133093,"00:50:24,873","00:50:27,182","Jesus Christ, he's fast!"
tt0133093,"00:50:27,433","00:50:29,549",His neuro-kinetics are way above normal.
tt0133093,"00:50:34,793","00:50:36,192",What are you waiting for?
tt0133093,"00:50:36,433","00:50:38,310",You're faster than this.
tt0133093,"00:50:40,433","00:50:42,549",Don't think you are.
tt0133093,"00:50:42,793","00:50:44,385",Know you are.
tt0133093,"00:50:54,353","00:50:57,072","Come on! Stop trying to hit me, and hit me!"
tt0133093,"00:51:06,553","00:51:08,225",I don't believe it.
tt0133093,"00:51:09,713","00:51:11,749",I know what you're trying to do.
tt0133093,"00:51:13,353","00:51:15,423","I'm trying to free your mind, Neo."
tt0133093,"00:51:15,753","00:51:17,744",But I can only show you the door.
tt0133093,"00:51:18,313","00:51:20,144",You have to walk through it.
tt0133093,"00:51:22,353","00:51:24,389","Tank, load the jump program."
tt0133093,"00:51:35,513","00:51:38,107","You have to let it all go, Neo. Fear..."
tt0133093,"00:51:38,633","00:51:40,703",...doubt and disbelief.
tt0133093,"00:51:41,833","00:51:44,427",Free your mind.
tt0133093,"00:51:59,953","00:52:01,591",Okey-dokey.
tt0133093,"00:52:03,593","00:52:04,708",Free my mind.
tt0133093,"00:52:05,273","00:52:06,228",What if he makes it?
tt0133093,"00:52:06,473","00:52:09,067",- No one's ever made their first jump. - I know.
tt0133093,"00:52:10,353","00:52:12,708",- But what if he does? - He won't.
tt0133093,"00:52:13,513","00:52:14,309",Come on.
tt0133093,"00:52:14,553","00:52:15,668",All right.
tt0133093,"00:52:16,113","00:52:18,069",No problem. Free my mind.
tt0133093,"00:52:18,833","00:52:21,506",Free my mind. No problem. Right.
tt0133093,"00:52:40,113","00:52:41,705",What does that mean?
tt0133093,"00:52:42,073","00:52:43,825",It doesn't mean anything.
tt0133093,"00:52:44,393","00:52:46,861",Everybody falls the first time.
tt0133093,"00:52:47,313","00:52:48,541","Right, Trin?"
tt0133093,"00:53:08,393","00:53:10,907",- I thought it wasn't real. - Your mind makes it real.
tt0133093,"00:53:14,033","00:53:16,183",If you're killed in the Matrix...
tt0133093,"00:53:16,553","00:53:17,349",...you die here?
tt0133093,"00:53:17,953","00:53:20,308",The body cannot live without the mind.
tt0133093,"00:53:49,553","00:53:52,784",I don't remember you ever bringing me dinner.
tt0133093,"00:53:55,753","00:53:58,472","There is something about him, isn't there?"
tt0133093,"00:53:59,073","00:54:00,631",You're a believer now?
tt0133093,"00:54:01,593","00:54:02,742",I keep wondering...
tt0133093,"00:54:02,993","00:54:06,508","...if Morpheus is so sure, why not take him to see the Oracle?"
tt0133093,"00:54:07,393","00:54:10,191",Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
tt0133093,"00:54:19,593","00:54:21,072","The Matrix is a system, Neo."
tt0133093,"00:54:22,753","00:54:23,981",That system is our enemy.
tt0133093,"00:54:24,593","00:54:26,823","But when you're inside, what do you see?"
tt0133093,"00:54:27,073","00:54:30,702","Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters."
tt0133093,"00:54:31,153","00:54:33,621",The very minds of the people we are trying to save.
tt0133093,"00:54:33,873","00:54:36,706","But until we do, these people are a part of that system..."
tt0133093,"00:54:36,953","00:54:38,784",...and that makes them our enemy.
tt0133093,"00:54:39,153","00:54:40,108",You have to understand...
tt0133093,"00:54:40,353","00:54:43,550",...most of these people are not ready to be unplugged.
tt0133093,"00:54:43,793","00:54:45,306",And many of them are so inert...
tt0133093,"00:54:45,553","00:54:46,673",...so hopelessly dependent on the system...
tt0133093,"00:54:46,673","00:54:47,867",...so hopelessly dependent on the system...
tt0133093,"00:54:48,113","00:54:50,707",...that they will fight to protect it.
tt0133093,"00:54:52,153","00:54:55,748",Were you listening to me or looking at the woman in the red dress?
tt0133093,"00:54:56,713","00:54:57,589",Look again.
tt0133093,"00:54:58,793","00:54:59,828",Freeze it.
tt0133093,"00:55:06,193","00:55:07,751",This isn't the Matrix?
tt0133093,"00:55:09,473","00:55:13,148",It's another training program designed to teach you one thing:
tt0133093,"00:55:13,753","00:55:16,062","If you are not one of us, you are one of them."
tt0133093,"00:55:16,593","00:55:19,266",#NAME?
tt0133093,"00:55:19,993","00:55:24,111",They can move in and out of any software still hardwired to their system.
tt0133093,"00:55:24,473","00:55:27,704",That means that anyone we haven't unplugged...
tt0133093,"00:55:28,033","00:55:29,307",...is potentially an agent.
tt0133093,"00:55:30,233","00:55:31,985",Inside the Matrix...
tt0133093,"00:55:32,553","00:55:34,191",...they are everyone...
tt0133093,"00:55:34,513","00:55:36,151",...and they are no one.
tt0133093,"00:55:36,393","00:55:39,385",We have survived by hiding and running from them...
tt0133093,"00:55:39,633","00:55:41,191",...but they are the gatekeepers.
tt0133093,"00:55:41,433","00:55:44,266",They're guarding all the doors and holding all the keys.
tt0133093,"00:55:44,513","00:55:47,232","Sooner or later, someone will have to fight them."
tt0133093,"00:55:47,593","00:55:48,548",Someone?
tt0133093,"00:55:48,873","00:55:50,226","I won't lie to you, Neo."
tt0133093,"00:55:50,673","00:55:55,303",Every single man or woman who has fought an agent has died.
tt0133093,"00:55:55,553","00:55:57,828","But where they have failed, you will succeed."
tt0133093,"00:55:58,233","00:55:59,029",Why?
tt0133093,"00:55:59,273","00:56:01,468",I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.
tt0133093,"00:56:01,713","00:56:05,149",Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit nothing but air.
tt0133093,"00:56:05,393","00:56:09,830",Yet their strength and speed are still based in a world built on rules.
tt0133093,"00:56:10,073","00:56:11,142",Because of that...
tt0133093,"00:56:11,393","00:56:14,624",...they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
tt0133093,"00:56:18,753","00:56:20,550",What are you telling me?
tt0133093,"00:56:21,233","00:56:22,632",That I can dodge bullets?
tt0133093,"00:56:24,553","00:56:25,872","No, Neo."
tt0133093,"00:56:26,353","00:56:29,151",I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready...
tt0133093,"00:56:29,993","00:56:31,312",...you won't have to.
tt0133093,"00:56:35,633","00:56:36,429",<i>We got trouble.</i>
tt0133093,"00:56:54,553","00:56:55,872",Did Zion send the warning?
tt0133093,"00:56:56,113","00:56:56,909","No, another ship."
tt0133093,"00:57:00,033","00:57:01,261",Shit.
tt0133093,"00:57:01,513","00:57:03,185",Squiddy's sweeping in quick.
tt0133093,"00:57:03,473","00:57:04,269",Squiddy?
tt0133093,"00:57:04,473","00:57:07,545",A sentinel. A killing machine designed for one thing.
tt0133093,"00:57:07,793","00:57:08,942",Search and destroy.
tt0133093,"00:57:10,233","00:57:11,348",Set her down there.
tt0133093,"00:57:32,273","00:57:33,183","How are we doing, Tank?"
tt0133093,"00:57:41,553","00:57:42,668",Power off-line.
tt0133093,"00:57:43,153","00:57:45,064",EMP armed...
tt0133093,"00:57:45,553","00:57:47,032",...and ready.
tt0133093,"00:57:47,313","00:57:49,110",Electromagnetic pulse.
tt0133093,"00:57:49,353","00:57:52,106",Disables any electrical system in the blast radius.
tt0133093,"00:57:52,353","00:57:54,469",It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
tt0133093,"00:58:00,033","00:58:00,829",Where are we?
tt0133093,"00:58:01,073","00:58:03,029",Their old service and waste systems.
tt0133093,"00:58:04,513","00:58:05,309",Sewers.
tt0133093,"00:58:05,513","00:58:08,107",There used to be cities that spanned hundreds of miles.
tt0133093,"00:58:08,593","00:58:10,424",Now these sewers are all that's left.
tt0133093,"00:58:10,673","00:58:11,947",Quiet.
tt0133093,"00:58:54,012","00:58:56,082",You scared the bejesus out of me.
tt0133093,"00:58:57,132","00:58:58,963",- Sorry. - It's okay.
tt0133093,"00:59:01,772","00:59:02,568",Is that...?
tt0133093,"00:59:02,812","00:59:04,325",The Matrix?
tt0133093,"00:59:07,372","00:59:10,409",#NAME?
tt0133093,"00:59:10,652","00:59:13,610",The image translators work for the construct program.
tt0133093,"00:59:13,852","00:59:17,128",But there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.
tt0133093,"00:59:17,372","00:59:20,205",You get used to it. I don't even see the code.
tt0133093,"00:59:20,452","00:59:23,728","All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead."
tt0133093,"00:59:24,852","00:59:26,171",Do you...
tt0133093,"00:59:26,452","00:59:27,487",...want a drink?
tt0133093,"00:59:27,732","00:59:28,721",Sure.
tt0133093,"00:59:32,132","00:59:33,531",You know...
tt0133093,"00:59:34,412","00:59:35,891",...I know what you're thinking.
tt0133093,"00:59:36,132","00:59:38,168",Because right now I'm thinking the same thing.
tt0133093,"00:59:38,452","00:59:41,649","Actually, I've been thinking it ever since I got here."
tt0133093,"00:59:43,492","00:59:46,370","Why, oh, why didn't I take the blue pill?"
tt0133093,"00:59:58,252","01:00:00,083","Good shit, huh?"
tt0133093,"01:00:00,412","01:00:01,561",Dozer makes it.
tt0133093,"01:00:02,012","01:00:03,127",It's good for two things:
tt0133093,"01:00:03,372","01:00:06,330",Degreasing engines and killing brain cells.
tt0133093,"01:00:07,292","01:00:09,408",So can I ask you something?
tt0133093,"01:00:12,292","01:00:13,850",Did he tell you why he did it?
tt0133093,"01:00:16,372","01:00:18,124",Why you're here?
tt0133093,"01:00:21,652","01:00:23,324",Jesus!
tt0133093,"01:00:24,492","01:00:26,323",What a mind job.
tt0133093,"01:00:27,692","01:00:30,365",So you're here to save the world.
tt0133093,"01:00:31,812","01:00:33,803",What do you say to something like that?
tt0133093,"01:00:38,772","01:00:40,091",A little piece of advice.
tt0133093,"01:00:41,812","01:00:43,165",You see an agent...
tt0133093,"01:00:43,492","01:00:45,687",...you do what we do:
tt0133093,"01:00:46,012","01:00:47,491",Run.
tt0133093,"01:00:47,812","01:00:49,484",You run your ass off.
tt0133093,"01:00:56,452","01:00:58,090",Thanks for the drink.
tt0133093,"01:01:02,612","01:01:03,727",Sweet dreams.
tt0133093,"01:01:07,572","01:01:10,848","Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?"
tt0133093,"01:01:11,492","01:01:12,561",You know...
tt0133093,"01:01:13,932","01:01:16,287",...I know this steak doesn't exist.
tt0133093,"01:01:17,252","01:01:19,891",I know that when I put it in my mouth...
tt0133093,"01:01:20,132","01:01:23,090",...the Matrix is telling my brain that it is...
tt0133093,"01:01:23,372","01:01:24,441",...juicy...
tt0133093,"01:01:24,732","01:01:26,370",...and delicious.
tt0133093,"01:01:29,172","01:01:30,366",After nine years...
tt0133093,"01:01:31,372","01:01:32,851",...you know what I realize?
tt0133093,"01:01:40,372","01:01:41,521",Ignorance is bliss.
tt0133093,"01:01:46,372","01:01:48,124",Then we have a deal.
tt0133093,"01:01:50,532","01:01:52,363",I don't want to remember nothing.
tt0133093,"01:01:52,612","01:01:53,408",Nothing.
tt0133093,"01:01:53,932","01:01:55,047",You understand?
tt0133093,"01:01:58,932","01:02:00,650",And I want to be rich.
tt0133093,"01:02:01,932","01:02:04,526","You know, someone important."
tt0133093,"01:02:05,972","01:02:07,041",Like an actor.
tt0133093,"01:02:08,212","01:02:11,204","Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan."
tt0133093,"01:02:13,292","01:02:14,771",Okay.
tt0133093,"01:02:15,132","01:02:17,441",You get my body back in a power plant...
tt0133093,"01:02:17,812","01:02:19,484",...reinsert me into the Matrix...
tt0133093,"01:02:19,812","01:02:21,165",...I'll get you what you want.
tt0133093,"01:02:21,412","01:02:23,323",Access codes to the Zion mainframe.
tt0133093,"01:02:23,572","01:02:25,642","No. I told you, I don't know them."
tt0133093,"01:02:28,492","01:02:30,403",I can get you the man who does.
tt0133093,"01:02:31,132","01:02:32,850",Morpheus.
tt0133093,"01:02:42,532","01:02:45,842","Here you go, buddy. Breakfast of champions."
tt0133093,"01:02:47,132","01:02:49,805","Close your eyes, it feels like you're eating runny eggs."
tt0133093,"01:02:50,052","01:02:50,848",Or a bowl of snot.
tt0133093,"01:02:52,172","01:02:53,685",You know what it reminds me of?
tt0133093,"01:02:55,452","01:02:57,682",Tastee Wheat. Did you ever eat Tastee Wheat?
tt0133093,"01:02:58,292","01:02:59,930","No, but technically, neither did you."
tt0133093,"01:03:00,172","01:03:02,128",That's exactly my point. Exactly.
tt0133093,"01:03:02,372","01:03:03,691",Because you have to wonder...
tt0133093,"01:03:03,932","01:03:07,049",...how do the machines really know what Tastee Wheat tasted like?
tt0133093,"01:03:07,292","01:03:08,645",Maybe they got it wrong.
tt0133093,"01:03:08,892","01:03:11,964",Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat tasted like actually tasted like...
tt0133093,"01:03:12,252","01:03:14,163",...oatmeal or tuna fish.
tt0133093,"01:03:14,532","01:03:17,251","That makes you wonder. Take chicken, for example."
tt0133093,"01:03:17,492","01:03:19,403",Maybe they didn't know what to make it taste like...
tt0133093,"01:03:19,652","01:03:21,608",...which is why it tastes like everything.
tt0133093,"01:03:21,852","01:03:23,570",#NAME?
tt0133093,"01:03:25,132","01:03:26,531",It's a single-celled protein...
tt0133093,"01:03:26,772","01:03:29,684","...combined with synthetic aminos, vitamins and minerals."
tt0133093,"01:03:29,932","01:03:31,126",Everything the body needs.
tt0133093,"01:03:31,372","01:03:34,125",It doesn't have everything the body needs.
tt0133093,"01:03:36,772","01:03:39,730",I understand you've run through the agent training program.
tt0133093,"01:03:40,732","01:03:42,688","You know, I wrote that program."
tt0133093,"01:03:42,972","01:03:44,200",Here it comes.
tt0133093,"01:03:44,452","01:03:46,329",#NAME?
tt0133093,"01:03:46,692","01:03:49,604",The woman in the red dress. I designed her.
tt0133093,"01:03:49,932","01:03:52,571",She doesn't talk very much...
tt0133093,"01:03:52,812","01:03:56,600","...but if you'd like to meet her, I can arrange a more personal milieu."
tt0133093,"01:03:56,852","01:03:58,171",The digital pimp hard at work.
tt0133093,"01:03:58,412","01:04:00,562","Pay no attention to these hypocrites, Neo."
tt0133093,"01:04:01,812","01:04:03,564",To deny our own impulses...
tt0133093,"01:04:03,812","01:04:06,804",...is to deny the very thing that makes us human.
tt0133093,"01:04:08,652","01:04:09,971","Dozer, when you're done..."
tt0133093,"01:04:10,212","01:04:11,565",...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.
tt0133093,"01:04:12,252","01:04:13,526",We're going in.
tt0133093,"01:04:14,212","01:04:15,565",I'm taking Neo to see her.
tt0133093,"01:04:19,732","01:04:20,528",See who?
tt0133093,"01:04:21,492","01:04:22,686",The Oracle.
tt0133093,"01:04:27,972","01:04:29,451","Everyone, please observe..."
tt0133093,"01:04:29,772","01:04:32,366","...the ""fasten seat belt"" and ""no smoking"" signs are on."
tt0133093,"01:04:32,852","01:04:36,083",Sit back and enjoy your flight.
tt0133093,"01:04:59,612","01:05:00,408",We're in.
tt0133093,"01:05:15,492","01:05:16,561",We'll be back in an hour.
tt0133093,"01:05:30,772","01:05:32,125",Unbelievable...
tt0133093,"01:05:32,932","01:05:34,206",...isn't it?
tt0133093,"01:05:37,652","01:05:39,404",- God! - What?
tt0133093,"01:05:40,052","01:05:41,371",I used to eat there.
tt0133093,"01:05:43,532","01:05:45,090",Really good noodles.
tt0133093,"01:05:49,692","01:05:52,081",I have these memories from my life.
tt0133093,"01:05:54,452","01:05:56,044",None of them happened.
tt0133093,"01:05:57,052","01:05:57,928",What does that mean?
tt0133093,"01:05:58,172","01:06:00,288",That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
tt0133093,"01:06:01,172","01:06:02,321",But an oracle can?
tt0133093,"01:06:02,772","01:06:03,921",That's different.
tt0133093,"01:06:08,812","01:06:09,642",Did you go to her?
tt0133093,"01:06:11,132","01:06:12,247",Yes.
tt0133093,"01:06:12,732","01:06:14,051",What did she tell you?
tt0133093,"01:06:17,172","01:06:18,605",She told me...
tt0133093,"01:06:19,612","01:06:20,727",What?
tt0133093,"01:06:24,372","01:06:25,646",We're here.
tt0133093,"01:06:26,852","01:06:28,205",Come with me.
tt0133093,"01:06:47,372","01:06:49,932",So is this the same oracle that made...
tt0133093,"01:06:50,252","01:06:51,048",...the prophecy?
tt0133093,"01:06:51,292","01:06:55,444",Yes. She's very old. She's been with us since the beginning.
tt0133093,"01:06:55,892","01:06:56,688",The beginning?
tt0133093,"01:06:56,892","01:06:57,802",Of the Resistance.
tt0133093,"01:06:59,972","01:07:02,247",And she knows what? Everything?
tt0133093,"01:07:04,212","01:07:06,043",She would say she knows enough.
tt0133093,"01:07:07,132","01:07:08,850",And she's never wrong.
tt0133093,"01:07:10,972","01:07:14,009",Try not to think of it in terms of right and wrong.
tt0133093,"01:07:14,332","01:07:15,845","She is a guide, Neo."
tt0133093,"01:07:16,212","01:07:18,009",She can help you to find the path.
tt0133093,"01:07:18,772","01:07:19,682",She helped you?
tt0133093,"01:07:22,092","01:07:23,366",What did she tell you?
tt0133093,"01:07:25,732","01:07:27,848",That I would find the One.
tt0133093,"01:07:40,452","01:07:42,488",I told you I can only show you the door.
tt0133093,"01:07:43,172","01:07:45,163",You have to walk through it.
tt0133093,"01:07:48,812","01:07:49,847","Hello, Neo."
tt0133093,"01:07:50,092","01:07:51,684",You're right on time.
tt0133093,"01:07:59,292","01:08:02,921","Make yourself at home, Morpheus. Neo, come with me."
tt0133093,"01:08:08,372","01:08:09,885",These are the other Potentials.
tt0133093,"01:08:10,132","01:08:11,611",You can wait here.
tt0133093,"01:08:50,772","01:08:53,206",Do not try and bend the spoon.
tt0133093,"01:08:53,572","01:08:55,608",That's impossible.
tt0133093,"01:08:56,412","01:09:00,246","Instead, only try to realize the truth."
tt0133093,"01:09:00,772","01:09:02,091",What truth?
tt0133093,"01:09:02,332","01:09:03,924",There is no spoon.
tt0133093,"01:09:06,412","01:09:07,686",There is no spoon?
tt0133093,"01:09:07,932","01:09:12,244",Then you'll see that it is not the spoon that bends. It is only yourself.
tt0133093,"01:09:27,612","01:09:29,045",The Oracle will you see now.
tt0133093,"01:09:39,292","01:09:40,771",I know you're Neo.
tt0133093,"01:09:41,372","01:09:42,487",Be right with you.
tt0133093,"01:09:43,492","01:09:44,447",You're the Oracle?
tt0133093,"01:09:44,812","01:09:45,767",Bingo.
tt0133093,"01:09:48,372","01:09:51,125","Not quite what you were expecting, right?"
tt0133093,"01:09:52,132","01:09:54,202",Almost done.
tt0133093,"01:09:56,612","01:09:58,170","Smell good, don't they?"
tt0133093,"01:10:00,812","01:10:02,564",I'd ask you to sit down...
tt0133093,"01:10:02,812","01:10:05,087",...but you're not going to anyway.
tt0133093,"01:10:05,572","01:10:07,324",And don't worry about the vase.
tt0133093,"01:10:07,532","01:10:08,328",What vase?
tt0133093,"01:10:11,332","01:10:12,447",That vase.
tt0133093,"01:10:13,372","01:10:14,361",I'm sorry.
tt0133093,"01:10:14,612","01:10:16,409","I said, don't worry about it."
tt0133093,"01:10:17,532","01:10:19,409",I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
tt0133093,"01:10:20,012","01:10:21,161",How did you know?
tt0133093,"01:10:23,132","01:10:26,761",What's really going to bake your noodle later on is...
tt0133093,"01:10:27,092","01:10:29,925",...would you still have broken it if I hadn't said anything?
tt0133093,"01:10:34,532","01:10:36,363",You're cuter than I thought.
tt0133093,"01:10:39,292","01:10:41,442",I can see why she likes you.
tt0133093,"01:10:42,292","01:10:43,327",Who?
tt0133093,"01:10:43,572","01:10:45,324","Not too bright, though."
tt0133093,"01:10:48,492","01:10:51,450",You know why Morpheus brought you to see me.
tt0133093,"01:10:53,492","01:10:54,607",So...
tt0133093,"01:10:55,532","01:10:56,851",...what do you think?
tt0133093,"01:10:58,612","01:11:00,284",Do you think you are the One?
tt0133093,"01:11:02,172","01:11:03,161",I don't know.
tt0133093,"01:11:06,452","01:11:07,805",You know what that means?
tt0133093,"01:11:08,612","01:11:09,727",It's Latin.
tt0133093,"01:11:10,092","01:11:12,208","Means, ""Know thyself."""
tt0133093,"01:11:13,612","01:11:15,489",I'll let you in on a little secret.
tt0133093,"01:11:17,652","01:11:21,327",Being the One is just like being in love.
tt0133093,"01:11:22,012","01:11:24,765",No one can tell you you're in love. You just know it...
tt0133093,"01:11:25,012","01:11:26,081",...through and through.
tt0133093,"01:11:26,412","01:11:28,368",Balls to bones.
tt0133093,"01:11:30,812","01:11:31,608",Well...
tt0133093,"01:11:33,492","01:11:35,483",...I'd better have a look at you.
tt0133093,"01:11:36,772","01:11:38,205","Open your mouth. Say, ""Ah."""
tt0133093,"01:11:52,012","01:11:53,604",Okay...
tt0133093,"01:11:54,212","01:11:58,967","Now I'm supposed to say, ""Hmm, that's interesting, but..."""
tt0133093,"01:11:59,452","01:12:00,521",Then you say:
tt0133093,"01:12:01,372","01:12:02,327",But what?
tt0133093,"01:12:02,572","01:12:06,360",But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
tt0133093,"01:12:07,732","01:12:08,687",I'm not the One.
tt0133093,"01:12:08,932","01:12:10,570","Sorry, kid."
tt0133093,"01:12:12,132","01:12:14,043",You got the gift...
tt0133093,"01:12:15,012","01:12:17,128",...but it looks like you're waiting for something.
tt0133093,"01:12:21,812","01:12:22,608",What?
tt0133093,"01:12:22,812","01:12:25,610","Your next life, maybe. Who knows?"
tt0133093,"01:12:26,172","01:12:28,322",That's the way these things go.
tt0133093,"01:12:29,172","01:12:30,002",What's funny?
tt0133093,"01:12:30,372","01:12:31,646",Morpheus.
tt0133093,"01:12:34,972","01:12:36,610",He almost had me convinced.
tt0133093,"01:12:36,852","01:12:37,921",I know.
tt0133093,"01:12:39,412","01:12:41,448",Poor Morpheus.
tt0133093,"01:12:43,732","01:12:46,724","Without him, we're lost."
tt0133093,"01:12:48,212","01:12:50,282","What do you mean, ""without him""?"
tt0133093,"01:12:54,132","01:12:55,963",Are you sure you want to hear this?
tt0133093,"01:12:58,092","01:13:00,731","Morpheus believes in you, Neo."
tt0133093,"01:13:02,372","01:13:04,442","And no one, not you, not even me..."
tt0133093,"01:13:04,692","01:13:06,842",...can convince him otherwise.
tt0133093,"01:13:07,212","01:13:09,487",He believes it so blindly...
tt0133093,"01:13:09,772","01:13:13,924",...that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
tt0133093,"01:13:14,172","01:13:14,968",What?
tt0133093,"01:13:15,172","01:13:17,970",You're going to have to make a choice.
tt0133093,"01:13:18,572","01:13:22,008","In the one hand, you'll have Morpheus' life."
tt0133093,"01:13:22,492","01:13:25,245","And in the other hand, you'll have your own."
tt0133093,"01:13:26,612","01:13:28,807",One of you is going to die.
tt0133093,"01:13:30,812","01:13:33,963",Which one will be up to you.
tt0133093,"01:13:35,292","01:13:37,123","I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am."
tt0133093,"01:13:37,372","01:13:38,964",You have a good soul.
tt0133093,"01:13:40,012","01:13:42,606",And I hate giving good people bad news.
tt0133093,"01:13:45,612","01:13:47,011",Don't worry about it.
tt0133093,"01:13:47,252","01:13:49,561",As soon as you step outside that door...
tt0133093,"01:13:49,812","01:13:51,848",...you'll start feeling better.
tt0133093,"01:13:52,532","01:13:56,161",You'll remember you don't believe in any of this fate crap.
tt0133093,"01:13:56,972","01:13:59,611",You're in control of your own life.
tt0133093,"01:14:00,412","01:14:01,640",Remember?
tt0133093,"01:14:03,452","01:14:04,407",Here...
tt0133093,"01:14:06,212","01:14:07,691",...take a cookie.
tt0133093,"01:14:08,212","01:14:11,409","I promise, by the time you're done eating it..."
tt0133093,"01:14:12,332","01:14:14,607",...you'll feel right as rain.
tt0133093,"01:14:23,452","01:14:24,726",What was said...
tt0133093,"01:14:25,332","01:14:26,731",...was for you...
tt0133093,"01:14:27,252","01:14:29,004",...and for you alone.
tt0133093,"01:14:51,012","01:14:52,081",They're on the way.
tt0133093,"01:15:20,852","01:15:21,648",What is that?
tt0133093,"01:15:35,812","01:15:37,165","Oh, déjà vu."
tt0133093,"01:15:40,532","01:15:41,567",What did you just say?
tt0133093,"01:15:41,812","01:15:43,245",Nothing. Just déjà vu.
tt0133093,"01:15:43,492","01:15:45,050",#NAME?
tt0133093,"01:15:46,412","01:15:48,482",A black cat went past us...
tt0133093,"01:15:48,732","01:15:50,290",...then another just like it.
tt0133093,"01:15:50,532","01:15:52,011",Was it the same cat?
tt0133093,"01:15:53,132","01:15:54,087",I'm not sure.
tt0133093,"01:15:54,852","01:15:55,648","Switch, Apoc."
tt0133093,"01:15:59,932","01:16:00,728",What is it?
tt0133093,"01:16:00,972","01:16:05,204",A déjà vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix when they change something.
tt0133093,"01:16:08,452","01:16:09,248","Oh, my God."
tt0133093,"01:16:11,012","01:16:11,922",Let's go.
tt0133093,"01:16:16,972","01:16:18,644",They cut the hard line. It's a trap! Get out!
tt0133093,"01:16:24,332","01:16:25,128","Oh, no."
tt0133093,"01:17:03,764","01:17:06,119",That's what they changed. We're trapped.
tt0133093,"01:17:06,364","01:17:08,161",Be calm. Give me your phone.
tt0133093,"01:17:08,404","01:17:09,883",They'll be able to track it.
tt0133093,"01:17:10,124","01:17:11,477",We have no choice.
tt0133093,"01:17:12,844","01:17:13,993",Operator.
tt0133093,"01:17:14,324","01:17:17,043",<i>Find a structural drawing of this building. Find it fast.</i>
tt0133093,"01:17:24,564","01:17:27,032",<i>- Got it! - I need the main wet-wall.</i>
tt0133093,"01:17:30,164","01:17:30,960",Eighth floor.
tt0133093,"01:17:31,164","01:17:32,677",<i>They're on the eighth floor.</i>
tt0133093,"01:17:32,964","01:17:34,363","Switch, straight ahead."
tt0133093,"01:17:42,084","01:17:44,234",I hope the Oracle gave you some good news.
tt0133093,"01:17:52,084","01:17:53,517",<i>Now left. That's it.</i>
tt0133093,"01:17:53,804","01:17:54,793",Good.
tt0133093,"01:18:04,124","01:18:05,352",Where are they?
tt0133093,"01:19:03,324","01:19:04,439",They're in the walls.
tt0133093,"01:19:05,844","01:19:06,959",In the walls!
tt0133093,"01:19:27,484","01:19:28,280",It's an agent!
tt0133093,"01:19:37,684","01:19:38,639",You must get Neo out!
tt0133093,"01:19:38,964","01:19:40,716",He's all that matters!
tt0133093,"01:19:41,004","01:19:42,153","No, Morpheus! Don't!"
tt0133093,"01:19:42,404","01:19:43,200","Trinity, go!"
tt0133093,"01:19:44,044","01:19:45,363",Go!
tt0133093,"01:19:51,324","01:19:53,155",- We can't leave him! - We have to!
tt0133093,"01:20:17,404","01:20:18,200",Come on!
tt0133093,"01:20:23,321","01:20:25,039",The great Morpheus. We meet at last.
tt0133093,"01:20:27,120","01:20:28,189",And you are?
tt0133093,"01:20:28,440","01:20:30,112",A Smith.
tt0133093,"01:20:30,360","01:20:31,588",Agent Smith.
tt0133093,"01:20:32,160","01:20:34,116",You all look the same to me.
tt0133093,"01:21:27,477","01:21:28,705",Take him.
tt0133093,"01:21:41,397","01:21:43,149","<i>- Operator. - I need an exit, fast.</i>"
tt0133093,"01:21:45,157","01:21:47,955",There was an accident. Goddamn car accident.
tt0133093,"01:21:48,277","01:21:49,995","<i>All of a sudden, boom.</i>"
tt0133093,"01:21:50,237","01:21:51,556",Somebody up there still likes me.
tt0133093,"01:21:51,797","01:21:52,991",I got you.
tt0133093,"01:21:53,477","01:21:55,308",<i>Just get me out of here fast.</i>
tt0133093,"01:21:55,557","01:21:58,117","Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie. An old TV repair shop."
tt0133093,"01:21:58,357","01:21:59,346",Right.
tt0133093,"01:22:02,357","01:22:03,870","<i>- Operator. - Tank, it's me.</i>"
tt0133093,"01:22:04,117","01:22:05,232",Is Morpheus alive?
tt0133093,"01:22:05,597","01:22:06,825","Is Morpheus alive, Tank?"
tt0133093,"01:22:07,237","01:22:09,068",<i>Yes. They're moving him. I don 't know where.</i>
tt0133093,"01:22:09,277","01:22:11,472",He's alive. We need an exit.
tt0133093,"01:22:11,717","01:22:12,593",You're not far from Cypher.
tt0133093,"01:22:12,837","01:22:14,111",<i>- Cypher? - I know.</i>
tt0133093,"01:22:14,357","01:22:16,348",<i>- I sent him to Franklin and Erie. - Got it.</i>
tt0133093,"01:22:25,077","01:22:26,226",Got him.
tt0133093,"01:22:36,717","01:22:37,706",Where are they?
tt0133093,"01:22:37,957","01:22:39,151",Making the call.
tt0133093,"01:22:39,797","01:22:40,912",Good.
tt0133093,"01:22:53,917","01:22:54,713",You first.
tt0133093,"01:22:57,757","01:22:58,553",Shit!
tt0133093,"01:23:07,277","01:23:09,347",I don't know. It just went dead.
tt0133093,"01:23:35,077","01:23:36,226","<i>Hello, Trinity.</i>"
tt0133093,"01:23:36,637","01:23:37,911",Cypher? Where's Tank?
tt0133093,"01:23:43,277","01:23:44,266",You know...
tt0133093,"01:23:45,917","01:23:47,953",...for a long time...
tt0133093,"01:23:49,117","01:23:51,915",...I thought I was in love with you.
tt0133093,"01:23:52,637","01:23:54,593",<i>I used to dream about you.</i>
tt0133093,"01:23:55,637","01:23:58,231","You're a beautiful woman, Trinity."
tt0133093,"01:23:58,477","01:24:00,752",<i>Too bad things had to turn out this way.</i>
tt0133093,"01:24:01,477","01:24:02,273",You killed them.
tt0133093,"01:24:02,757","01:24:04,190",#NAME?
tt0133093,"01:24:04,437","01:24:05,790","I'm tired, Trinity."
tt0133093,"01:24:07,157","01:24:08,954",I'm tired of this war...
tt0133093,"01:24:09,237","01:24:11,956",...tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship...
tt0133093,"01:24:12,277","01:24:16,714","...of being cold, of eating the same goddamn goop every day."
tt0133093,"01:24:19,037","01:24:19,913",But most of all...
tt0133093,"01:24:20,477","01:24:23,708",<i>... I'm tired of that jackoff and all of his bullshit.</i>
tt0133093,"01:24:24,797","01:24:26,025","Surprise, asshole!"
tt0133093,"01:24:26,557","01:24:28,673",I bet you never saw this coming...
tt0133093,"01:24:28,917","01:24:29,906",...did you?
tt0133093,"01:24:32,117","01:24:34,392","God, I wish I could be there..."
tt0133093,"01:24:34,957","01:24:36,390",...when they break you.
tt0133093,"01:24:37,397","01:24:40,434",I wish I could walk in just when it happens...
tt0133093,"01:24:41,117","01:24:42,755",...so right then...
tt0133093,"01:24:42,997","01:24:44,271",...you'd know it was me.
tt0133093,"01:24:44,957","01:24:45,867",You gave them Morpheus.
tt0133093,"01:24:46,117","01:24:47,516","<i>He lied to us, Trinity.</i>"
tt0133093,"01:24:48,077","01:24:49,510",He tricked us!
tt0133093,"01:24:50,037","01:24:51,948",If you had told us the truth...
tt0133093,"01:24:52,197","01:24:54,950",...we would've told you to shove that red pill up your ass!
tt0133093,"01:24:55,197","01:24:57,233","That is not true, Cypher. He set us free."
tt0133093,"01:24:57,477","01:24:58,353","<i>""Free.""</i>"
tt0133093,"01:24:58,597","01:25:00,235",You call this free?
tt0133093,"01:25:02,557","01:25:04,946",All I do is what he tells me to do.
tt0133093,"01:25:06,477","01:25:09,275",If I had to choose between that and the Matrix...
tt0133093,"01:25:10,397","01:25:11,546",...I choose the Matrix.
tt0133093,"01:25:11,797","01:25:13,389",The Matrix isn't real.
tt0133093,"01:25:13,637","01:25:14,990","<i>I disagree, Trinity.</i>"
tt0133093,"01:25:15,237","01:25:17,387",I think the Matrix...
tt0133093,"01:25:17,717","01:25:20,185",...can be more real than this world.
tt0133093,"01:25:22,277","01:25:24,666",All I do is pull the plug here.
tt0133093,"01:25:25,237","01:25:26,192",But there...
tt0133093,"01:25:26,717","01:25:28,912",<i>... you have to watch Apoc die.</i>
tt0133093,"01:25:36,357","01:25:37,995",<i>Welcome to the real world.</i>
tt0133093,"01:25:38,317","01:25:39,193",But you're out.
tt0133093,"01:25:39,437","01:25:41,746",<i>- You can 't go back. - That's what you think.</i>
tt0133093,"01:25:41,997","01:25:43,430",<i>They'll reinsert my body.</i>
tt0133093,"01:25:43,677","01:25:47,147","<i>I go back to sleep. When I wake up, I won 't remember a thing.</i>"
tt0133093,"01:25:47,397","01:25:48,352",By the way...
tt0133093,"01:25:48,597","01:25:51,430",...if you have anything important to say to Switch...
tt0133093,"01:25:51,917","01:25:52,952",<i>... say it now.</i>
tt0133093,"01:25:53,197","01:25:54,027","No, please don't."
tt0133093,"01:25:54,557","01:25:56,115",Not like this.
tt0133093,"01:25:57,757","01:25:59,315",Not like this.
tt0133093,"01:26:03,597","01:26:04,586",Too late.
tt0133093,"01:26:04,957","01:26:06,549","Goddamn you, Cypher!"
tt0133093,"01:26:06,797","01:26:08,594","Don't hate me, Trinity."
tt0133093,"01:26:08,957","01:26:10,754",I'm just a messenger.
tt0133093,"01:26:11,157","01:26:14,194","And right now, I'm going to prove it to you."
tt0133093,"01:26:15,237","01:26:16,829",If Morpheus was right...
tt0133093,"01:26:17,357","01:26:19,154",...there's no way I can pull this plug.
tt0133093,"01:26:19,717","01:26:21,150",<i>If Neo 's the One...</i>
tt0133093,"01:26:21,637","01:26:23,389",<i>... then there'd have to be...</i>
tt0133093,"01:26:23,637","01:26:26,105",...some kind of a miracle to stop me.
tt0133093,"01:26:26,597","01:26:27,427",Right?
tt0133093,"01:26:28,037","01:26:30,107","I mean, how can he be the One..."
tt0133093,"01:26:30,397","01:26:31,227",...if he's dead?
tt0133093,"01:26:32,557","01:26:34,707",<i>You never did answer me before...</i>
tt0133093,"01:26:34,997","01:26:37,227",<i>... if you bought into Morpheus ' bullshit.</i>
tt0133093,"01:26:37,597","01:26:40,669",Come on. All I want is a little yes or no.
tt0133093,"01:26:41,997","01:26:44,227",Look into his eyes...
tt0133093,"01:26:44,957","01:26:46,390","<i>... those big, pretty eyes...</i>"
tt0133093,"01:26:49,037","01:26:50,311",...and tell me...
tt0133093,"01:26:50,997","01:26:52,225",<i>... yes...</i>
tt0133093,"01:26:52,517","01:26:53,836",<i>... or no.</i>
tt0133093,"01:26:55,077","01:26:56,146",Yes.
tt0133093,"01:26:56,957","01:26:57,833",I don't believe it.
tt0133093,"01:26:59,197","01:27:03,748","Believe it or not, you piece of shit, you're still going to burn!"
tt0133093,"01:27:21,677","01:27:22,587",You first.
tt0133093,"01:27:30,477","01:27:31,307",You're hurt.
tt0133093,"01:27:31,637","01:27:32,672",I'll be all right.
tt0133093,"01:27:35,357","01:27:36,472",Dozer?
tt0133093,"01:27:53,997","01:27:56,272",Have you ever stood and stared at it?
tt0133093,"01:27:57,117","01:28:00,109",Marveled at its beauty...
tt0133093,"01:28:00,477","01:28:02,627",...its genius?
tt0133093,"01:28:03,757","01:28:05,554",Billions of people...
tt0133093,"01:28:05,797","01:28:08,436",...just living out their lives.
tt0133093,"01:28:09,437","01:28:11,029",Oblivious.
tt0133093,"01:28:15,437","01:28:18,190",Did you know that the first Matrix...
tt0133093,"01:28:18,437","01:28:22,953",...was designed to be a perfect human world where none suffered...
tt0133093,"01:28:23,397","01:28:26,195",...where everyone would be happy.
tt0133093,"01:28:26,717","01:28:28,150",It was a disaster.
tt0133093,"01:28:28,397","01:28:32,549",No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost.
tt0133093,"01:28:33,397","01:28:35,069",Some believe that...
tt0133093,"01:28:35,317","01:28:39,515",...we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world.
tt0133093,"01:28:39,757","01:28:41,236",But I believe that...
tt0133093,"01:28:41,637","01:28:42,513",...as a species...
tt0133093,"01:28:42,757","01:28:46,432",...human beings define their reality through misery...
tt0133093,"01:28:46,677","01:28:47,996",...and suffering.
tt0133093,"01:28:48,237","01:28:50,831",So the perfect world was a dream...
tt0133093,"01:28:51,077","01:28:55,707",...that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from.
tt0133093,"01:28:56,997","01:29:00,512",Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this.
tt0133093,"01:29:00,957","01:29:02,390",The peak...
tt0133093,"01:29:02,637","01:29:03,990",...of your civilization.
tt0133093,"01:29:04,237","01:29:06,387","I say, ""your civilization""..."
tt0133093,"01:29:06,637","01:29:10,596","...because when we started thinking for you, it became our civilization..."
tt0133093,"01:29:10,837","01:29:13,795","...which is, of course, what this is all about."
tt0133093,"01:29:15,077","01:29:17,545","Evolution, Morpheus."
tt0133093,"01:29:17,837","01:29:19,111",Evolution.
tt0133093,"01:29:21,317","01:29:23,114",Like the dinosaur.
tt0133093,"01:29:25,197","01:29:26,755",Look out that window.
tt0133093,"01:29:27,437","01:29:29,473",You had your time.
tt0133093,"01:29:30,157","01:29:33,911","The future is our world, Morpheus."
tt0133093,"01:29:34,237","01:29:36,512",The future is our time.
tt0133093,"01:29:40,597","01:29:41,666",There could be a problem.
tt0133093,"01:29:42,597","01:29:45,828",- What are they doing to him? - They're breaking into his mind.
tt0133093,"01:29:46,077","01:29:48,147",It's like hacking a computer. All it takes is time.
tt0133093,"01:29:48,397","01:29:49,546",How much time?
tt0133093,"01:29:49,797","01:29:52,789","Depends on the mind. But eventually, it'll crack..."
tt0133093,"01:29:53,037","01:29:57,269",...and his alpha patterns will change from this to this.
tt0133093,"01:29:57,517","01:30:00,350","When it does, he'll tell them anything they want to know."
tt0133093,"01:30:00,597","01:30:01,586",What do they want?
tt0133093,"01:30:01,837","01:30:05,716",The leader of every ship is given codes to Zion's mainframe computer.
tt0133093,"01:30:05,957","01:30:08,755",If an agent got the codes and got into Zion's mainframe...
tt0133093,"01:30:08,997","01:30:11,955",...they could destroy us. We can't let that happen.
tt0133093,"01:30:12,757","01:30:14,270",Zion's more important than me...
tt0133093,"01:30:14,517","01:30:15,393",...or you...
tt0133093,"01:30:15,717","01:30:16,945",...or even Morpheus.
tt0133093,"01:30:20,597","01:30:22,189",There has to be something we can do.
tt0133093,"01:30:22,597","01:30:24,508",There is. We pull the plug.
tt0133093,"01:30:27,477","01:30:29,149",You're going to kill him?
tt0133093,"01:30:29,397","01:30:30,512",Kill Morpheus?
tt0133093,"01:30:31,117","01:30:32,675",We don't have a choice.
tt0133093,"01:30:39,197","01:30:41,995",Never send a human to do a machine's job.
tt0133093,"01:30:42,237","01:30:43,909",If the insider has failed...
tt0133093,"01:30:44,157","01:30:47,229","...they'll sever the connection as soon as possible, unless..."
tt0133093,"01:30:47,477","01:30:49,115",They're dead. In either case...
tt0133093,"01:30:49,357","01:30:52,747",We have no choice. Continue as planned. Deploy the sentinels.
tt0133093,"01:30:52,997","01:30:54,032",Immediately.
tt0133093,"01:30:59,077","01:31:01,637","Morpheus, you were more than a leader to us."
tt0133093,"01:31:02,557","01:31:04,673",You were a father.
tt0133093,"01:31:06,157","01:31:08,034",We'll miss you always.
tt0133093,"01:31:14,837","01:31:15,792",Stop!
tt0133093,"01:31:16,957","01:31:18,106",I don't believe this is happening.
tt0133093,"01:31:18,357","01:31:20,313",#NAME?
tt0133093,"01:31:21,077","01:31:22,396",I don't know.
tt0133093,"01:31:22,717","01:31:24,196",This can't be just coincidence.
tt0133093,"01:31:24,397","01:31:25,193",What?
tt0133093,"01:31:25,677","01:31:26,473",The Oracle.
tt0133093,"01:31:26,717","01:31:28,435",She told me this would happen.
tt0133093,"01:31:28,837","01:31:32,830",She told me that I would have to make a choice.
tt0133093,"01:31:33,277","01:31:34,471",What choice?
tt0133093,"01:31:37,317","01:31:38,147",What are you doing?
tt0133093,"01:31:38,557","01:31:39,706",I'm going in.
tt0133093,"01:31:40,037","01:31:41,231","No, you're not."
tt0133093,"01:31:41,477","01:31:42,273",I have to.
tt0133093,"01:31:42,477","01:31:45,947","Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself so that we could get you out."
tt0133093,"01:31:46,197","01:31:48,028",There is no way that you're going back in.
tt0133093,"01:31:48,597","01:31:51,714",Morpheus did what he did because he believed I'm something I'm not.
tt0133093,"01:31:54,837","01:31:56,395","I'm not the One, Trinity."
tt0133093,"01:31:56,757","01:31:59,590",#NAME?
tt0133093,"01:31:59,837","01:32:02,397","I'm sorry, I'm not. I'm just another guy."
tt0133093,"01:32:03,037","01:32:04,231","No, Neo, that's not true."
tt0133093,"01:32:04,797","01:32:06,071",It can't be true.
tt0133093,"01:32:06,397","01:32:07,307",Why?
tt0133093,"01:32:11,557","01:32:14,754",This is loco. They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.
tt0133093,"01:32:14,997","01:32:19,195","Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him. Three of them."
tt0133093,"01:32:20,437","01:32:24,191","I want Morpheus back too, but what you're talking about is suicide."
tt0133093,"01:32:24,437","01:32:25,995",That's what it looks like...
tt0133093,"01:32:26,237","01:32:27,113",...but it's not.
tt0133093,"01:32:27,357","01:32:29,632",I can't explain to you why it's not.
tt0133093,"01:32:30,677","01:32:34,226","Morpheus believed something, and he was ready to give his life for it."
tt0133093,"01:32:34,477","01:32:37,355",I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
tt0133093,"01:32:37,597","01:32:38,393",Why?
tt0133093,"01:32:38,637","01:32:40,036",Because I believe in something.
tt0133093,"01:32:40,237","01:32:41,033",What?
tt0133093,"01:32:42,437","01:32:44,075",I believe I can bring him back.
tt0133093,"01:33:00,357","01:33:02,188",#NAME?
tt0133093,"01:33:02,477","01:33:03,307","No, you're not."
tt0133093,"01:33:03,557","01:33:04,387","""No""?"
tt0133093,"01:33:05,517","01:33:07,553",Let me tell you what I believe.
tt0133093,"01:33:08,037","01:33:10,312",Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.
tt0133093,"01:33:10,637","01:33:14,755","I believe if you are serious about saving him, you will need my help."
tt0133093,"01:33:14,997","01:33:16,953",And since I am the ranking officer...
tt0133093,"01:33:17,197","01:33:19,950","...if you don't like it, I believe you can go to hell."
tt0133093,"01:33:20,677","01:33:22,986",Because you aren't going anywhere else.
tt0133093,"01:33:23,397","01:33:24,193",Tank...
tt0133093,"01:33:25,037","01:33:26,152",...Ioad us up.
tt0133093,"01:33:35,357","01:33:38,508",I'd like to share a revelation that I've had...
tt0133093,"01:33:38,917","01:33:40,396",...during my time here.
tt0133093,"01:33:40,637","01:33:44,471",It came to me when I tried to classify your species...
tt0133093,"01:33:44,717","01:33:46,867",...and I realized...
tt0133093,"01:33:47,117","01:33:49,312",...that you're not actually mammals.
tt0133093,"01:33:51,437","01:33:53,792",Every mammal on this planet...
tt0133093,"01:33:54,117","01:33:58,827",...instinctively develops an equilibrium with the surrounding environment.
tt0133093,"01:33:59,077","01:34:00,829",But you humans do not.
tt0133093,"01:34:01,357","01:34:04,747",You move to an area and you multiply...
tt0133093,"01:34:04,997","01:34:09,309",...and multiply until every natural resource is consumed.
tt0133093,"01:34:09,637","01:34:11,628",The only way you can survive...
tt0133093,"01:34:11,917","01:34:14,750",...is to spread to another area.
tt0133093,"01:34:19,957","01:34:22,710",There is another organism on this planet...
tt0133093,"01:34:22,957","01:34:24,834",...that follows the same pattern.
tt0133093,"01:34:25,437","01:34:27,029",Do you know what it is?
tt0133093,"01:34:27,397","01:34:29,149",A virus.
tt0133093,"01:34:30,437","01:34:33,349",Human beings are a disease.
tt0133093,"01:34:33,717","01:34:35,196",A cancer of this planet.
tt0133093,"01:34:35,437","01:34:37,473",You are a plague.
tt0133093,"01:34:37,997","01:34:38,952",And we...
tt0133093,"01:34:39,517","01:34:40,836",...are the cure.
tt0133093,"01:34:41,797","01:34:43,150","Okay, so what do you need?"
tt0133093,"01:34:43,757","01:34:44,826",Besides a miracle.
tt0133093,"01:34:45,397","01:34:46,546",Guns.
tt0133093,"01:34:47,557","01:34:48,512",Lots of guns.
tt0133093,"01:35:00,837","01:35:03,271",No one has ever done anything like this.
tt0133093,"01:35:04,437","01:35:06,268",That's why it's going to work.
tt0133093,"01:35:10,197","01:35:12,074",Why isn't the serum working?
tt0133093,"01:35:12,637","01:35:14,832",Perhaps we're asking the wrong questions.
tt0133093,"01:35:16,837","01:35:18,031",Leave me with him.
tt0133093,"01:35:20,517","01:35:21,586",Now.
tt0133093,"01:35:32,357","01:35:33,870","Hold on, Morpheus."
tt0133093,"01:35:34,117","01:35:36,711",They're coming for you. They're coming.
tt0133093,"01:35:38,997","01:35:41,033","Can you hear me, Morpheus?"
tt0133093,"01:35:41,277","01:35:43,837",I'm going to be honest...
tt0133093,"01:35:44,197","01:35:45,346",...with you.
tt0133093,"01:35:49,557","01:35:50,910",I...
tt0133093,"01:35:51,957","01:35:52,833",...hate...
tt0133093,"01:35:53,077","01:35:54,954",...this place...
tt0133093,"01:35:55,277","01:35:57,472",...this zoo...
tt0133093,"01:35:57,717","01:35:58,786",...this prison...
tt0133093,"01:35:59,037","01:36:02,074","...this reality, whatever you want to call it."
tt0133093,"01:36:02,317","01:36:04,512",I can't stand it any longer.
tt0133093,"01:36:05,237","01:36:07,034",It's the smell.
tt0133093,"01:36:08,357","01:36:10,154",If there is such a thing.
tt0133093,"01:36:10,477","01:36:13,628",I feel saturated by it.
tt0133093,"01:36:15,077","01:36:16,305",I can...
tt0133093,"01:36:16,557","01:36:17,387",...taste...
tt0133093,"01:36:18,197","01:36:20,153",...your stink.
tt0133093,"01:36:20,397","01:36:23,992","And every time I do, I fear that I have somehow been infected by it."
tt0133093,"01:36:24,237","01:36:25,033",It's repulsive.
tt0133093,"01:36:25,957","01:36:27,276",Isn't it?
tt0133093,"01:36:29,357","01:36:31,552",I must get out of here.
tt0133093,"01:36:31,957","01:36:34,073",I must get free.
tt0133093,"01:36:34,317","01:36:37,070",And in this mind is the key.
tt0133093,"01:36:37,317","01:36:38,909",My key.
tt0133093,"01:36:39,157","01:36:41,910","Once Zion is destroyed, there is no need for me to be here."
tt0133093,"01:36:42,157","01:36:43,715",Do you understand?
tt0133093,"01:36:43,997","01:36:45,316",I need the codes.
tt0133093,"01:36:45,557","01:36:47,787",I have to get inside Zion...
tt0133093,"01:36:48,117","01:36:50,506",...and you have to tell me how.
tt0133093,"01:36:50,917","01:36:52,714",You're going to tell me...
tt0133093,"01:36:52,957","01:36:55,027",...or you're going to die.
tt0133093,"01:37:14,397","01:37:16,074","Please remove any metallic items you're carrying. Keys, loose change."
tt0133093,"01:37:16,074","01:37:17,393","Please remove any metallic items you're carrying. Keys, loose change."
tt0133093,"01:37:21,153","01:37:22,142",Holy shit!
tt0133093,"01:37:33,750","01:37:34,580",Backup.
tt0133093,"01:37:34,830","01:37:36,343",Send backup.
tt0133093,"01:37:59,390","01:38:00,266",Freeze!
tt0133093,"01:40:09,790","01:40:10,745",What were you doing?
tt0133093,"01:40:12,510","01:40:13,738",He doesn't know.
tt0133093,"01:40:13,990","01:40:15,423",Know what?
tt0133093,"01:40:42,350","01:40:44,739",I think they're trying to save him.
tt0133093,"01:40:58,990","01:41:00,662",There is no spoon.
tt0133093,"01:41:29,070","01:41:31,140",Find them and destroy them!
tt0133093,"01:41:32,710","01:41:33,620",We're under attack!
tt0133093,"01:42:07,105","01:42:07,901",Help!
tt0133093,"01:42:29,025","01:42:30,174",Only human.
tt0133093,"01:42:31,225","01:42:32,135",Dodge this.
tt0133093,"01:42:44,825","01:42:46,304",#NAME?
tt0133093,"01:42:46,665","01:42:50,419",You moved like they do. I've never seen anyone move that fast.
tt0133093,"01:42:51,505","01:42:52,824",It wasn't fast enough.
tt0133093,"01:42:55,465","01:42:56,693",Can you fly that thing?
tt0133093,"01:42:57,985","01:42:58,781",Not yet.
tt0133093,"01:43:02,105","01:43:02,901",Operator.
tt0133093,"01:43:03,105","01:43:06,142",<i>I need a pilot program for a B-212 helicopter.</i>
tt0133093,"01:43:06,585","01:43:07,813",<i>Hurry.</i>
tt0133093,"01:43:15,425","01:43:16,983",Let's go.
tt0133093,"01:43:31,465","01:43:32,500",No.
tt0133093,"01:44:21,985","01:44:23,464","Morpheus, get up."
tt0133093,"01:44:23,705","01:44:24,501","Get up, get up."
tt0133093,"01:45:00,985","01:45:01,974",He's not going to make it.
tt0133093,"01:45:11,385","01:45:12,374",Got you.
tt0133093,"01:46:56,819","01:46:58,172",I knew it.
tt0133093,"01:46:58,979","01:46:59,934",He's the One.
tt0133093,"01:47:15,259","01:47:17,375","Do you believe it now, Trinity?"
tt0133093,"01:47:23,059","01:47:23,889",The Oracle.
tt0133093,"01:47:25,099","01:47:27,374",#NAME?
tt0133093,"01:47:27,739","01:47:29,252",...what you needed to hear.
tt0133093,"01:47:29,539","01:47:30,813",That's all.
tt0133093,"01:47:31,819","01:47:34,652","Sooner or later you'll realize, just as I did..."
tt0133093,"01:47:34,979","01:47:37,174",...there's a difference between knowing the path...
tt0133093,"01:47:37,899","01:47:39,127",...and walking the path.
tt0133093,"01:47:42,059","01:47:43,208",Operator.
tt0133093,"01:47:44,099","01:47:46,533",<i>- It's good to hear your voice. - We need an exit.</i>
tt0133093,"01:47:46,779","01:47:49,452","Got one ready. Subway station, State and Balboa."
tt0133093,"01:48:01,979","01:48:02,889",Damn it!
tt0133093,"01:48:03,139","01:48:04,288",The trace was completed.
tt0133093,"01:48:04,539","01:48:05,415",We have their position.
tt0133093,"01:48:05,819","01:48:07,969",Sentinels are standing by.
tt0133093,"01:48:09,619","01:48:11,052",Order the strike.
tt0133093,"01:48:17,339","01:48:18,408",They're not out yet.
tt0133093,"01:48:29,979","01:48:31,253","You first, Morpheus."
tt0133093,"01:48:51,099","01:48:53,294","Neo, I want to tell you something..."
tt0133093,"01:48:56,419","01:49:00,207",...but I'm afraid of what it could mean if I do.
tt0133093,"01:49:03,659","01:49:06,810",Everything the Oracle told me has come true.
tt0133093,"01:49:09,459","01:49:10,938",Everything but this.
tt0133093,"01:49:12,579","01:49:13,375",But what?

tt0133093,"01:49:40,419","01:49:41,215",Send me back.
tt0133093,"01:49:41,459","01:49:42,289",I can't.
tt0133093,"01:49:44,219","01:49:46,130",Mr. Anderson.
tt0133093,"01:49:48,219","01:49:49,538","Run, Neo. Run."
tt0133093,"01:49:54,619","01:49:56,177",What is he doing?
tt0133093,"01:49:56,419","01:49:57,613",He's beginning to believe.

tt0133093,"01:50:25,374","01:50:26,602",So are you.
tt0133093,"01:50:58,414","01:51:01,292",I'm going to enjoy watching you die...

tt0133093,"01:51:42,654","01:51:44,645","Jesus, he's killing him."
tt0133093,"01:53:07,294","01:53:09,330","You hear that, Mr. Anderson?"
tt0133093,"01:53:10,054","01:53:12,932",That is the sound of inevitability.
tt0133093,"01:53:15,414","01:53:18,611",It is the sound of your death.
tt0133093,"01:53:19,494","01:53:21,724","Goodbye, Mr. Anderson."
tt0133093,"01:53:21,974","01:53:23,532",My name...

tt0111161,"00:02:07,868","00:02:12,121",describe the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered.
tt0111161,"00:02:16,752","00:02:18,878",It was very bitter.
tt0111161,"00:02:18,962","00:02:23,382","She said she was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around..."
tt0111161,"00:02:24,802","00:02:28,346",And she said she wanted a divorce in Reno.
tt0111161,"00:02:28,430","00:02:30,264",What was your response?
tt0111161,"00:02:30,349","00:02:32,308",I told her I would not grant one.
tt0111161,"00:02:32,392","00:02:35,436","""I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."""
tt0111161,"00:02:35,521","00:02:39,190","Those were the words you used, Mr. Dufresne, according to your neighbors."
tt0111161,"00:02:40,317","00:02:43,986",If they say so. I really don't remember. I was upset.
tt0111161,"00:02:45,114","00:02:48,616",What happened after you argued with your wife?
tt0111161,"00:02:48,700","00:02:50,618",She packed a bag.
tt0111161,"00:02:51,703","00:02:54,872",She packed a bag to go and stay with... Mr. Quentin.
tt0111161,"00:02:54,957","00:02:57,250",Glenn Quentin.
tt0111161,"00:02:57,334","00:02:59,418",Golf pro at the Snowdon Hills Country Club.
tt0111161,"00:02:59,503","00:03:03,381",The man you discovered was your wife's lover.
tt0111161,"00:03:05,134","00:03:06,509",Did you follow her?
tt0111161,"00:03:07,761","00:03:09,929",I went to a few bars first.
tt0111161,"00:03:10,013","00:03:12,890","Later, I drove to his house to confront them."
tt0111161,"00:03:12,975","00:03:16,561","They weren't home, so I... parked in the turnout,"
tt0111161,"00:03:16,645","00:03:18,229",and waited.
tt0111161,"00:03:18,313","00:03:20,523",With what intention?
tt0111161,"00:03:20,607","00:03:22,400",I'm not sure.
tt0111161,"00:03:22,484","00:03:24,694",I was confused.
tt0111161,"00:03:24,778","00:03:26,445",Drunk.
tt0111161,"00:03:28,198","00:03:31,200","I think... mostly, I wanted to scare them."
tt0111161,"00:03:31,285","00:03:34,537","When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them."
tt0111161,"00:03:34,621","00:03:37,707",No. I was sobering up.
tt0111161,"00:03:37,791","00:03:40,543","I got back in the car, and I drove home to sleep it off."
tt0111161,"00:03:40,627","00:03:44,088","Along the way, I stopped, and I threw my gun into the Royal River."
tt0111161,"00:03:44,173","00:03:46,382",I feel I've been very clear on this point.
tt0111161,"00:03:46,466","00:03:50,261","Well, where I get hazy is where the cleaning woman shows up the following morning"
tt0111161,"00:03:50,345","00:03:56,017","and finds your wife in bed with her lover, riddled with .38 caliber bullets."
tt0111161,"00:03:57,060","00:04:01,314","Now, does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just me?"
tt0111161,"00:04:01,398","00:04:03,232","Yes, it does."
tt0111161,"00:04:03,317","00:04:09,405",Yet you still maintain that you threw your gun into the river before the murders took place?
tt0111161,"00:04:09,489","00:04:13,284",- That's very convenient. - It's the truth.
tt0111161,"00:04:13,368","00:04:18,080","The police dragged that river for three days, and nary a gun was found."
tt0111161,"00:04:18,165","00:04:20,958","So, there could be no comparison made between your gun"
tt0111161,"00:04:21,043","00:04:25,213",and the bullets taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims.
tt0111161,"00:04:26,506","00:04:29,383",And that also...
tt0111161,"00:04:29,468","00:04:31,469",is very convenient.
tt0111161,"00:04:31,553","00:04:33,054","Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?"
tt0111161,"00:04:34,264","00:04:36,515","Since I am innocent of this crime, sir,"
tt0111161,"00:04:36,600","00:04:40,186",I find it decidedly inconvenient that the gun was never found.
tt0111161,"00:04:41,355","00:04:43,439",<i>If I Didn't Care</i>

tt0111161,"00:05:21,103","00:05:23,354",<i>They had sinned.</i>
tt0111161,"00:05:24,982","00:05:28,985",<i>But was their crime so great as to merit a death sentence?</i>
tt0111161,"00:05:30,153","00:05:32,238","Now, while you think about that..."
tt0111161,"00:05:33,949","00:05:36,450",...think about this.
tt0111161,"00:05:36,535","00:05:39,078",A revolver holds six bullets.
tt0111161,"00:05:39,162","00:05:40,538",Not eight.
tt0111161,"00:05:40,622","00:05:44,083",I submit that this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion.
tt0111161,"00:05:44,167","00:05:47,211","That could be understood, if not condoned."
tt0111161,"00:05:47,296","00:05:49,922",No. This was revenge...
tt0111161,"00:05:50,007","00:05:54,510",of a much more brutal and cold-blooded nature. Consider this.
tt0111161,"00:05:54,594","00:05:57,138",<i>Four bullets per victim.</i>
tt0111161,"00:05:57,222","00:05:59,598","<i>Not six shots fired, but eight.</i>"
tt0111161,"00:05:59,683","00:06:03,602","<i>That means that he fired the gun empty,</i>"
tt0111161,"00:06:03,687","00:06:05,980",<i>and then stopped to reload...</i>
tt0111161,"00:06:07,065","00:06:09,650",<i>...so that he could shoot each of them again.</i>
tt0111161,"00:06:09,735","00:06:12,320",<i>An extra bullet per lover.</i>
tt0111161,"00:06:12,404","00:06:14,447",<i>Right in the head.</i>
tt0111161,"00:06:18,493","00:06:23,414","You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne."
tt0111161,"00:06:23,498","00:06:25,750",It chills my blood just to look at you.
tt0111161,"00:06:27,502","00:06:30,463","By the power vested in me by the state of Maine,"
tt0111161,"00:06:30,547","00:06:34,091","I hereby order you to serve two life sentences, back to back."
tt0111161,"00:06:35,177","00:06:37,803",One for each of your victims. So be it.

tt0111161,"00:23:14,926","00:23:16,510",What was his name?
tt0111161,"00:23:19,764","00:23:21,139",What did you say?
tt0111161,"00:23:23,017","00:23:25,394",I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.
tt0111161,"00:23:25,478","00:23:28,188","What the fuck do you care, new fish?"
tt0111161,"00:23:29,649","00:23:33,026",It doesn't fuckin' matter what his name was. He's dead.
tt0111161,"00:23:52,380","00:23:54,715",Hey...
tt0111161,"00:23:54,799","00:23:57,551",Anybody come at you yet?
tt0111161,"00:23:59,053","00:24:01,054",Anybody get to you yet?
tt0111161,"00:24:02,181","00:24:05,225","Hey, we all need friends in here."
tt0111161,"00:24:05,310","00:24:07,227",I could be a friend to you.
tt0111161,"00:24:09,689","00:24:11,356",Hey...
tt0111161,"00:24:16,195","00:24:18,071",Hard to get.
tt0111161,"00:24:19,741","00:24:21,408",I like that.
tt0111161,"00:24:28,041","00:24:31,335",<i>Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.</i>
tt0111161,"00:24:31,419","00:24:33,879","<i>I guess he had a lot on his mind,</i>"
tt0111161,"00:24:33,963","00:24:36,173",<i>trying to adapt to life on the inside.</i>
tt0111161,"00:24:37,717","00:24:40,427",<i>It wasn't until a month went by that he opened his mouth</i>
tt0111161,"00:24:40,511","00:24:42,804",<i>to say more than two words to somebody.</i>
tt0111161,"00:24:44,724","00:24:46,767",<i>As it turned out...</i>
tt0111161,"00:24:46,851","00:24:48,769",<i>that somebody was me.</i>
tt0111161,"00:24:52,357","00:24:56,526",<i>Officers Russell and Burwell report to the duty officer.</i>
tt0111161,"00:24:57,570","00:25:00,322",I'm Andy Dufresne.

tt0111161,"00:25:04,327","00:25:06,036",Why did you do it?
tt0111161,"00:25:06,120","00:25:07,746","I didn't, since you ask."
tt0111161,"00:25:07,830","00:25:10,874",You're gonna fit right in!
tt0111161,"00:25:10,959","00:25:14,127",Everybody in here's innocent. Didn't you know that?
tt0111161,"00:25:14,212","00:25:17,547","- Heywood, what are you in here for? - Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me."
tt0111161,"00:25:20,468","00:25:23,261",Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.
tt0111161,"00:25:23,346","00:25:27,099",You think your shit smells sweeter than most. Is that right?
tt0111161,"00:25:27,183","00:25:29,518","- What do you think? - To tell you the truth,"
tt0111161,"00:25:29,602","00:25:32,688",I haven't made up my mind.
tt0111161,"00:25:32,772","00:25:36,858",I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.
tt0111161,"00:25:36,943","00:25:40,445","I'm known to locate certain things, from time to time."

tt0111161,"00:25:43,616","00:25:44,992",A rock hammer.

tt0111161,"00:25:49,247","00:25:52,124","Well, if it was a toothbrush, I'd just quote a price,"
tt0111161,"00:25:52,208","00:25:54,793",but then a toothbrush is a non-lethal object.
tt0111161,"00:25:56,212","00:25:57,921",Fair enough.
tt0111161,"00:25:58,006","00:26:00,465",A rock hammer is about six or seven inches long.
tt0111161,"00:26:00,550","00:26:02,175",Looks like a miniature pickaxe.
tt0111161,"00:26:02,260","00:26:03,385",Pickaxe?

tt0111161,"00:26:12,395","00:26:14,771",And some mica.

tt0111161,"00:26:18,776","00:26:20,694",So?
tt0111161,"00:26:20,778","00:26:22,863","So, I'm a rock hound."
tt0111161,"00:26:22,947","00:26:26,158","At least, I was in my old life. I'd like to be again on a limited basis."
tt0111161,"00:26:26,242","00:26:28,368",Or maybe you want to hammer somebody's skull.
tt0111161,"00:26:28,453","00:26:29,911","No, sir."
tt0111161,"00:26:31,039","00:26:32,622",I have no enemies here.
tt0111161,"00:26:32,707","00:26:35,083",No? Wait a while.
tt0111161,"00:26:36,627","00:26:38,795",Word gets around.
tt0111161,"00:26:38,880","00:26:42,007",The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.
tt0111161,"00:26:42,091","00:26:43,884",Especially Bogs.
tt0111161,"00:26:44,969","00:26:49,181",I don't suppose it would help any if I explained to them I'm not homosexual.
tt0111161,"00:26:49,265","00:26:50,766",Neither are they.
tt0111161,"00:26:50,850","00:26:53,560",You have to be human first. They don't qualify.
tt0111161,"00:26:58,816","00:27:03,361",Bull queers take by force. It's all they want or understand.
tt0111161,"00:27:03,446","00:27:07,074","If I were you, I'd grow eyes in the back of my head."
tt0111161,"00:27:07,158","00:27:08,492",Thanks for the advice.
tt0111161,"00:27:08,576","00:27:10,160","Well, that's free."
tt0111161,"00:27:10,244","00:27:12,496",You understand my concern.
tt0111161,"00:27:12,580","00:27:15,123","Well, if there's any trouble, I won't use the hammer."
tt0111161,"00:27:15,208","00:27:19,419","Then I guess you want to escape. Tunnel under the wall, maybe."
tt0111161,"00:27:20,880","00:27:22,672",Did I miss something? What's funny?
tt0111161,"00:27:22,757","00:27:25,801",You'll understand when you see the rock hammer.
tt0111161,"00:27:27,678","00:27:29,679",What's an item like this usually go for?
tt0111161,"00:27:29,764","00:27:32,808",Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.
tt0111161,"00:27:32,892","00:27:35,579",My normal mark-up's 20 per cent.
tt0111161,"00:27:35,603","00:27:38,146",But this is a specialty item.
tt0111161,"00:27:38,231","00:27:40,793","The risk goes up, the price goes up."
tt0111161,"00:27:40,817","00:27:42,776",Let's make it an even ten bucks.
tt0111161,"00:27:42,860","00:27:44,736",Ten it is.
tt0111161,"00:27:45,822","00:27:48,240","Waste of money, if you ask me."
tt0111161,"00:27:48,324","00:27:49,866",Why's that?
tt0111161,"00:27:50,952","00:27:53,995",Folks around this joint love surprise inspections.
tt0111161,"00:27:55,581","00:27:57,874","If they find it, you're gonna lose it."
tt0111161,"00:27:57,959","00:28:00,085","If they do catch you with it, you don't know me."
tt0111161,"00:28:00,169","00:28:02,379","Mention my name, we never do business again."
tt0111161,"00:28:02,463","00:28:05,590","Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum. Now, you got that?"
tt0111161,"00:28:07,093","00:28:08,510",I understand.
tt0111161,"00:28:08,594","00:28:09,988",Thank you...
tt0111161,"00:28:10,012","00:28:11,638",Mr. er...?
tt0111161,"00:28:11,722","00:28:14,159",Red. The name's Red.
tt0111161,"00:28:14,183","00:28:15,225",Red?
tt0111161,"00:28:15,309","00:28:18,061",Why do they call you that?
tt0111161,"00:28:21,732","00:28:23,817",Maybe it's because I'm Irish.
tt0111161,"00:28:31,784","00:28:34,828",<i>I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby.</i>
tt0111161,"00:28:34,912","00:28:38,331",<i>He had a quiet way about him.</i>
tt0111161,"00:28:38,416","00:28:42,878",<i>A walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here.</i>
tt0111161,"00:28:42,962","00:28:44,504",<i>He strolled...</i>
tt0111161,"00:28:44,589","00:28:48,925","<i>like a man in a park, without a care or worry in the world.</i>"
tt0111161,"00:28:49,010","00:28:53,722",<i>Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place.</i>
tt0111161,"00:28:53,806","00:28:57,953",<i>Yeah. I think it would be fair to say...</i>
tt0111161,"00:28:57,977","00:29:00,061",<i>I liked Andy from the start.</i>
tt0111161,"00:29:01,814","00:29:05,025",Let's go! Some of us have got a schedule to keep.
tt0111161,"00:29:08,321","00:29:10,405",Move it! Come on. Move it!
tt0111161,"00:29:14,035","00:29:17,162","Bob, how are you doing? How's the wife treating you?"
tt0111161,"00:29:26,881","00:29:28,340",Easy.
tt0111161,"00:29:28,424","00:29:30,508",Keep it moving.
tt0111161,"00:29:33,304","00:29:34,554",Red...
tt0111161,"00:29:55,076","00:29:59,287",<i>Andy was right. I finally got the joke.</i>
tt0111161,"00:29:59,372","00:30:03,875",<i>It would take a man about 600 years to tunnel under the wall with one of these.</i>

tt0111161,"00:30:09,423","00:30:11,299",Not today.

tt0111161,"00:30:51,632","00:30:53,300",Thanks.
tt0111161,"00:30:57,138","00:31:00,348",Dufresne! We're running low on Hexlite.
tt0111161,"00:31:00,433","00:31:02,517",Get on back and fetch us up some.
tt0111161,"00:31:39,722","00:31:41,681","If you get this in your eyes, it blinds you."
tt0111161,"00:31:41,766","00:31:44,517",Honey... hush.
tt0111161,"00:31:56,572","00:31:58,990",That's it. You fight.
tt0111161,"00:31:59,075","00:32:00,658",It's better that way.
tt0111161,"00:32:09,085","00:32:11,920","<i>I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight,</i>"
tt0111161,"00:32:12,004","00:32:14,547",<i>and the Sisters let him be.</i>
tt0111161,"00:32:14,632","00:32:16,633",<i>I wish I could tell you that.</i>
tt0111161,"00:32:16,717","00:32:18,802",<i>But prison is no fairy-tale world.</i>
tt0111161,"00:32:20,763","00:32:22,889",<i>He never said who did it.</i>
tt0111161,"00:32:22,973","00:32:26,017",<i>But we all knew.</i>
tt0111161,"00:32:29,355","00:32:32,232",<i>Things went on like that for a while.</i>
tt0111161,"00:32:32,316","00:32:34,943",<i>Prison life consists of routine...</i>
tt0111161,"00:32:35,027","00:32:37,237",<i>and then more routine.</i>
tt0111161,"00:32:39,615","00:32:43,451","<i>Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises.</i>"
tt0111161,"00:32:44,620","00:32:46,663",<i>The Sisters kept at him.</i>
tt0111161,"00:32:46,747","00:32:50,095",<i>Sometimes he was able to fight 'em off. Sometimes not.</i>
tt0111161,"00:32:50,119","00:32:52,612",<i>And that's how it went for Andy.</i>
tt0111161,"00:32:52,696","00:32:55,240",<i>That was his routine.</i>
tt0111161,"00:32:55,324","00:32:59,118",<i>I do believe those first two years were the worst for him.</i>
tt0111161,"00:32:59,203","00:33:01,454","<i>And I also believe,</i>"

tt0111161,"00:36:35,294","00:36:38,337","Of course not, but you do need someone to set up the tax-free gift."

tt0111161,"00:55:36,594","00:55:40,138",Perhaps I could write to the State Senate and request funds from them.

tt0111161,"00:58:39,986","00:58:42,237","What the hell did you do to set him off, anyway?"
tt0111161,"00:58:42,321","00:58:44,656",Nothing. I come in here to say fare-thee-well.

tt0111161,"00:58:49,912","00:58:53,039",I just don't understand what happened in there. That's all.
tt0111161,"00:58:53,124","00:58:55,709",The old man's as crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse.
tt0111161,"00:58:55,793","00:58:58,003","Oh, Heywood, that's enough out of you."
tt0111161,"00:58:58,087","00:59:01,089",- I heard he had you shitting in your pants. - Fuck you!
tt0111161,"00:59:01,173","00:59:02,549",Would you knock it off?
tt0111161,"00:59:02,633","00:59:04,968",Brooks ain't no bug.
tt0111161,"00:59:05,052","00:59:06,928",He's just...
tt0111161,"00:59:08,806","00:59:10,640",He's just institutionalized.
tt0111161,"00:59:11,976","00:59:13,643","Institutionalized, my ass."
tt0111161,"00:59:13,728","00:59:18,023","The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood. 50 years."
tt0111161,"00:59:18,107","00:59:19,816",This is all he knows.
tt0111161,"00:59:19,900","00:59:22,319","In here, he's an important man."
tt0111161,"00:59:22,403","00:59:23,862",He's an educated man.
tt0111161,"00:59:23,946","00:59:26,031","Outside, he's nothing."
tt0111161,"00:59:28,200","00:59:30,827",Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.
tt0111161,"00:59:30,911","00:59:34,122",Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.
tt0111161,"00:59:34,206","00:59:36,291",You know what I'm trying to say?
tt0111161,"00:59:36,375","00:59:39,127","Red, I do believe you're talking out of your ass."

tt0111161,"00:59:43,299","00:59:45,842","But I'm telling you, these walls are funny."
tt0111161,"00:59:47,261","00:59:49,346",First you hate 'em...
tt0111161,"00:59:50,890","00:59:52,974",...then you get used to 'em.

tt0111161,"01:00:00,358","01:00:02,692",That's institutionalized.
tt0111161,"01:00:02,777","01:00:04,129",Shit.
tt0111161,"01:00:04,153","01:00:05,779",You can never get like that.
tt0111161,"01:00:05,863","01:00:07,781","Oh, yeah?"
tt0111161,"01:00:07,865","01:00:10,450",Say that when you've been here as long as Brooks has.
tt0111161,"01:00:10,534","01:00:12,410",Goddamn right.
tt0111161,"01:00:14,747","01:00:17,290",They send you here for life.
tt0111161,"01:00:17,375","01:00:19,459",That's exactly what they take.
tt0111161,"01:00:21,379","01:00:23,463","The part that counts, anyway."
tt0111161,"01:00:30,971","01:00:33,139","I can't take care of you no more, Jake."
tt0111161,"01:00:35,059","01:00:36,893","You go on, now."
tt0111161,"01:00:37,978","01:00:42,649",You're free.
tt0111161,"01:00:58,541","01:01:00,417",Bye.

tt0111161,"01:12:16,301","01:12:18,594",that they can't touch.
tt0111161,"01:12:18,678","01:12:20,554",It's yours.
tt0111161,"01:12:21,973","01:12:23,682",What are you talking about?

tt0111161,"01:12:32,901","01:12:34,860",Hope is a dangerous thing.
tt0111161,"01:12:36,446","01:12:38,489",Hope can drive a man insane.

tt0111161,"01:29:28,416","01:29:29,958",He's proud of you.

tt0111161,"01:29:50,312","01:29:52,772",He caught his wife in bed with some golf pro.
tt0111161,"01:29:52,857","01:29:54,941",He greased them both.
tt0111161,"01:30:02,825","01:30:04,701",What?
tt0111161,"01:30:04,785","01:30:07,162","About four years ago,"

tt0111161,"01:30:11,584","01:30:14,669",I stole a car. It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.
tt0111161,"01:30:15,963","01:30:18,006","About six months left to go,"
tt0111161,"01:30:18,090","01:30:20,133",I get a new cellmate in.

tt0111161,"01:30:23,137","01:30:24,698","Big, twitchy fucker."
tt0111161,"01:30:24,722","01:30:27,015",Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.
tt0111161,"01:30:27,099","01:30:29,142",You know what I'm saying?
tt0111161,"01:30:29,226","01:30:31,269","Six-to-twelve, armed burglary."
tt0111161,"01:30:31,353","01:30:34,564",He said he'd pulled hundreds of jobs.
tt0111161,"01:30:34,648","01:30:36,524","Hard to believe, high-strung as he was."
tt0111161,"01:30:36,609","01:30:39,611","You'd cut a loud fart, he'd jump three feet in the air."
tt0111161,"01:30:40,738","01:30:42,780","Talked all the time, too."
tt0111161,"01:30:42,865","01:30:45,200",That's the other thing. He never shut up.
tt0111161,"01:30:45,284","01:30:47,327","Places he'd been in,"
tt0111161,"01:30:47,411","01:30:50,079","jobs he'd pulled, women he'd fucked."
tt0111161,"01:30:50,164","01:30:52,582",Even people he'd killed.
tt0111161,"01:30:54,418","01:30:56,794",People who gave him shit.
tt0111161,"01:30:57,838","01:30:59,881",That's how he put it.
tt0111161,"01:30:59,965","01:31:01,508",So...
tt0111161,"01:31:01,592","01:31:03,676","one night, like a joke,"
tt0111161,"01:31:04,720","01:31:08,014","I say to him, I say, ""Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?"""
tt0111161,"01:31:08,098","01:31:09,891",So he says...
tt0111161,"01:31:09,975","01:31:13,603",I got me this job one time bussing tables at a country club.
tt0111161,"01:31:14,730","01:31:18,316",So I could case all these big rich pricks that come in.
tt0111161,"01:31:20,736","01:31:22,737","So I pick out this guy,"
tt0111161,"01:31:23,781","01:31:26,366",go in one night and do his place.
tt0111161,"01:31:28,536","01:31:30,537",He wakes up.
tt0111161,"01:31:30,621","01:31:32,664",He gives me shit.
tt0111161,"01:31:33,707","01:31:35,792",So I killed him.
tt0111161,"01:31:36,835","01:31:38,920",Him and this tasty bitch he was with.
tt0111161,"01:31:41,215","01:31:43,132",That's the best part.
tt0111161,"01:31:44,176","01:31:47,387","She's fucking this prick, see, this golf pro."
tt0111161,"01:31:47,471","01:31:49,556",But she's married to some other guy.
tt0111161,"01:31:50,599","01:31:52,684",Some hotshot banker.
tt0111161,"01:31:54,478","01:31:56,563",And he's the one they pinned it on.
tt0111161,"01:32:07,700","01:32:11,536",I have to say that's the most amazing story I ever heard.
tt0111161,"01:32:13,163","01:32:16,040",What amazes me most is you were taken in by it.
tt0111161,"01:32:16,125","01:32:17,750",Sir?
tt0111161,"01:32:17,835","01:32:19,502",Well...
tt0111161,"01:32:19,587","01:32:22,964",it's obvious this fella Williams is impressed with you.
tt0111161,"01:32:23,048","01:32:25,133",He hears your tale of woe
tt0111161,"01:32:25,217","01:32:28,136",and quite naturally wants to cheer you up.
tt0111161,"01:32:28,220","01:32:30,263","He's young, not terribly bright."
tt0111161,"01:32:30,347","01:32:34,225",Not surprising he wouldn't know what a state he'd put you in.
tt0111161,"01:32:34,310","01:32:36,436","Sir, he's telling the truth."
tt0111161,"01:32:36,520","01:32:40,565","Well, let's say, for the moment, this Blatch does exist."
tt0111161,"01:32:40,649","01:32:43,776","You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry,"
tt0111161,"01:32:43,861","01:32:46,070","""Yes, I did it! I confess!"
tt0111161,"01:32:46,155","01:32:48,364","And by the way, add a life term to my sentence""?"
tt0111161,"01:32:48,449","01:32:51,618","That doesn't matter. With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial."
tt0111161,"01:32:51,702","01:32:54,912",That's assuming Blatch is even still there.
tt0111161,"01:32:54,997","01:32:57,040",The chances are he'd be released by now.
tt0111161,"01:32:57,124","01:32:59,709","They'd have his last address, names of relatives."
tt0111161,"01:32:59,793","01:33:01,961","There's a chance, isn't there?"
tt0111161,"01:33:04,006","01:33:05,882",How can you be so obtuse?
tt0111161,"01:33:05,966","01:33:07,467",What?
tt0111161,"01:33:08,969","01:33:10,803",What did you call me?
tt0111161,"01:33:10,888","01:33:12,722",Obtuse. Is it deliberate?
tt0111161,"01:33:12,806","01:33:14,599","Son, you're forgetting yourself."
tt0111161,"01:33:14,683","01:33:17,518","The country club will have his old timecards,"

tt0111161,"01:33:19,813","01:33:23,816","- with his name on them. - If you indulge this fantasy, that's your business."
tt0111161,"01:33:23,901","01:33:27,862","- Don't make it mine. This meeting is over. - Sir, if I were to ever get out,"
tt0111161,"01:33:27,946","01:33:32,950",I would never mention what goes on in here. I'd be as indictable as you for laundering money.
tt0111161,"01:33:34,745","01:33:37,747","Don't ever mention money to me again, you sorry son of a bitch!"
tt0111161,"01:33:37,831","01:33:39,684",Not in this office.
tt0111161,"01:33:39,708","01:33:41,834",Not anywhere! Get in here now.
tt0111161,"01:33:41,919","01:33:45,171","I'm just trying to set your mind at ease, that's all. Sir, I..."
tt0111161,"01:33:45,255","01:33:46,631",Solitary. A month.
tt0111161,"01:33:46,715","01:33:48,883","- Yes, sir. - What's the matter with you?"
tt0111161,"01:33:48,967","01:33:52,197",- Get him out of here. - This is my chance to get out! Don't you see that?
tt0111161,"01:33:52,221","01:33:54,222",It's my life! Don't you understand?
tt0111161,"01:33:54,306","01:33:56,766",- Get him out! Get him out! - This is my life!
tt0111161,"01:33:56,850","01:33:58,101",No!
tt0111161,"01:33:58,185","01:34:00,019",A month in the hole.
tt0111161,"01:34:00,104","01:34:02,689",It's the longest damn stretch I ever heard of.
tt0111161,"01:34:02,773","01:34:04,565",It's all my fault.
tt0111161,"01:34:04,650","01:34:06,067","Oh, bullshit."
tt0111161,"01:34:06,151","01:34:09,445",You didn't pull the trigger and you certainly didn't convict him.
tt0111161,"01:34:09,530","01:34:11,906","Red, are you saying that Andy is innocent?"
tt0111161,"01:34:11,990","01:34:14,158","I mean, for real innocent?"
tt0111161,"01:34:14,243","01:34:16,285",It looks that way.
tt0111161,"01:34:16,370","01:34:18,413",Sweet Jesus.
tt0111161,"01:34:18,497","01:34:20,540",How long's he been here now?
tt0111161,"01:34:20,624","01:34:22,667",1947. What is that?
tt0111161,"01:34:22,751","01:34:24,293",- 19 years. - 19 years...
tt0111161,"01:34:24,378","01:34:27,004","<i>- Williams, Thomas.</i> - Yeah, over here."
tt0111161,"01:34:29,383","01:34:31,634",#NAME?
tt0111161,"01:34:32,845","01:34:35,763",What you got? Board of Education.
tt0111161,"01:34:35,848","01:34:38,516",#NAME?
tt0111161,"01:34:38,600","01:34:41,644",Are you gonna open it or stand there with your thumb up your butt?
tt0111161,"01:34:41,729","01:34:43,813",The thumb up my butt sounds better.
tt0111161,"01:34:44,857","01:34:47,608","Hey, Skeet, come on, give me that, you shithead."
tt0111161,"01:34:48,652","01:34:50,862","- Floyd, come on. - Over here, over here!"
tt0111161,"01:34:51,905","01:34:53,990","Hey, Red!"
tt0111161,"01:34:55,117","01:34:57,535","Come on, will you throw that away, please?"
tt0111161,"01:35:03,125","01:35:05,209","Well, shit."
tt0111161,"01:35:17,431","01:35:20,141",The kid passed. C+ average.
tt0111161,"01:35:20,225","01:35:22,310",Thought you'd like to know.
tt0111161,"01:35:38,869","01:35:40,953",The Warden wants to talk.
tt0111161,"01:35:54,343","01:35:55,468",Out here?
tt0111161,"01:35:55,552","01:35:57,637",That's what the man said.
tt0111161,"01:36:13,946","01:36:15,738",Warden?
tt0111161,"01:36:15,823","01:36:17,907",Tommy.
tt0111161,"01:36:23,372","01:36:24,831",Tommy...
tt0111161,"01:36:24,915","01:36:29,001",I'm asking you to keep this conversation just between us.
tt0111161,"01:36:30,420","01:36:32,505",I feel awkward enough as it is.
tt0111161,"01:36:50,983","01:36:53,067",We got a situation here.
tt0111161,"01:36:54,111","01:36:56,153",I think you can appreciate that.
tt0111161,"01:36:56,238","01:36:57,697","Yes, sir."
tt0111161,"01:36:57,781","01:36:59,282",I sure can.
tt0111161,"01:36:59,366","01:37:03,411","I tell you, son, this thing really came along and knocked my wind out."
tt0111161,"01:37:05,122","01:37:07,665","It's got me up nights, that's the truth."
tt0111161,"01:37:09,877","01:37:11,961",The right thing to do.
tt0111161,"01:37:13,297","01:37:16,299",Sometimes it's hard to know what that is.
tt0111161,"01:37:18,010","01:37:20,052",You understand?
tt0111161,"01:37:21,430","01:37:23,514","I need your help, son."
tt0111161,"01:37:24,933","01:37:26,995","If I'm going to move on this,"
tt0111161,"01:37:27,019","01:37:29,770",there can't be the least little shred of doubt.
tt0111161,"01:37:31,315","01:37:34,734",I have to know if what you told Dufresne was the truth.
tt0111161,"01:37:34,818","01:37:36,379","Yes, sir."
tt0111161,"01:37:36,403","01:37:38,029",Absolutely.
tt0111161,"01:37:38,113","01:37:41,198","Would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury,"
tt0111161,"01:37:41,283","01:37:43,678",having placed your hand on the Good Book
tt0111161,"01:37:43,702","01:37:46,412",and taken an oath before Almighty God himself?
tt0111161,"01:37:46,496","01:37:48,623",Just give me that chance.
tt0111161,"01:37:52,544","01:37:54,211",That's what I thought.
tt0111161,"01:38:41,301","01:38:43,386",I'm sure by now you've heard...
tt0111161,"01:38:44,638","01:38:46,013",A terrible thing.
tt0111161,"01:38:47,474","01:38:51,060","A man that young, less than a year to go, trying to escape."
tt0111161,"01:38:52,145","01:38:54,772",It broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.
tt0111161,"01:38:55,816","01:38:57,900","Truly, it did."
tt0111161,"01:38:59,945","01:39:02,029",We just have to put it behind us.
tt0111161,"01:39:04,199","01:39:05,616",Move on.
tt0111161,"01:39:07,077","01:39:08,953",I'm done.
tt0111161,"01:39:09,997","01:39:12,081",Everything stops.
tt0111161,"01:39:13,125","01:39:15,960",Get someone else to run your scams.
tt0111161,"01:39:17,295","01:39:19,380",Nothing stops.
tt0111161,"01:39:20,424","01:39:22,508",Nothing.
tt0111161,"01:39:24,261","01:39:26,345",Or you will do the hardest time there is.
tt0111161,"01:39:28,223","01:39:30,808",No more protection from the guards.
tt0111161,"01:39:30,892","01:39:33,227",I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton
tt0111161,"01:39:33,311","01:39:35,479",and cast you down with the Sodomites.
tt0111161,"01:39:37,232","01:39:39,734",You'll think you've been fucked by a train.
tt0111161,"01:39:41,028","01:39:43,070",And the library?
tt0111161,"01:39:43,155","01:39:44,280",Gone.
tt0111161,"01:39:44,364","01:39:46,741","Sealed off, brick by brick."
tt0111161,"01:39:47,784","01:39:50,578",We'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.
tt0111161,"01:39:50,662","01:39:52,705",They'll see the flames for miles.
tt0111161,"01:39:52,789","01:39:55,291",We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.
tt0111161,"01:39:56,877","01:39:58,794",You understand me?
tt0111161,"01:39:58,879","01:40:00,963",Catching my drift?
tt0111161,"01:40:04,051","01:40:06,135",Or am I being obtuse?
tt0111161,"01:40:17,272","01:40:19,398",Give him another month to think about it.
tt0111161,"01:41:06,988","01:41:10,032",My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.
tt0111161,"01:41:10,117","01:41:12,201",Like a closed book.
tt0111161,"01:41:13,411","01:41:16,163",Complained about it all the time.
tt0111161,"01:41:16,248","01:41:18,332",She was beautiful.
tt0111161,"01:41:20,544","01:41:22,628","God, I loved her."
tt0111161,"01:41:25,632","01:41:27,967","I just didn't know how to show it, that's all."
tt0111161,"01:41:30,470","01:41:32,555","I killed her, Red."
tt0111161,"01:41:34,015","01:41:36,100",I didn't pull the trigger.
tt0111161,"01:41:37,519","01:41:39,603",But I drove her away.
tt0111161,"01:41:40,814","01:41:43,357","That's why she died, because of me."
tt0111161,"01:41:43,441","01:41:45,526",The way I am.
tt0111161,"01:41:53,869","01:41:55,953",That don't make you a murderer.
tt0111161,"01:41:59,166","01:42:01,250","A bad husband, maybe."
tt0111161,"01:42:04,629","01:42:08,007","Feel bad about it if you want to, but you didn't pull the trigger."
tt0111161,"01:42:08,091","01:42:09,508","No, I didn't."
tt0111161,"01:42:09,593","01:42:11,635",Somebody else did.
tt0111161,"01:42:12,929","01:42:15,014",And I wound up in here.
tt0111161,"01:42:17,392","01:42:19,476","Bad luck, I guess."
tt0111161,"01:42:22,397","01:42:24,106",Yeah.
tt0111161,"01:42:24,191","01:42:26,483",It floats around.
tt0111161,"01:42:26,568","01:42:29,028",It's got to land on somebody.
tt0111161,"01:42:29,112","01:42:31,363","It was my turn, that's all."
tt0111161,"01:42:32,449","01:42:34,909",I was in the path of the tornado.
tt0111161,"01:42:41,499","01:42:45,252",I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has.
tt0111161,"01:42:49,341","01:42:51,258",Do you think you'll ever get out of here?
tt0111161,"01:42:52,510","01:42:54,178",Me?
tt0111161,"01:42:56,473","01:42:57,932",Yeah.
tt0111161,"01:42:58,975","01:43:00,935","One day, when I've got a long, white beard"
tt0111161,"01:43:01,019","01:43:04,521","and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs, they'll let me out."
tt0111161,"01:43:04,941","01:43:07,025",I tell you where I'd go.
tt0111161,"01:43:08,236","01:43:09,862",Zihuatanejo.
tt0111161,"01:43:09,946","01:43:11,864",Zi... what?
tt0111161,"01:43:11,948","01:43:13,991",Zihuatanejo.
tt0111161,"01:43:14,075","01:43:16,160",It's in Mexico.
tt0111161,"01:43:17,954","01:43:20,164",A little place on the Pacific Ocean.
tt0111161,"01:43:21,416","01:43:23,792",You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific?
tt0111161,"01:43:23,877","01:43:25,335",No.
tt0111161,"01:43:25,420","01:43:27,504",They say it has no memory.
tt0111161,"01:43:29,966","01:43:32,509",That's where I want to live the rest of my life.
tt0111161,"01:43:34,095","01:43:36,180",A warm place with no memory.
tt0111161,"01:43:39,476","01:43:41,769","Open up a little hotel,"
tt0111161,"01:43:43,605","01:43:45,481",right on the beach.
tt0111161,"01:43:45,565","01:43:47,608","Buy some worthless old boat,"
tt0111161,"01:43:47,692","01:43:49,777",fix it up new.
tt0111161,"01:43:52,739","01:43:53,947",Take my guests out.
tt0111161,"01:43:54,032","01:43:56,116",Charter fishing.
tt0111161,"01:44:00,038","01:44:02,664","Zihuatanejo, huh?"
tt0111161,"01:44:05,293","01:44:09,171","In a place like that, I could use a man who knows how to get things."
tt0111161,"01:44:15,595","01:44:18,305","I don't think I could make it on the outside, Andy."
tt0111161,"01:44:25,063","01:44:27,147",I've been in here most of my life.
tt0111161,"01:44:28,650","01:44:30,442",I'm an institutional man now.
tt0111161,"01:44:30,527","01:44:32,611",Just like Brooks was.
tt0111161,"01:44:34,030","01:44:36,281","Well, you underestimate yourself."
tt0111161,"01:44:36,366","01:44:38,450",I don't think so.
tt0111161,"01:44:41,079","01:44:45,290","I mean... in here, I'm the guy who can get things for you, sure."
tt0111161,"01:44:45,375","01:44:49,294","But outside, all you need is the Yellow Pages."
tt0111161,"01:44:49,379","01:44:51,797","Hell, I wouldn't even know where to begin."
tt0111161,"01:44:53,883","01:44:56,218",The Pacific Ocean?
tt0111161,"01:44:56,302","01:44:58,345",Shit.
tt0111161,"01:44:58,429","01:45:01,598",#NAME?
tt0111161,"01:45:01,683","01:45:05,143",I didn't shoot my wife and I didn't shoot her lover.
tt0111161,"01:45:07,063","01:45:10,691","Whatever mistakes I've made, I've paid for them and then some."
tt0111161,"01:45:10,775","01:45:12,943","That hotel, that boat."
tt0111161,"01:45:14,529","01:45:16,697",I don't think that's too much to ask.
tt0111161,"01:45:21,327","01:45:24,204","I don't think you ought to be doing this to yourself, Andy."
tt0111161,"01:45:24,289","01:45:26,331",These are just shitty pipe dreams.
tt0111161,"01:45:26,416","01:45:29,376","I mean, Mexico is way the hell down there and you're in here."
tt0111161,"01:45:29,460","01:45:31,503",And that's the way it is.
tt0111161,"01:45:31,588","01:45:34,214","Yeah, right. That's the way it is."
tt0111161,"01:45:35,967","01:45:38,051",It's down there and I'm in here.
tt0111161,"01:45:40,763","01:45:43,557","I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really."
tt0111161,"01:45:46,394","01:45:48,437",Get busy living
tt0111161,"01:45:48,521","01:45:51,440",or get busy dying.
tt0111161,"01:45:55,236","01:45:57,321",Andy.
tt0111161,"01:45:59,782","01:46:01,867",Red.
tt0111161,"01:46:02,911","01:46:05,329","If you ever get out of here, do me a favor."
tt0111161,"01:46:05,413","01:46:07,247","Sure, Andy."
tt0111161,"01:46:07,332","01:46:08,665",Anything.
tt0111161,"01:46:09,751","01:46:13,211",There's a big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is?
tt0111161,"01:46:15,214","01:46:19,009","- Well, just... There's a lot of hayfields up there. - One in particular."
tt0111161,"01:46:19,093","01:46:21,136",It's got a long rock wall
tt0111161,"01:46:21,220","01:46:23,138",with a big oak tree at the north end.
tt0111161,"01:46:23,222","01:46:25,933",It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.
tt0111161,"01:46:27,310","01:46:30,020",It's where I asked my wife to marry me.
tt0111161,"01:46:31,230","01:46:35,025",We went there for a picnic and made love under that oak.
tt0111161,"01:46:36,527","01:46:38,612",I asked and she said yes.

tt0993846,"00:42:00,295","00:42:01,355",It got so bad.
tt0993846,"00:42:01,925","00:42:03,910","I had to declare the office a fuck-free zone,"

tt0993846,"00:42:05,930","00:42:08,203",but i'm telling you even that didn’t help.
tt0993846,"00:42:08,410","00:42:11,050","Actually the madness started on our very first day,"
tt0993846,"00:42:11,520","00:42:13,435","when one of our brokers, Ben Jenner,"
tt0993846,"00:42:13,635","00:42:17,003",christened the elevator by getting a blowjob from a sales assistant.

tt0993846,"00:42:28,242","00:42:31,536",On a saturday afternoon while our wives were out shopping for Christmas dresses.
tt0993846,"00:42:32,010","00:42:33,850","Eventually Ben married her, which was.."
tt0993846,"00:42:34,370","00:42:38,134",pretty amazing considering she blew every single guy in the office.
tt0993846,"00:42:38,910","00:42:41,538",He then got depressed and killed himself three years later.
tt0993846,"00:42:41,738","00:42:45,189","Anyway, I hired my Dad Max to maintain order,"
tt0993846,"00:42:45,389","00:42:46,389",As the enforcer.
tt0993846,"00:42:46,510","00:42:48,530",Stratten's very own Gestapo.
tt0993846,"00:42:49,500","00:42:52,330","We called him Mad Max because of his hair-trigger temper,"
tt0993846,"00:42:53,070","00:42:56,520",which could be set off by something as innocuous as a ringing telephone.
tt0993846,"00:42:57,910","00:42:58,870",Who the fuck
tt0993846,"00:42:59,630","00:43:03,508",has the goddamn gall to call this house on a Tuesday night!

tt0993846,"00:43:32,290","00:43:33,290","Well, he discovered.."
tt0993846,"00:43:33,490","00:43:35,867",..it was his mother's sister. - Who is he? Who?
tt0993846,"00:43:36,067","00:43:38,506",The main guy. You know the main guy.
tt0993846,"00:43:38,706","00:43:41,538",It was his mother's sister. She showed up dead.
tt0993846,"00:43:41,682","00:43:46,602","<i>Of course, Mad Max didn't have to know everything we're doing at Straten.</i>"
tt0993846,"00:43:46,802","00:43:48,005","Then, there's a big target."
tt0993846,"00:43:49,254","00:43:51,610",They get launched and stick? - There's a bullseye..
tt0993846,"00:43:51,810","00:43:52,810",The bullseye is a dollar sign.
tt0993846,"00:43:53,010","00:43:55,008","Whoever, gets closer to the dollar sign get the most bucks."
tt0993846,"00:43:56,720","00:43:59,175","So, if he gets hurts, what happens?"
tt0993846,"00:44:00,170","00:44:01,400","I don't think, he's gonna get hurt."
tt0993846,"00:44:01,600","00:44:03,969","they’ve got, like, superhuman strength anyway."
tt0993846,"00:44:04,169","00:44:06,749",You can't look him right in the eyes.
tt0993846,"00:44:06,949","00:44:09,624",You can't look him in the eye? - That's a fact. It's on PBS.
tt0993846,"00:44:09,824","00:44:12,148",They get confused and their wires get crossed.
tt0993846,"00:44:12,348","00:44:13,348",You gotta look like at the chin.
tt0993846,"00:44:13,548","00:44:15,884",Looks like i'm look at you but i'm lookin' at your chin.

tt0993846,"00:44:23,188","00:44:25,148","But, there's a limit to what we can do with him?"
tt0993846,"00:44:25,790","00:44:27,330",We're allowed to throw shit at him. We're allowed to throw..

tt0993846,"00:44:28,730","00:44:31,571","But, for example, what i wouldn't do is maybe like.."
tt0993846,"00:44:31,771","00:44:32,771",tell him to pull his cock out..
tt0993846,"00:44:32,971","00:44:35,594",and like get some of the girls to fondle him or shit..

tt0993846,"00:48:12,560","00:48:13,620","Then came NASDAQs,"
tt0993846,"00:48:14,910","00:48:15,964","who were pretty, but not great,"
tt0993846,"00:48:16,164","00:48:17,984",They cost betweem two to three hundred bucks.
tt0993846,"00:48:18,630","00:48:21,009","Finally there were pink sheets, skanks."
tt0993846,"00:48:21,450","00:48:22,460","They cost about a hundred or less,"
tt0993846,"00:48:22,840","00:48:26,088","and if you didn't wear a condom, you'd get a penicillin shot the next day,"
tt0993846,"00:48:26,288","00:48:27,288",and pray your dick didn't fall off.
tt0993846,"00:48:28,020","00:48:29,330","Not that we didn’t fuck them, too."
tt0993846,"00:48:29,650","00:48:32,297","Believe me, we did."

tt0993846,"00:48:49,813","00:48:50,813",It just kinda fades away a little bit..
tt0993846,"00:48:51,013","00:48:53,194","Yeah, well..it's supposed to fade away."
tt0993846,"00:48:53,394","00:48:54,965",Supposed to? - That's marriage.

tt0993846,"00:50:48,150","00:50:49,540",It was our next big move.
tt0993846,"00:50:50,040","00:50:51,840",Finding companies to take public.

tt0993846,"00:51:06,050","00:51:08,000",In order to stimulate our free flowing ideas.

tt0993846,"00:52:02,147","00:52:04,877",or 'lude' as it is commonly referred to.
tt0993846,"00:52:05,077","00:52:08,965",Was first synthesized in 1951 by an Indian doctor.
tt0993846,"00:52:09,165","00:52:10,165",that’s not feathers..

tt0993846,"00:52:17,268","00:52:18,268",someone figured out..
tt0993846,"00:52:18,468","00:52:21,949","that if you resisted the urge to sleep for fifteen minutes,"
tt0993846,"00:52:22,149","00:52:24,602",you got a pretty kick-ass high from it.
tt0993846,"00:52:24,802","00:52:28,748","Didn’t take long  for people to start abusing ludes, ‘course,"
tt0993846,"00:52:29,030","00:52:31,440","and in 1982 the U.S. Government Schedule One’d them,"
tt0993846,"00:52:31,640","00:52:33,942",along with the rest of the world.
tt0993846,"00:52:34,390","00:52:37,430",Which meant there was only a finite amount of these things left.
tt0993846,"00:52:37,630","00:52:38,630","No shit,"

tt0993846,"01:30:54,489","01:30:56,487",I got nothing to hide.
tt0993846,"01:30:56,687","01:30:59,590","You know, The SEC’s a civil regulatory agency."
tt0993846,"01:30:59,790","01:31:00,790",We pursue criminal activity.
tt0993846,"01:31:00,990","01:31:01,990",Exactly.
tt0993846,"01:31:02,510","01:31:03,510",You go after real criminal. Which...
tt0993846,"01:31:04,934","01:31:07,910","makes me wonder, what the hell you're investigating me for?"
tt0993846,"01:31:08,110","01:31:09,110","I mean, honestly. What.."
tt0993846,"01:31:09,190","01:31:13,118","What is it that you think, that we did or do. I don't get it."
tt0993846,"01:31:13,318","01:31:14,318","Well,"
tt0993846,"01:31:14,518","01:31:17,185","Jordan, I can’t discuss ongoing investigations."
tt0993846,"01:31:17,385","01:31:18,385","No, i get that. I understand."
tt0993846,"01:31:18,585","01:31:19,585",With that said.
tt0993846,"01:31:21,031","01:31:22,925",This case got dumped on my desk.
tt0993846,"01:31:23,125","01:31:24,125","You know, by a higher up.."
tt0993846,"01:31:24,325","01:31:27,473","Who needs to make a show of looking into the new company,"
tt0993846,"01:31:27,673","01:31:29,950",on the block. The whole press and everything.
tt0993846,"01:31:30,150","01:31:32,550",I end up being the smuck who does the looking.
tt0993846,"01:31:32,750","01:31:33,750",Exactly.
tt0993846,"01:31:33,950","01:31:34,950","It's just..you know, it bothers me."
tt0993846,"01:31:35,610","01:31:36,780",We are the new guy.
tt0993846,"01:31:36,980","01:31:38,669","we're the one that's banging on Wall Streets door, man."
tt0993846,"01:31:38,869","01:31:41,309",You should see what's going on at the bigger firm.
tt0993846,"01:31:41,509","01:31:42,509",I know all the information.
tt0993846,"01:31:42,610","01:31:43,660",It's true.
tt0993846,"01:31:43,860","01:31:45,926","Goldman, Leyman Brothers, Merrill."
tt0993846,"01:31:46,126","01:31:49,273",collateralized debt obligations? This internet stock bullshit?
tt0993846,"01:31:49,473","01:31:50,473","I mean, it's a fucking travesty."
tt0993846,"01:31:50,673","01:31:53,506","I mean, I could take you step-by-step,"
tt0993846,"01:31:53,706","01:31:57,465","to what exactly is occuring. You know, all you have to do is ask."
tt0993846,"01:31:57,665","01:31:58,665",I'm available.
tt0993846,"01:31:59,655","01:32:01,006",That's exactly what I wanted to hear.
tt0993846,"01:32:01,206","01:32:03,654","I don't see why, a little sit down like this."
tt0993846,"01:32:04,856","01:32:06,393",Can't be profitable for the both of us.
tt0993846,"01:32:06,593","01:32:08,954","It should, right? It should be profitable for us."
tt0993846,"01:32:09,154","01:32:10,154",It should. - Look?
tt0993846,"01:32:10,354","01:32:12,495","I'm gonna give you my personal line,"
tt0993846,"01:32:12,695","01:32:15,593",five days a week you just call me. Feel free.
tt0993846,"01:32:15,793","01:32:17,956",I'll do that. - Great.
tt0993846,"01:32:20,942","01:32:22,148",Are you sure you guys don't want something to drink?
tt0993846,"01:32:22,348","01:32:24,036","I mean, you're not hungry. Nothing?"
tt0993846,"01:32:24,236","01:32:26,098","Oh, no. - No?"
tt0993846,"01:32:29,137","01:32:30,064",Let me ask you.
tt0993846,"01:32:30,264","01:32:33,149","And if you don't wanna get too personal, just tell me to shut up at anytime."
tt0993846,"01:32:34,544","01:32:36,991",Did you try to get your broker's license at one time?
tt0993846,"01:32:37,191","01:32:38,191",Did I hear that right?
tt0993846,"01:32:38,391","01:32:40,330",Were you trying to take a stab at Wall Street?
tt0993846,"01:32:41,578","01:32:42,888",Who've you been talking to?
tt0993846,"01:32:43,088","01:32:45,276","Who the fuck have you been talking to? - Well, you're investigating me.."
tt0993846,"01:32:45,476","01:32:47,867",I hear things. You see what I mean?
tt0993846,"01:32:49,080","01:32:50,890","You ever think about, what would've happened."
tt0993846,"01:32:51,090","01:32:53,077","if you've..you know, stayed the course?"
tt0993846,"01:32:54,626","01:32:56,593","You know what. When I’m riding home on the subway,"
tt0993846,"01:32:56,793","01:33:00,031","And, my balls are fucking sweating. I'm wearing the same suit, three days in row."
tt0993846,"01:33:00,231","01:33:01,231","Yeah, you bet I do."
tt0993846,"01:33:01,431","01:33:03,144","I thought about it, before. Who wouldn't, right?"
tt0993846,"01:33:03,344","01:33:04,344","Right, who fucking wouldn't."
tt0993846,"01:33:04,544","01:33:06,467","I mean, you got.. another personal question."
tt0993846,"01:33:06,667","01:33:08,479","You don't need to answe.. - No, it's alright Jordan."
tt0993846,"01:33:08,679","01:33:11,521","What are you pulling? 50-60K something like that, a year?"
tt0993846,"01:33:15,596","01:33:16,556",Let's put it this way.
tt0993846,"01:33:16,756","01:33:19,425","You get a free handgun, when you sign up for the bureau."
tt0993846,"01:33:20,490","01:33:21,680","No. But, it fucking pisses me off."
tt0993846,"01:33:21,880","01:33:22,880","You know what I mean. You think about,"
tt0993846,"01:33:23,080","01:33:26,524","the people that build this country, hardworking people like you."
tt0993846,"01:33:26,724","01:33:29,064","You know,firefighters, teachers, FBI agents."
tt0993846,"01:33:29,264","01:33:32,889","End of the day, you guys get fucking skinned to life, financially."
tt0993846,"01:33:33,089","01:33:34,089",Fucking makes me angry.
tt0993846,"01:33:35,348","01:33:37,700",That's the one thing about Wall Street and this market is.
tt0993846,"01:33:37,900","01:33:43,010","For me, I feel, it's good to give back. You know, there's"
tt0993846,"01:33:43,210","01:33:45,299",there's situations.. where I can.
tt0993846,"01:33:45,499","01:33:48,366",make those situations better for people.
tt0993846,"01:33:48,566","01:33:49,566",You know.
tt0993846,"01:33:50,954","01:33:53,273","Opportunity, is everything."
tt0993846,"01:33:53,473","01:33:54,473",Exactly.
tt0993846,"01:33:54,673","01:33:57,073","Yeah, for example. I got this one kid, right."
tt0993846,"01:33:58,551","01:34:01,268",Went to school for environmental science or something like that.
tt0993846,"01:34:01,468","01:34:03,268",He was bogged down by student's loans.
tt0993846,"01:34:03,468","01:34:05,946","Turns out, his mother needed triple bypass surgery."
tt0993846,"01:34:06,146","01:34:07,146",Horrible situation.
tt0993846,"01:34:07,346","01:34:10,350","But, we got him in at the market at the right time."
tt0993846,"01:34:10,550","01:34:11,550",Choose the right stock.
tt0993846,"01:34:11,570","01:34:12,610",We gave him the right guidance.
tt0993846,"01:34:12,810","01:34:16,073","Boom. Overnight, changes his entire life."
tt0993846,"01:34:16,273","01:34:19,770","You know, he got to put his mother in the best hospital in New York city."
tt0993846,"01:34:19,970","01:34:23,197","It didn't work out for her, granted she passed away, unfortunately."
tt0993846,"01:34:23,397","01:34:26,138","But, we gave him that opportunity, you know what i'm saying."
tt0993846,"01:34:26,338","01:34:29,088","It's just about setting up the right team and then,"
tt0993846,"01:34:29,288","01:34:31,832","overnight, your life can change."
tt0993846,"01:34:37,208","01:34:38,947",What is..intern..uh..
tt0993846,"01:34:40,989","01:34:43,205",What does an intern make off on a deal like that?
tt0993846,"01:34:43,405","01:34:44,405",On that situation..
tt0993846,"01:34:44,605","01:34:48,146",On that particular trade. One trade.
tt0993846,"01:34:48,346","01:34:51,428",North of half a million dollars.
tt0993846,"01:34:55,599","01:34:57,373","And, I'd do that for anybody."
tt0993846,"01:34:57,573","01:35:00,910","You know, anybody that needs the proper guidence."
tt0993846,"01:35:20,410","01:35:22,482",Can you say that again?
tt0993846,"01:35:22,682","01:35:24,358","Just the way, you said it."
tt0993846,"01:35:24,558","01:35:25,558",Just the same way.
tt0993846,"01:35:30,892","01:35:31,755",I don't know what you're talking about.
tt0993846,"01:35:31,955","01:35:33,545",No..come on you know what i'm talking about.
tt0993846,"01:35:33,745","01:35:35,584","Just say the same thing. I think, what Jordan just did is he.."
tt0993846,"01:35:35,784","01:35:36,784",If I'm not mistaken.
tt0993846,"01:35:36,984","01:35:39,544",You just tried to bribe a Federal Officer.
tt0993846,"01:35:39,744","01:35:41,801","No, technically, I didn't bribe anybody."
tt0993846,"01:35:43,507","01:35:45,665","According to the US Criminal Code,"
tt0993846,"01:35:45,865","01:35:49,036",there needs to be exact dollar figure for the exchange of services.
tt0993846,"01:35:49,510","01:35:51,214",That would not hold up in the court of law.
tt0993846,"01:35:53,974","01:35:54,824","That's the truth, But.."
tt0993846,"01:35:55,024","01:35:56,519","I wanna tell you this, - Yeah."
tt0993846,"01:35:56,719","01:36:00,027","The same gentleman, that told me you tried to get your broker's license,"
tt0993846,"01:36:00,227","01:36:02,010",also told me that you are a straight arrow.
tt0993846,"01:36:02,210","01:36:03,210",He ran a security check on me.
tt0993846,"01:36:03,410","01:36:04,410",Well..
tt0993846,"01:36:06,414","01:36:09,945","i'm on a boat fit for a bond villain sometimes you need to play the part, right?"
tt0993846,"01:36:11,470","01:36:14,575",I think it's time you both get the fuck off my boat. What do you say?
tt0993846,"01:36:16,392","01:36:17,529","You know, Jordan. I'll tell you something."
tt0993846,"01:36:17,729","01:36:20,117","Most of the Wall Street jackasses I bust,"
tt0993846,"01:36:22,332","01:36:23,411",they were born to the life. - Is that right?
tt0993846,"01:36:24,864","01:36:26,157",Their father was a douchebags.
tt0993846,"01:36:26,357","01:36:28,302",Just like their fathers before them.
tt0993846,"01:36:28,502","01:36:29,502","But you,"
tt0993846,"01:36:31,719","01:36:34,764","You Jordan, you got this way all on your own."
tt0993846,"01:36:34,964","01:36:35,964",Did I?
tt0993846,"01:36:36,164","01:36:37,164","Good for you, little man."
tt0993846,"01:36:37,364","01:36:38,364",Little man?
tt0993846,"01:36:38,564","01:36:40,745","Good for you. - Me, the littleman?"
tt0993846,"01:36:40,945","01:36:41,945",Let me tell you something.
tt0993846,"01:36:42,145","01:36:43,925",Let me tell you something else.
tt0993846,"01:36:44,125","01:36:46,219","Honestly, i'm not bullshitting here,"
tt0993846,"01:36:46,419","01:36:48,234",this is one of the nicest boat that i've ever been on.
tt0993846,"01:36:48,434","01:36:49,842",I gotta..I gotta tell you. - I bet it is.
tt0993846,"01:36:50,042","01:36:51,042","And, you know what I was just thinking too."
tt0993846,"01:36:51,242","01:36:53,831",The fucking hero that I'm gonna be back at the office.
tt0993846,"01:36:54,510","01:36:56,934",When the bureau seizes this fucking boat.
tt0993846,"01:36:57,134","01:36:59,153","B'cos, I'm gonna finally fuck Jordan."
tt0993846,"01:37:00,987","01:37:02,009",It's beautiful.
tt0993846,"01:37:02,209","01:37:03,209","And, you get the beautiful girls and everything."
tt0993846,"01:37:03,480","01:37:04,727",It's wonderful.
tt0993846,"01:37:04,927","01:37:07,064","Alright, get the fuck off my boat."
tt0993846,"01:37:07,264","01:37:09,882","I'm sure we'll be seeing each other, real soon. - I'm sure."
tt0993846,"01:37:10,082","01:37:13,559",Good luck on that subway ride home to your miserable ugly fucking wives.
tt0993846,"01:37:13,759","01:37:16,879",I'm gonna have Heidi lick some caviar off my balls.In the meantime.
tt0993846,"01:37:17,079","01:37:19,732","Hey, you guys wanna take some lobsters for your ride home?"
tt0993846,"01:37:20,125","01:37:21,880",You fucking miserable pricks! I know you can't afford them.
tt0993846,"01:37:22,080","01:37:24,065",Fucking cheap fucks.
tt0993846,"01:37:24,265","01:37:25,265",Fucking miserable pricks!
tt0993846,"01:37:27,140","01:37:29,639","Hey, fellas..look what I found in my pockets. Look!"
tt0993846,"01:37:29,640","01:37:31,953","Your year salary, right here."
tt0993846,"01:37:32,153","01:37:33,153",You know what I call them?
tt0993846,"01:37:33,353","01:37:34,353",Fun coupons.
tt0993846,"01:37:35,965","01:37:38,793",A fun coupons.
tt0993846,"01:37:46,563","01:37:49,187",Switzerland? What the fuck is in Switzerland?
tt0993846,"01:37:49,400","01:37:50,720","Swiss fucking Banks, that's what."
tt0993846,"01:37:51,630","01:37:54,180",It was ass covering time. I had to hide my money.
tt0993846,"01:37:55,110","01:37:56,340",Enter Rugrat.
tt0993846,"01:37:56,990","01:37:59,160",He knew Swiss Banker from law school.
tt0993846,"01:37:59,360","01:38:00,360","But, he was in Geneva."
tt0993846,"01:38:00,560","01:38:03,684","And there was no way, I'm gonna make that flight sober."
tt0993846,"01:38:05,440","01:38:08,897","So, I knew if I took my drugs right. I could sleep through the entire flight."
tt0993846,"01:38:09,480","01:38:11,300","But, I had to take em, JUST RIGHT."
tt0993846,"01:38:12,050","01:38:14,549",At 4 pm I popped a few more ludes.
tt0993846,"01:38:14,550","01:38:17,552",Which started kicking in by the time I finished my sales meeting.
tt0993846,"01:38:17,752","01:38:18,752",My tingle phase.
tt0993846,"01:38:19,690","01:38:21,289",By dinner I popped a few more
tt0993846,"01:38:21,489","01:38:23,949",on top of some cocktails and a valium or two.
tt0993846,"01:38:24,149","01:38:26,207",My slur phase.
tt0993846,"01:38:28,458","01:38:30,463","By eight thirty, I popped a few more ludes."
tt0993846,"01:38:30,663","01:38:32,640",and pretty much lost my motor skills.
tt0993846,"01:38:32,840","01:38:35,346",This was the drool phase.

tt0993846,"01:40:25,996","01:40:26,996",He was fucking tasing you.

tt0993846,"01:42:12,372","01:42:14,516",Pleasure to make your acquaintance. - Nice to meet you.
tt0993846,"01:42:22,620","01:42:25,447","I'm curious about your bank secrecy laws, here."
tt0993846,"01:42:29,622","01:42:30,526","Excusez-moi, Jordan,"
tt0993846,"01:42:30,810","01:42:35,220",Swiss custom requires ten minutes of blah blah blah..
tt0993846,"01:42:35,420","01:42:36,420",Chit chat. Chit chat! Thank you.
tt0993846,"01:42:36,620","01:42:38,718",before business can be discussed.
tt0993846,"01:42:44,267","01:42:46,876","Of course, let’s get “down to it.”"
tt0993846,"01:42:47,076","01:42:48,076",What would you like to know?
tt0993846,"01:42:49,474","01:42:51,429",Under what circumstances would you be..
tt0993846,"01:42:51,629","01:42:53,903",..obligated to cooperate with an FBI
tt0993846,"01:42:54,103","01:42:57,918",or U.S. Justice Department investigation? For example.
tt0993846,"01:42:58,118","01:42:59,118",<i>Ca depend.</i>
tt0993846,"01:43:00,494","01:43:02,505",<i>Ca depend? - Oui.</i>
tt0993846,"01:43:03,754","01:43:05,898",<i>  Ca depend </i>on what? Exactly.
tt0993846,"01:43:07,086","01:43:09,984",Whether America plans to invade Switzerland in the coming months.
tt0993846,"01:43:11,554","01:43:13,330","So, check if tanks are rolling down the Rue de la Croix?"
tt0993846,"01:43:13,530","01:43:14,630","Yes, <i>Rue de la Croix</i>."
tt0993846,"01:43:30,458","01:43:35,042","<i>What I’m asking, you Swiss dick, is are you going to fuck me over.</i>"
tt0993846,"01:43:38,056","01:43:41,760","<i>I understand perfectly, you American shitheel.</i>"
tt0993846,"01:43:43,910","01:43:46,830",The only way the Banque Real de Geneve would cooperate;
tt0993846,"01:43:47,030","01:43:48,030",with a foreign legal body
tt0993846,"01:43:48,230","01:43:52,269",is if the crime being pursued is also a crime in Switzerland.
tt0993846,"01:43:52,540","01:43:56,982","But, there are very few Swiss laws which apply to your practices."
tt0993846,"01:43:57,182","01:43:59,722","From a financial standpoint,"
tt0993846,"01:43:59,922","01:44:02,784",you are now in heaven.
tt0993846,"01:44:02,984","01:44:05,047","See, I told you he's fantastic, right?"
tt0993846,"01:44:05,470","01:44:08,697","If the U.S. Justice Department sent us a subpoena,"
tt0993846,"01:44:09,200","01:44:11,747",it would become<i> papier-toillette</i>.
tt0993846,"01:44:13,591","01:44:15,423",We would wipe our ass with it.
tt0993846,"01:44:15,623","01:44:16,623","Unless, of course.."
tt0993846,"01:44:16,823","01:44:20,063",it was an investigation into stock fraud..
tt0993846,"01:44:20,263","01:44:23,192",which is a crime in Switzerland. If I'm correct.
tt0993846,"01:44:23,392","01:44:26,547","Then, there’d have to be Cooperacion."
tt0993846,"01:44:26,747","01:44:27,747","On your part, If I'm not mistaken."
tt0993846,"01:44:29,400","01:44:30,260","Yes, we would."
tt0993846,"01:44:31,580","01:44:34,355",Assuming the account is under your name.
tt0993846,"01:44:36,067","01:44:37,234",if it were..
tt0993846,"01:44:37,434","01:44:38,434",another name..
tt0993846,"01:44:40,086","01:44:42,550","A friends, Comerate, Cousin.."
tt0993846,"01:44:47,812","01:44:49,243",Relatives? Yeah.
tt0993846,"01:44:51,786","01:44:53,931",Was that yodeling I just heard or
tt0993846,"01:44:54,131","01:44:56,145",did you just say what I thought you said?
tt0993846,"01:44:56,345","01:44:58,629",Yes!  Yes!
tt0993846,"01:44:58,829","01:45:01,652",He's telling me to use a rathole.
tt0993846,"01:45:01,852","01:45:05,594","But, a U.S. rathole would never get into Switzerland with all that money."
tt0993846,"01:45:05,794","01:45:09,968",What I needed was a ratholr with a European passport.
tt0993846,"01:45:17,384","01:45:18,659",Jordan?
tt0993846,"01:45:18,859","01:45:21,735","Hey! How is my favourite Aunt, huh?"
tt0993846,"01:45:21,935","01:45:24,419","Welcome, was the traffic terrible? - No, not at all."
tt0993846,"01:45:29,030","01:45:31,360","Thank God, Aunt Emma didn't need too much convincing."
tt0993846,"01:45:32,220","01:45:34,150","Turned out, the british weren't too much different from the Swiss."
tt0993846,"01:45:34,350","01:45:37,402","Money talks. And, bullshit takes the bus."
tt0993846,"01:45:37,602","01:45:39,767",How do you say 'rathole' in British.
tt0993846,"01:45:39,967","01:45:42,187","If you get in any trouble, whatsoever."
tt0993846,"01:45:42,387","01:45:45,155",I'll come forward immediately. I'll say that I duped you.
tt0993846,"01:45:45,355","01:45:46,355",That I promise.
tt0993846,"01:45:47,784","01:45:50,325","Risk is what keeps us young, isn’t it darling?"
tt0993846,"01:45:54,657","01:45:56,211","Sometimes, I wonder"
tt0993846,"01:45:56,411","01:45:59,034","if you let money get the best of you, my love."
tt0993846,"01:45:59,234","01:46:02,744",Among other substances.
tt0993846,"01:46:07,066","01:46:09,023","It’s that obvious, huh?"
tt0993846,"01:46:09,223","01:46:11,591",It's chilly darling and you're sweating bullets.
tt0993846,"01:46:14,850","01:46:18,353","What can I say, Aunt Emma. I’m a drug addict."
tt0993846,"01:46:19,549","01:46:20,973","I really am. I mean,"
tt0993846,"01:46:21,173","01:46:22,173","Cocaine, pills.."
tt0993846,"01:46:23,913","01:46:25,908","Whatever it is, I'll fucking do it."
tt0993846,"01:46:26,108","01:46:28,212",That's the truth.
tt0993846,"01:46:28,412","01:46:31,194",I am a sex addict too.
tt0993846,"01:46:31,394","01:46:34,702","Well, there are worse things to be addicted to than sex."
tt0993846,"01:46:36,032","01:46:37,752","Jesus, why am I telling you all this?"
tt0993846,"01:46:37,952","01:46:38,952",I am sorry.
tt0993846,"01:46:40,984","01:46:42,878",Because I'm very easy to talk to.
tt0993846,"01:46:43,078","01:46:44,078",You are.
tt0993846,"01:46:44,278","01:46:46,209",You are easy to talk to.
tt0993846,"01:46:46,409","01:46:47,409",I suppose it's..
tt0993846,"01:46:49,465","01:46:51,034","It's just my job, you know, it's uh..."
tt0993846,"01:46:51,234","01:46:55,407","All these people depending on me, tens of millions of dollars at stake, you know,"
tt0993846,"01:46:55,607","01:46:57,372","Sometimes, I feel like I.."
tt0993846,"01:46:57,572","01:47:00,600","I've bitten on more than I can chew, you know?"
tt0993846,"01:47:00,800","01:47:03,344",You're a man with large appetites.
tt0993846,"01:47:03,544","01:47:04,544",Yeah.
tt0993846,"01:47:07,054","01:47:08,950","Is she, fucking hitting on me?"
tt0993846,"01:47:09,150","01:47:10,150","Yeah. Yeah, I am."
tt0993846,"01:47:13,937","01:47:16,857","I suppose, I put that on myself though, right?"
tt0993846,"01:47:17,057","01:47:18,057",My decision.
tt0993846,"01:47:18,257","01:47:20,516",It's hard to..
tt0993846,"01:47:20,716","01:47:21,716",Hard to learn to..
tt0993846,"01:47:21,916","01:47:24,988","to control the anxiety sometimes, you know?"
tt0993846,"01:47:27,146","01:47:29,824","Learn to relax, and let go."
tt0993846,"01:47:31,182","01:47:32,991",To release the tension.
tt0993846,"01:47:34,318","01:47:36,025",She is hitting on me.
tt0993846,"01:47:36,225","01:47:37,225",Holy shit!
tt0993846,"01:47:37,425","01:47:39,751","Yeah, release the tension."
tt0993846,"01:47:44,490","01:47:48,832","Suppose we, uh.. We all just need to learn not.."
tt0993846,"01:47:49,032","01:47:51,935","Learn to do what comes naturally in life, you know?"
tt0993846,"01:47:54,993","01:47:57,089",Is he fucking hitting on me?
tt0993846,"01:48:03,669","01:48:04,997","Stability, dear."

tt0993846,"01:48:19,041","01:48:20,481",Deal.
tt0993846,"01:48:26,330","01:48:30,005","We had, literally, a fuck load of money."
tt0993846,"01:48:30,205","01:48:33,051","Aunt Emma, could never carry all this by herself."
tt0993846,"01:48:33,390","01:48:37,210","So, I thought to myself, who else has European passport?"
tt0993846,"01:48:38,860","01:48:42,205","Now, Brad, as a successful drug dealer,"
tt0993846,"01:48:42,752","01:48:44,845","spent his winters in the south of France,"

tt0117060,"00:05:01,347","00:05:05,048",<i>a record of all our deep-cover agents in Eastern Europe.</i>
tt0117060,"00:05:05,143","00:05:09,271","<i>For security reasons, the NOC list is divided in two.</i>"

tt0117060,"00:05:15,656","00:05:19,155",<i>which matches the code names with their true names.</i>
tt0117060,"00:05:19,243","00:05:23,193",<i>It is this half which Golitsyn plans to steal from the embassy</i>
tt0117060,"00:05:23,289","00:05:25,116",<i>during a reception tomorrow night.</i>

tt0117060,"00:06:34,789","00:06:37,459",A very straightforward objective:
tt0117060,"00:06:37,542","00:06:39,867","we photograph Golitsyn stealing the NOC list,"
tt0117060,"00:06:39,961","00:06:42,452","follow him to his buyer,"
tt0117060,"00:06:42,547","00:06:44,873",apprehend both of them.
tt0117060,"00:06:44,967","00:06:46,876",Now here's the plot.
tt0117060,"00:06:46,969","00:06:50,754","Ethan, you're going into the embassy in character during a party."
tt0117060,"00:06:50,849","00:06:53,138",Hide in plain sight - highest possible profile.
tt0117060,"00:06:53,227","00:06:56,846",- Are you game? - Wouldn't have it any other way.
tt0117060,"00:06:56,940","00:07:00,106","Sarah, you're at the party already"
tt0117060,"00:07:00,193","00:07:02,351",as the embassy's Washington visitor liaison.
tt0117060,"00:07:02,445","00:07:05,483",Make contact with Ethan. You'll run the game together.
tt0117060,"00:07:05,575","00:07:06,986",I have nothing to wear.
tt0117060,"00:07:08,954","00:07:11,160","Well, you'll work it out."
tt0117060,"00:07:12,791","00:07:14,535","You'll mark Golitsyn, hand him to Hannah."
tt0117060,"00:07:14,627","00:07:17,877","Hannah, you'll have him for the duration of the interior."
tt0117060,"00:07:17,964","00:07:19,079",Stay on him.
tt0117060,"00:07:19,174","00:07:20,170",No problem.
tt0117060,"00:07:20,259","00:07:21,587",- Jack. - Yeah?
tt0117060,"00:07:21,677","00:07:23,254",Fingerprint security.
tt0117060,"00:07:23,345","00:07:25,671",There's access through the elevator shaft here.
tt0117060,"00:07:25,765","00:07:30,012","- So I'm not wearing my tux? - Open, close, get out."
tt0117060,"00:07:30,103","00:07:32,475",Zero residual presence.

tt0117060,"00:08:03,141","00:08:08,350",Exactly. It's even worse than the sludge you made in Kiev.

tt0117060,"00:26:12,451","00:26:15,701",<i>- Are you intact? - It's gone. Do you read me?</i>
tt0117060,"00:26:15,787","00:26:19,573",- The list is in the open! - I read you.
tt0117060,"00:26:19,668","00:26:23,452","<i>Let's bring you in safely, then we'll worry about that, OK?</i>"
tt0117060,"00:26:23,547","00:26:24,626",<i>Were you followed?</i>
tt0117060,"00:26:26,967","00:26:28,593",I don't think so.
tt0117060,"00:26:28,678","00:26:32,094",<i>Don't think. Be sure. Are you clean?</i>
tt0117060,"00:26:32,182","00:26:33,297",Yes.
tt0117060,"00:26:34,518","00:26:38,683","<i>OK. Location green, one hour. I'll be there myself.</i>"
tt0117060,"00:26:38,774","00:26:40,398",You're in Prague?
tt0117060,"00:26:40,484","00:26:42,275",<i>One hour.</i>
tt0117060,"00:27:38,134","00:27:40,092","I, uh..."
tt0117060,"00:27:40,178","00:27:43,843","I can't tell you how, er... sorry I am."
tt0117060,"00:27:43,932","00:27:48,261","I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan,"
tt0117060,"00:27:48,353","00:27:51,356",personally as well as professionally.
tt0117060,"00:27:52,776","00:27:53,772",Yeah.
tt0117060,"00:27:58,533","00:28:01,984","Here's a passport, visa. Usual drill."
tt0117060,"00:28:02,078","00:28:05,911","We'll work exfiltration through Canada, debrief you at Langley."
tt0117060,"00:28:06,000","00:28:10,414",Throw the Prague police a bone or two. Toss them a few suspects.
tt0117060,"00:28:15,135","00:28:16,333",You follow me?
tt0117060,"00:28:18,388","00:28:20,881","Yeah, I follow."
tt0117060,"00:28:20,976","00:28:24,475",I think we've lost enough agents for one night.
tt0117060,"00:28:24,563","00:28:27,766","You mean, I'VE lost enough agents for one night."
tt0117060,"00:28:29,444","00:28:32,694","You seem hell-bent on blaming yourself, Ethan."
tt0117060,"00:28:32,781","00:28:35,069",Who else is left?
tt0117060,"00:28:37,203","00:28:40,738",Yeah. I see your point.
tt0117060,"00:28:45,337","00:28:47,045",Why was there another team?
tt0117060,"00:28:48,090","00:28:49,085",What?
tt0117060,"00:28:50,969","00:28:53,543","Of IMF agents at the embassy, tonight."
tt0117060,"00:28:55,766","00:28:57,509",I don't quite follow you.
tt0117060,"00:29:00,188","00:29:03,474","Well, see if you can follow me around the room."
tt0117060,"00:29:03,566","00:29:07,102","The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7, 8 o'clock."
tt0117060,"00:29:09,156","00:29:13,155",The couple waltzing around me at the embassy at 9 and 11.
tt0117060,"00:29:13,245","00:29:16,080",The waiter standing behind Hannah at the stairs -
tt0117060,"00:29:16,164","00:29:18,406","bow tie, 12.00."
tt0117060,"00:29:18,500","00:29:20,577",The other IMF team.
tt0117060,"00:29:21,170","00:29:24,042",You're worried about me. Why?
tt0117060,"00:29:26,593","00:29:28,716","Well, for a little over two years,"
tt0117060,"00:29:28,804","00:29:32,304",we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.
tt0117060,"00:29:32,392","00:29:34,598",We have a penetration.
tt0117060,"00:29:34,686","00:29:37,557","The other day, we decoded a message on the Internet"
tt0117060,"00:29:37,648","00:29:39,724","from a Czech we know as ""Max""."
tt0117060,"00:29:39,818","00:29:40,814",The arms dealer.
tt0117060,"00:29:41,987","00:29:43,315",That's right.
tt0117060,"00:29:43,405","00:29:46,690","Max, it seems, has two unique gifts..."
tt0117060,"00:29:46,783","00:29:48,859",a capacity for anonymity
tt0117060,"00:29:48,952","00:29:51,159",and for corrupting susceptible agents.
tt0117060,"00:29:51,247","00:29:54,284","This time, he'd gotten to someone on the inside."
tt0117060,"00:29:54,376","00:29:57,827",He'd gotten in a position to buy our NOC list.
tt0117060,"00:29:57,921","00:30:01,291","An operation he referred to as Job 314,"
tt0117060,"00:30:01,384","00:30:03,958",the job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
tt0117060,"00:30:07,223","00:30:09,894",But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
tt0117060,"00:30:09,977","00:30:13,892",That's correct. The actual list is secure at Langley.
tt0117060,"00:30:13,982","00:30:16,983",Golitsyn was a lightning rod. One of ours.
tt0117060,"00:30:19,196","00:30:23,527",This whole operation was a mole hunt.
tt0117060,"00:30:29,374","00:30:32,376",This whole operation was a mole hunt.
tt0117060,"00:30:32,462","00:30:33,873",Yeah.
tt0117060,"00:30:35,757","00:30:40,468",The mole's deep inside...
tt0117060,"00:30:40,555","00:30:42,714",and like you said...
tt0117060,"00:30:45,685","00:30:47,429",you survived.
tt0117060,"00:30:49,981","00:30:53,067","I want to show you something, Ethan."
tt0117060,"00:30:54,988","00:30:56,531","Since your father's death,"
tt0117060,"00:30:56,615","00:31:00,316","your family's farm has been in receivership,"
tt0117060,"00:31:00,410","00:31:04,326","and now, suddenly, they're flush with over 120 grand in the bank."
tt0117060,"00:31:04,415","00:31:08,330",Your father's illness was supposed to have wiped out that bank account.
tt0117060,"00:31:08,419","00:31:14,258","Dying slowly in America, after all, can be an expensive proposition."
tt0117060,"00:31:15,804","00:31:17,796",So...
tt0117060,"00:31:17,889","00:31:22,184",why don't we quietly get out of here and onto a plane?
tt0117060,"00:31:25,232","00:31:27,106",I understand you're upset.
tt0117060,"00:31:27,192","00:31:30,229","Kittridge, you've never seen me upset."
tt0117060,"00:31:30,320","00:31:32,859","All right, Hunt. Enough is enough."
tt0117060,"00:31:32,949","00:31:35,274","You have bribed, cajoled, and killed,"
tt0117060,"00:31:35,368","00:31:37,693",and you've done it from the inside.
tt0117060,"00:31:37,787","00:31:41,490","You want to court the devil, fine. Do it in hell."
tt0117060,"00:33:43,225","00:33:46,346","Money, money. Where's the damn money?"
tt0117060,"00:34:12,300","00:34:15,469","<i>The other day, we decoded a message on the Internet</i>"
tt0117060,"00:34:15,555","00:34:18,722","<i>from a Czech we know as ""Max"".</i>"

tt0117060,"00:37:31,282","00:37:32,824",what are you doing?
tt0117060,"00:37:34,870","00:37:40,327","I needed you, Ethan. I needed you... on the bridge..."
tt0117060,"00:37:40,418","00:37:42,327",but you weren't there.
tt0117060,"00:37:45,340","00:37:46,835",Ethan...
tt0117060,"00:37:49,261","00:37:50,258",Ethan...
tt0117060,"00:37:51,848","00:37:52,844",Ethan?
tt0117060,"00:37:58,856","00:38:00,101",Don't move.
tt0117060,"00:38:01,651","00:38:03,394",Ethan...
tt0117060,"00:38:03,486","00:38:04,684","Ethan, it's OK."
tt0117060,"00:38:04,779","00:38:09,941",Just calm down. It's Claire. It's OK.
tt0117060,"00:38:10,036","00:38:11,945",You were in the car.
tt0117060,"00:38:12,038","00:38:13,746","No, I wasn't."
tt0117060,"00:38:15,500","00:38:17,161",I heard on the radio...
tt0117060,"00:38:17,294","00:38:21,163",Shut up! I saw you. You were in the car.
tt0117060,"00:38:21,258","00:38:23,546","No, I got out of the car."
tt0117060,"00:38:23,635","00:38:26,590",I ran to the bridge. He said someone was...
tt0117060,"00:38:26,681","00:38:31,343",Don't give me that. I was there. There was nobody on the bridge.
tt0117060,"00:38:31,435","00:38:34,935",- What happened to Jim? - Wake up! Jim's dead!
tt0117060,"00:38:35,022","00:38:37,064",They're dead! They're all dead!
tt0117060,"00:38:44,868","00:38:48,072",- Who sent you for me? - Jim's dead...
tt0117060,"00:38:48,163","00:38:51,368",- Who sent you here? - Jim...
tt0117060,"00:38:51,459","00:38:53,369",Take off your coat.
tt0117060,"00:39:01,470","00:39:02,965","Where were you, huh?"
tt0117060,"00:39:03,055","00:39:07,636",- I... - Huh? Where were you?
tt0117060,"00:39:08,855","00:39:12,983",I walked away. He said abort. I just... walked away.
tt0117060,"00:39:13,067","00:39:16,021",That was four hours ago. Who sent you?
tt0117060,"00:39:16,112","00:39:18,984","- Did they send you? - Who's ""they""?"
tt0117060,"00:39:20,534","00:39:24,284","- Look, who sent you? - No one sent me."
tt0117060,"00:39:24,372","00:39:27,992",We were supposed to be back here at four o'clock.
tt0117060,"00:39:28,085","00:39:32,166","If we abort, we don't return here until 4.00, 0400, 4 a.m..."
tt0117060,"00:39:32,256","00:39:35,174","4 o'clock, Ethan. 4.00..."
tt0117060,"00:39:35,259","00:39:39,176",If we abort... 4 a.m...
tt0117060,"00:39:58,704","00:40:00,863",I've been disavowed.
tt0117060,"00:40:06,837","00:40:10,374",They actually think I killed Jim and everyone else.
tt0117060,"00:40:16,474","00:40:20,389","Somehow $100,000 finds its way into my parents' bank account."
tt0117060,"00:40:20,479","00:40:23,434",Kittridge assumes I'm the mole they've been tracing
tt0117060,"00:40:23,525","00:40:27,273","and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max,"
tt0117060,"00:40:27,362","00:40:31,408",for the last two years... to get him our NOC list.
tt0117060,"00:40:31,701","00:40:36,659",- What are you going to do? - I'm going to get it for him.
tt0117060,"00:40:38,458","00:40:40,867","Ethan, you're not making any sense."
tt0117060,"00:40:42,881","00:40:46,712",Whoever the mole is goes by the name of Job.
tt0117060,"00:40:46,801","00:40:51,844","I can't find him, but if he knows I have the NOC list,"
tt0117060,"00:40:51,932","00:40:53,261",he'll find me.
tt0117060,"00:40:53,350","00:40:58,513",I'm going in and telling Kittridge you had nothing to do with this.
tt0117060,"00:40:58,608","00:41:04,693","Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me."
tt0117060,"00:41:19,548","00:41:21,837",The message is for Job.
tt0117060,"00:41:23,636","00:41:25,179",That's right...
tt0117060,"00:41:25,263","00:41:27,801",and I'm going to answer it.
tt0117060,"00:41:50,751","00:41:55,747",Excuse me. Can I trouble you for a match?
tt0117060,"00:42:11,776","00:42:14,148","Could you remove your hat, please?"
tt0117060,"00:42:17,198","00:42:18,277",Why?
tt0117060,"00:42:18,366","00:42:20,573",You wish to meet Max?
tt0117060,"00:42:20,661","00:42:23,152",The price of admission.
tt0117060,"00:42:32,091","00:42:35,175",I thought I was going to see Max.
tt0117060,"00:42:35,261","00:42:38,381",You misunderstood. No one sees Max.
tt0117060,"00:42:38,472","00:42:41,640",Then what the hell am I doing here?
tt0117060,"00:42:41,727","00:42:46,354",Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
tt0117060,"00:42:46,441","00:42:49,110",I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
tt0117060,"00:42:49,193","00:42:52,314","If Max doesn't like what you have to say,"
tt0117060,"00:42:52,406","00:42:55,989",you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
tt0117060,"00:42:56,076","00:42:59,661",I'm willing to take the chance.
tt0117060,"00:43:04,795","00:43:06,373",Very well.
tt0117060,"00:43:09,635","00:43:15,140",Who are you and what are you doing here?
tt0117060,"00:43:15,225","00:43:18,640","I need $150,000."
tt0117060,"00:43:18,728","00:43:21,600","Oh, really?"
tt0117060,"00:43:25,152","00:43:26,148",You... you...
tt0117060,"00:43:26,237","00:43:30,651","You thought if you simply showed up, I might give it to you?"
tt0117060,"00:43:31,827","00:43:34,579",Why not? You gave Job 125.
tt0117060,"00:43:36,123","00:43:41,629",Hmm... the penny drops. You are not Job.
tt0117060,"00:43:41,797","00:43:48,132",Job is not given to quoting scripture in his communications.
tt0117060,"00:43:48,221","00:43:50,428","Then there was its tone,"
tt0117060,"00:43:50,516","00:43:53,137",aggressive but playful.
tt0117060,"00:43:53,227","00:43:55,219",Job is not playful.
tt0117060,"00:43:56,397","00:44:00,479",So you are something of a paradox.
tt0117060,"00:44:00,570","00:44:02,230","Well, that depends."
tt0117060,"00:44:02,321","00:44:03,317",On what?
tt0117060,"00:44:03,406","00:44:05,979",Whether you like a paradox.
tt0117060,"00:44:08,035","00:44:11,121","I want $150,000 today."
tt0117060,"00:44:11,206","00:44:13,115",That's quite out of the question.
tt0117060,"00:44:15,878","00:44:17,752",The disk Job sold you...
tt0117060,"00:44:17,839","00:44:19,582",it's worthless.
tt0117060,"00:44:19,674","00:44:22,925",It's bait... part of an internal mole hunt.
tt0117060,"00:44:28,017","00:44:30,557",And how might you know that?
tt0117060,"00:44:32,064","00:44:34,390",Are you another company man?
tt0117060,"00:44:36,652","00:44:38,063",Like Job?
tt0117060,"00:44:38,154","00:44:39,613",Hmm...
tt0117060,"00:44:41,617","00:44:44,190",We're asking about you.
tt0117060,"00:44:45,496","00:44:47,240",I'm NOC...
tt0117060,"00:44:47,332","00:44:50,867",Was... Now disavowed.
tt0117060,"00:44:50,961","00:44:53,631","Why, may I ask?"
tt0117060,"00:44:53,714","00:44:56,881",That is the question I want to ask Job.
tt0117060,"00:44:56,967","00:45:02,343",I don't know Job any more than Job knows me.
tt0117060,"00:45:02,433","00:45:03,761",Even so...
tt0117060,"00:45:03,851","00:45:06,389",I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
tt0117060,"00:45:06,479","00:45:07,890",Why should I?
tt0117060,"00:45:07,980","00:45:10,352",I can deliver the actual NOC list.
tt0117060,"00:45:10,441","00:45:12,933",The one you have is worthless
tt0117060,"00:45:13,028","00:45:16,564",and certain to have a homing device to pinpoint your location.
tt0117060,"00:45:16,658","00:45:17,772",Mm-hmm.
tt0117060,"00:45:19,953","00:45:21,033",Mm-hmm...
tt0117060,"00:45:21,121","00:45:23,114",Boot it up.
tt0117060,"00:45:23,207","00:45:25,116","In 30 seconds to 10 minutes,"
tt0117060,"00:45:25,209","00:45:28,660",you'll have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like rabbits.
tt0117060,"00:45:30,256","00:45:33,757",It's easy to say the disk is worthless
tt0117060,"00:45:33,844","00:45:37,842",when you say I can't look and see if it's worthless.
tt0117060,"00:45:37,932","00:45:40,055","Not a tenable position, sir."
tt0117060,"00:45:41,436","00:45:44,307","OK. Use it, but..."
tt0117060,"00:45:45,399","00:45:48,235",I'd suggest you pack first.
tt0117060,"00:46:03,379","00:46:05,917","26-27. So far, so good."
tt0117060,"00:46:06,007","00:46:08,545","Not so good for you, my friend."
tt0117060,"00:46:08,634","00:46:11,006",I'd say you've got about two minutes.
tt0117060,"00:46:43,133","00:46:45,126",32 and 33.
tt0117060,"00:46:45,218","00:46:48,505",Doesn't mean a signal. Could just be heating up.
tt0117060,"00:46:55,272","00:46:57,395",44 and 45.
tt0117060,"00:47:12,876","00:47:13,872",Now.
tt0117060,"00:47:46,498","00:47:48,040","Man's gone black, Barnes."
tt0117060,"00:47:48,125","00:47:51,874",He's under until he decides to surface.
tt0117060,"00:47:51,963","00:47:55,712",We'll involve the local authorities. Cut off his transportation.
tt0117060,"00:47:55,801","00:47:58,292","What can we do, Barnes?"
tt0117060,"00:47:58,429","00:48:02,972",Put a guy at the airport? How many identities do you think Hunt has?
tt0117060,"00:48:03,059","00:48:07,058",How many times has he slipped past customs in how many countries?
tt0117060,"00:48:07,148","00:48:09,436",These guys are trained to be ghosts.
tt0117060,"00:48:09,525","00:48:13,394","- We taught them, for Christ's sake. - What do you suggest?"
tt0117060,"00:48:15,574","00:48:19,618",Let's not waste time chasing him. Let's make him come to us.
tt0117060,"00:48:19,703","00:48:21,578","Everybody has pressure points, Barnes."
tt0117060,"00:48:21,664","00:48:26,908",You find something that's personally important to him and you squeeze.
tt0117060,"00:48:30,674","00:48:35,884",Gunther will never let me have one of his apartments again.
tt0117060,"00:48:35,973","00:48:39,259","Sorry I doubted you, dear boy."
tt0117060,"00:48:39,352","00:48:41,143",You are a good sport.
tt0117060,"00:48:41,228","00:48:42,391","Thanks, Max."
tt0117060,"00:48:43,439","00:48:44,899",Or is it Maxine?
tt0117060,"00:48:45,025","00:48:48,311",Ha ha. I don't have to tell you
tt0117060,"00:48:48,403","00:48:51,322",what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession.
tt0117060,"00:48:52,492","00:48:55,944",It's like a warm blanket.
tt0117060,"00:48:57,790","00:49:02,250",My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.
tt0117060,"00:49:02,336","00:49:04,543",Obviously it didn't pass muster. Deal's off.
tt0117060,"00:49:05,757","00:49:07,916",What was your deal with Job?
tt0117060,"00:49:08,094","00:49:10,798",Um...$6 million.
tt0117060,"00:49:10,888","00:49:12,797","I'll give you the same,"
tt0117060,"00:49:12,890","00:49:16,260","but I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe."
tt0117060,"00:49:16,353","00:49:19,638",I won't do this piecemeal. It's too dangerous. The entire list.
tt0117060,"00:49:19,731","00:49:20,727",10 million.
tt0117060,"00:49:20,816","00:49:24,352",10 million in negotiable US Treasury certificates
tt0117060,"00:49:24,446","00:49:28,658","in bearer form, coupons attached, and one more thing."
tt0117060,"00:49:30,619","00:49:35,745",Your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
tt0117060,"00:49:47,889","00:49:48,885",Oh.
tt0117060,"00:49:51,268","00:49:54,186",Max made a deal with you?
tt0117060,"00:49:54,272","00:49:57,973","I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job."
tt0117060,"00:49:59,778","00:50:02,696","We've got 75 rounds for your Beretta,"
tt0117060,"00:50:02,781","00:50:04,989",but only 20 for the Sig Sauer.
tt0117060,"00:50:05,076","00:50:09,122",One pair of Visco glasses with monitor.
tt0117060,"00:50:09,206","00:50:10,701","Plenty of passports, and..."
tt0117060,"00:50:15,797","00:50:16,829",What?
tt0117060,"00:50:16,923","00:50:22,345","You said it yourself, if I'm not dead, I'm with you."
tt0117060,"00:50:23,765","00:50:25,592",Are you sure about this?
tt0117060,"00:50:25,684","00:50:27,724",Jim was my husband.
tt0117060,"00:50:27,811","00:50:30,516",I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
tt0117060,"00:50:32,024","00:50:35,809","We're going to need some help. We don't have a lot of time,"
tt0117060,"00:50:35,904","00:50:37,813",so they'll have to be local.
tt0117060,"00:50:37,906","00:50:38,903",What kind of help?
tt0117060,"00:51:12,822","00:51:14,731",Simple game.
tt0117060,"00:51:14,824","00:51:16,698",Four players.
tt0117060,"00:51:16,785","00:51:19,358",Exfil opens the pocket.
tt0117060,"00:51:19,454","00:51:21,162",Cyber ops lifts the wallet.
tt0117060,"00:51:21,248","00:51:23,287",Bank?
tt0117060,"00:51:24,376","00:51:25,920",IMF mainframe.
tt0117060,"00:51:27,381","00:51:28,840",Where exactly is it?
tt0117060,"00:51:28,924","00:51:30,205",In Langley.
tt0117060,"00:51:33,637","00:51:34,716",In Langley?
tt0117060,"00:51:34,805","00:51:37,641","The one in Virginia, Langley?"
tt0117060,"00:51:37,726","00:51:41,724",Inside CIA headquarters at Langley?
tt0117060,"00:51:42,857","00:51:44,351",Is he serious?
tt0117060,"00:51:44,442","00:51:46,435",Always.
tt0117060,"00:51:47,863","00:51:52,738","If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox?"
tt0117060,"00:51:52,826","00:51:57,075",I can fly a helicopter through the lobby and land inside the vault.
tt0117060,"00:51:57,166","00:52:01,413",And it would be easier than breaking into the goddamn CIA.
tt0117060,"00:52:01,503","00:52:02,748",What are we downloading?
tt0117060,"00:52:02,838","00:52:04,083",Information.
tt0117060,"00:52:04,173","00:52:05,168",What kind?
tt0117060,"00:52:05,257","00:52:06,421",Profitable.
tt0117060,"00:52:07,927","00:52:09,338",Payment on delivery.
tt0117060,"00:52:11,641","00:52:16,138",I don't know. I just don't know.
tt0117060,"00:52:17,731","00:52:22,108","Well, this doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I heard of."
tt0117060,"00:52:22,194","00:52:24,482","What did they call you, the Net Ranger?"
tt0117060,"00:52:24,571","00:52:26,316",Phineas Phreak?
tt0117060,"00:52:27,076","00:52:30,112",The only man alive who actually hacked Nato Ghostcom.
tt0117060,"00:52:30,204","00:52:32,280",There was never any physical evidence
tt0117060,"00:52:32,373","00:52:35,788",that I had anything to do with that... with that...
tt0117060,"00:52:36,294","00:52:39,544",that exceptional piece of work.
tt0117060,"00:52:43,010","00:52:45,584",You don't know what you're missing.
tt0117060,"00:52:45,680","00:52:48,717",This is the Mount Everest of hacks.
tt0117060,"00:52:48,809","00:52:51,097",You're all kidding yourselves.
tt0117060,"00:52:51,186","00:52:55,563","Even with top of the line crypto, Cray access, STU 3s..."
tt0117060,"00:52:55,649","00:52:57,774","Krieger can get it, right?"
tt0117060,"00:52:58,946","00:53:00,855",May take a little time.
tt0117060,"00:53:00,948","00:53:02,656","""A little time""?"
tt0117060,"00:53:02,741","00:53:04,817",That's not what Claire tells me about you.
tt0117060,"00:53:05,119","00:53:07,741",Thinking-machine laptops.
tt0117060,"00:53:09,124","00:53:12,041",I'm talking about the 686 prototypes
tt0117060,"00:53:12,127","00:53:14,879",with the artificial intelligence risk chip.
tt0117060,"00:53:14,964","00:53:15,960",24 hours.
tt0117060,"00:53:17,926","00:53:22,505","And, uh... I get to keep the equipment when we're done."
tt0117060,"00:53:22,597","00:53:25,468","Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses."
tt0117060,"00:53:30,482","00:53:34,527","Look, uh... I just can't hack my way inside."
tt0117060,"00:53:34,611","00:53:38,480","See, there's no modem access to the mainframe."
tt0117060,"00:53:38,575","00:53:40,947","It's in what we call the stand alone,"
tt0117060,"00:53:41,036","00:53:45,533",which means I'll have to be physically at the terminal.
tt0117060,"00:53:46,834","00:53:47,831","Relax, Luther."
tt0117060,"00:53:47,919","00:53:50,707",It's much worse than you think.
tt0117060,"00:53:50,797","00:53:53,715",The terminal is in a black vault lockdown.
tt0117060,"00:53:53,800","00:53:56,126",The only person allowed in the room
tt0117060,"00:53:56,219","00:53:58,891",has to pass through a series of security checks.
tt0117060,"00:53:58,974","00:54:00,385",William Donloe.
tt0117060,"00:54:00,476","00:54:02,717",The first is a voiceprint identification
tt0117060,"00:54:02,811","00:54:04,934",and a six-digit access code.
tt0117060,"00:54:08,610","00:54:11,895",This only gets him into the outer room.
tt0117060,"00:54:11,988","00:54:14,907","Next, he has to pass a retinal scan."
tt0117060,"00:54:17,913","00:54:20,748","And finally, the intrusion countermeasures"
tt0117060,"00:54:20,832","00:54:24,415",are only deactivated by a double electronic key card...
tt0117060,"00:54:24,503","00:54:26,211",which we won't have.
tt0117060,"00:54:28,257","00:54:32,920","Now, inside the black vault, there are three systems operating"
tt0117060,"00:54:33,013","00:54:35,421",whenever the technician is out of the room.
tt0117060,"00:54:35,516","00:54:37,723",The first is sound sensitive -
tt0117060,"00:54:37,811","00:54:40,218",anything above a whisper sets it off.
tt0117060,"00:54:41,940","00:54:45,061",The second system detects any increase in temperature.
tt0117060,"00:54:45,152","00:54:48,653",Even the body heat of an unauthorised person in the room
tt0117060,"00:54:48,740","00:54:52,738",will trigger it if the temperature rises just a single degree.
tt0117060,"00:54:56,081","00:54:59,036",That temperature is controlled by the air conditioning
tt0117060,"00:54:59,127","00:55:03,208",coming in through an overhead duct 30 feet above the floor.
tt0117060,"00:55:05,426","00:55:08,047",That vent is guarded by a laser net.
tt0117060,"00:55:11,057","00:55:14,972",The third system is on the floor and is pressure sensitive.
tt0117060,"00:55:15,061","00:55:19,108","The slightest increase in weight will trigger the alarm,"
tt0117060,"00:55:19,192","00:55:22,063","and any one of these systems,"
tt0117060,"00:55:22,154","00:55:27,658","if set off, will activate an automatic lockdown."
tt0117060,"00:55:27,743","00:55:31,825","Now... believe me when I tell you, gentlemen, all three systems"
tt0117060,"00:55:31,915","00:55:33,540",are state-of-the-art.
tt0117060,"00:55:36,503","00:55:39,422",And you really think we can do this?
tt0117060,"00:56:16,216","00:56:20,678","We picked up alarms in Sectors 3, 7, and 12."
tt0117060,"00:56:20,764","00:56:22,970",<i>Where's the air conditioning?</i>
tt0117060,"00:56:23,058","00:56:25,763",<i>- 21. - There's no alarm in Sector 21.</i>
tt0117060,"00:56:25,852","00:56:29,721","<i>- I got to shut it down. - Sorry, nobody gets in there.</i>"
tt0117060,"00:56:29,816","00:56:32,188",<i>You want fire through this building?</i>
tt0117060,"00:56:32,276","00:56:36,227","<i>No one goes into any sector where the alarm hasn't gone off,</i>"
tt0117060,"00:56:36,323","00:56:37,319",<i>and it hasn't...</i>
tt0117060,"00:56:37,408","00:56:38,736",<i>Wait.</i>
tt0117060,"00:56:41,996","00:56:43,704",<i>It's gone off.</i>
tt0117060,"00:56:43,790","00:56:45,414",Let's move.
tt0117060,"00:56:56,346","00:56:58,837",Can I get you anything?
tt0117060,"00:56:58,932","00:57:00,593","No, thank you."
tt0117060,"00:57:02,937","00:57:05,061",21's through here.
tt0117060,"00:57:11,281","00:57:13,653",He's recruiting. For what purpose?
tt0117060,"00:57:14,826","00:57:15,941",Survival.
tt0117060,"00:57:16,036","00:57:19,287",Too short-sighted. This guy initiates. He's proactive.
tt0117060,"00:57:19,373","00:57:23,454","The question is, what does he want? Where does he need to get it?"
tt0117060,"00:57:23,545","00:57:25,419","Barnes, what's that noise?"
tt0117060,"00:57:25,505","00:57:28,079","Uh, the fire alarm, Gene."
tt0117060,"00:57:30,261","00:57:32,384",Do we have to evacuate?
tt0117060,"00:58:18,775","00:58:23,154","Hey, there were three of you. Where's the other guy?"
tt0117060,"00:58:26,410","00:58:28,319",Zero body count.
tt0117060,"00:58:28,412","00:58:29,443",We'll see.
tt0117060,"01:00:02,855","01:00:04,136","Hi, there."
tt0117060,"01:01:05,052","01:01:06,712",One.
tt0117060,"01:01:06,804","01:01:07,883",Two.
tt0117060,"01:01:07,972","01:01:10,215",Three.

tt0117060,"01:11:43,588","01:11:46,257",It's... for you.
tt0117060,"01:11:47,717","01:11:48,713",Kittridge.
tt0117060,"01:12:11,746","01:12:14,319",You and I know about this.
tt0117060,"01:12:14,415","01:12:16,573","That's where it stops, you understand?"
tt0117060,"01:12:16,667","01:12:18,826",- It never happened. - What about him?
tt0117060,"01:12:18,920","01:12:24,163",I want him manning a radar tower in Alaska. Mail him his clothes.
tt0117060,"01:13:03,764","01:13:05,887",You contacting your buyer?
tt0117060,"01:13:07,726","01:13:09,636",Ethan?

tt0117060,"01:13:26,748","01:13:29,834",Excuse me. Mr Hunt.
tt0117060,"01:13:39,263","01:13:41,589",You're not going to any meeting without me.
tt0117060,"01:13:43,728","01:13:46,563",My contact is extremely shy.
tt0117060,"01:13:48,232","01:13:52,527","I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?"
tt0117060,"01:13:52,613","01:13:55,567",Not while I'm holding this.
tt0117060,"01:13:55,657","01:13:56,772",Krieger...
tt0117060,"01:14:03,042","01:14:04,500",You mean this?
tt0117060,"01:14:04,585","01:14:07,040",That's not the list.
tt0117060,"01:14:07,129","01:14:10,664",What's the matter? You've never seen this trick?
tt0117060,"01:14:18,726","01:14:20,932",Where'd it go?
tt0117060,"01:14:23,774","01:14:25,731",It's gone.
tt0117060,"01:14:26,652","01:14:28,062",What?
tt0117060,"01:14:28,153","01:14:29,149",You.
tt0117060,"01:14:29,238","01:14:30,234",No.
tt0117060,"01:14:30,323","01:14:31,568",No?
tt0117060,"01:14:31,658","01:14:32,939","No, come on."
tt0117060,"01:14:37,206","01:14:38,617",But not too far.
tt0117060,"01:14:42,837","01:14:44,747","I know what you're thinking, Krieger."
tt0117060,"01:14:44,839","01:14:47,414","You're thinking, back in the computer room,"
tt0117060,"01:14:47,510","01:14:50,713","I was up here, he was... he was down there."
tt0117060,"01:14:52,516","01:14:54,758","Yes, and he was..."
tt0117060,"01:14:54,851","01:14:58,303",he was carrying two disks.
tt0117060,"01:14:58,397","01:15:02,479",So hard to keep track of these things.
tt0117060,"01:15:03,404","01:15:04,518",Where is it?
tt0117060,"01:15:18,379","01:15:22,424",Do you actually think I'd let you have the NOC list?
tt0117060,"01:15:24,011","01:15:28,139","Try any sleight of hand with my money, and I'll cut your throat."
tt0117060,"01:15:53,170","01:15:56,586",<i>You're off on one of your cushy recruiting assignments again?</i>
tt0117060,"01:15:56,673","01:15:59,544","<i>Yeah. Where'd they put you up this time, the Plaza?</i>"
tt0117060,"01:15:59,635","01:16:01,045","<i>Drake Hotel, Chicago.</i>"
tt0117060,"01:16:03,599","01:16:05,638",I'm so sorry.
tt0117060,"01:16:11,899","01:16:14,355",Krieger was my call.
tt0117060,"01:16:20,576","01:16:22,284","I'm sorry, Ethan."
tt0117060,"01:16:27,459","01:16:30,128",We did what we had to do.
tt0117060,"01:16:30,837","01:16:34,255",I'm going to try and get some sleep.
tt0117060,"01:17:12,136","01:17:14,260",Krieger did have the NOC list?
tt0117060,"01:17:23,065","01:17:26,981",- You hold on to it. - What makes you trust me?
tt0117060,"01:17:27,070","01:17:30,274","Because if you knew about it, you never would have done it."
tt0117060,"01:17:36,624","01:17:39,909",I'm not going to let this get out in the open.
tt0117060,"01:17:40,002","01:17:43,501",Exactly. That's your job tomorrow on the train.
tt0117060,"01:17:43,589","01:17:46,507",Don't let this NOC list get out in the open.
tt0117060,"01:17:53,309","01:17:55,718",What is the range of this thing?
tt0117060,"01:17:55,812","01:17:59,063",It's hard to tell. We're going to have to be close.
tt0117060,"01:18:00,442","01:18:02,980","Ethan, I need to talk to you."
tt0117060,"01:18:03,779","01:18:05,238",<i>The unlikely setting -</i>
tt0117060,"01:18:05,324","01:18:08,740","<i>a farm in the heartland of America, the state of Wisconsin,</i>"
tt0117060,"01:18:08,827","01:18:11,579",<i>where Federal Agents claim to have found the brains</i>
tt0117060,"01:18:11,664","01:18:13,455",<i>behind an international drug ring.</i>
tt0117060,"01:18:13,540","01:18:16,708",<i>The operation was masterminded by Margaret Ethan Hunt</i>
tt0117060,"01:18:16,795","01:18:18,834",<i>and her brother-in-law Donald Hunt.</i>
tt0117060,"01:18:18,922","01:18:20,797",<i>They were arrested this morning</i>
tt0117060,"01:18:20,883","01:18:24,418",<i>by drug enforcement officers in a major sting operation</i>
tt0117060,"01:18:24,512","01:18:27,182",<i>designed to expose the illegal manufacture</i>
tt0117060,"01:18:27,266","01:18:30,101","<i>of the drug Methcathinone, known as Cat.</i>"
tt0117060,"01:18:30,185","01:18:32,890",<i>- What we have here... - Kittridge.</i>
tt0117060,"01:19:02,806","01:19:04,004",Kittridge.
tt0117060,"01:19:04,099","01:19:06,638",I see you've been out visiting the folks.
tt0117060,"01:19:06,728","01:19:09,932",It's Hunt. What do you need for a pinpoint?
tt0117060,"01:19:10,024","01:19:13,475","You've been watching a little TV, have you?"
tt0117060,"01:19:14,778","01:19:18,824",Hauling mom off to jail in shackles was an especially nice touch.
tt0117060,"01:19:18,909","01:19:20,189",He's in England.
tt0117060,"01:19:20,285","01:19:21,281",Get MI5.
tt0117060,"01:19:21,369","01:19:23,078","Ethan, I want to assure you"
tt0117060,"01:19:23,164","01:19:26,664",that my first order of business after you come in
tt0117060,"01:19:26,752","01:19:30,286",is to have these ridiculous charges against your family dropped
tt0117060,"01:19:30,380","01:19:32,706",and eliminated completely from their files.
tt0117060,"01:19:32,799","01:19:35,718","If you, uh, if you come in now,"
tt0117060,"01:19:35,803","01:19:39,138",we can plea down the charges against you as well.
tt0117060,"01:19:40,684","01:19:42,760","Can I ask you something, Kittridge?"
tt0117060,"01:19:44,271","01:19:45,765","Certainly, Ethan."
tt0117060,"01:19:45,857","01:19:51,611","If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed,"
tt0117060,"01:19:51,696","01:19:54,568","shot, and detonated"
tt0117060,"01:19:54,659","01:19:57,945",five members of his own IMF team...
tt0117060,"01:19:59,248","01:20:01,573",how devastated do you think he'll be
tt0117060,"01:20:01,667","01:20:04,621",by marching Ma and Uncle Donald to the county courthouse?
tt0117060,"01:20:04,711","01:20:08,046","<i>I don't know, Ethan. Why don't you tell me?</i>"
tt0117060,"01:20:10,552","01:20:11,833",Lost him.
tt0117060,"01:20:14,181","01:20:15,675",We needed three more seconds.
tt0117060,"01:20:15,766","01:20:18,685",He wanted us to know he was in London.
tt0117060,"01:20:31,702","01:20:34,572",You're a hard man to catch up with.
tt0117060,"01:20:42,840","01:20:46,339",The next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house.
tt0117060,"01:20:46,427","01:20:50,046","I must have just missed you. Anyway, I checked our aliases."
tt0117060,"01:20:50,140","01:20:52,216",Then you followed us to the States.
tt0117060,"01:20:52,309","01:20:55,097",But you left before I could get there.
tt0117060,"01:20:55,187","01:20:57,858",Smaller countries don't computerise customs records.
tt0117060,"01:20:57,941","01:21:00,313",So I watched Europe.
tt0117060,"01:21:00,402","01:21:03,438","Once you turned up in England, it was easy."
tt0117060,"01:21:03,530","01:21:06,199",You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
tt0117060,"01:21:06,283","01:21:08,111","Hey, I showed them to you."
tt0117060,"01:21:10,456","01:21:11,866",I remember.
tt0117060,"01:21:13,667","01:21:15,707",Who do you think you're kidding here?
tt0117060,"01:21:15,794","01:21:19,046",A doctor's got to see you. You can't sit up straight.
tt0117060,"01:21:19,132","01:21:23,082",I can sit up straight. I just can't sit up straight very well.
tt0117060,"01:21:23,178","01:21:26,548",Sit down. Sit down. It's not important.
tt0117060,"01:21:28,101","01:21:29,097",Ethan...
tt0117060,"01:21:31,647","01:21:33,105",I saw who shot me.
tt0117060,"01:21:33,190","01:21:36,144",I saw the mole.
tt0117060,"01:21:36,234","01:21:38,027",It was Kittridge.
tt0117060,"01:21:38,112","01:21:39,986",Kittridge.
tt0117060,"01:21:40,073","01:21:42,113","Kittridge, Ethan."
tt0117060,"01:21:47,749","01:21:50,501",Kittridge is the mole.
tt0117060,"01:21:50,585","01:21:52,494","My God, of course. You're right."
tt0117060,"01:21:58,512","01:22:00,588",He was at the embassy that night.
tt0117060,"01:22:04,142","01:22:08,011","First, he took out Jack at the elevator."
tt0117060,"01:22:15,739","01:22:18,148",He shot you on the bridge.
tt0117060,"01:22:47,234","01:22:48,860",Ethan!
tt0117060,"01:23:01,710","01:23:06,123",He must have had back-up to take out Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence.
tt0117060,"01:23:24,569","01:23:26,728",How did he do Hannah?
tt0117060,"01:23:51,851","01:23:55,766",No. No. He could have done Hannah himself.
tt0117060,"01:24:22,137","01:24:23,465","Why, Jim?"
tt0117060,"01:24:25,765","01:24:26,797",Why?
tt0117060,"01:24:29,729","01:24:34,273","When you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable. No more cold war."
tt0117060,"01:24:34,359","01:24:37,775",No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself.
tt0117060,"01:24:37,863","01:24:42,075",Operations - you answer to no one but yourself.
tt0117060,"01:24:42,160","01:24:44,152",And then one day you wake up.
tt0117060,"01:24:44,245","01:24:48,160",The President is running the country without your permission.
tt0117060,"01:24:48,250","01:24:51,122",The son of a bitch. How dare he?
tt0117060,"01:24:51,796","01:24:53,919",Then you realise it's over.
tt0117060,"01:24:54,007","01:24:57,127",You're an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading.
tt0117060,"01:24:57,218","01:25:00,423",You've got a lousy marriage and 62 grand a year.
tt0117060,"01:25:02,351","01:25:03,975",Kittridge...
tt0117060,"01:25:04,061","01:25:07,512",We'll go after the no-good son of a bitch big time.
tt0117060,"01:25:12,445","01:25:14,936",We won't have to.
tt0117060,"01:25:15,031","01:25:17,108",He'll come after us.
tt0117060,"01:25:17,201","01:25:19,526",What's going to make him do that?
tt0117060,"01:25:19,620","01:25:23,619",What he didn't get in Prague - the NOC list.
tt0117060,"01:25:25,919","01:25:27,496",Whoa.
tt0117060,"01:25:27,587","01:25:29,331","Jesus, Ethan."
tt0117060,"01:25:30,883","01:25:33,553",Good for you. Phew.
tt0117060,"01:25:33,637","01:25:36,922","I'm meeting tomorrow on the TGV, en route to Paris."
tt0117060,"01:25:37,015","01:25:39,471",Tight security. No guns.
tt0117060,"01:25:39,559","01:25:41,138",A real plus.
tt0117060,"01:25:41,229","01:25:43,850","If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max,"
tt0117060,"01:25:43,940","01:25:46,229",Max has agreed to deliver Job to me.
tt0117060,"01:25:46,317","01:25:49,568",I'll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.
tt0117060,"01:25:49,655","01:25:51,981",Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
tt0117060,"01:25:55,161","01:25:56,157",Jim?
tt0117060,"01:26:05,799","01:26:08,171","I was in a cafe waiting for you, Ethan."
tt0117060,"01:26:11,347","01:26:13,174",And there she was...
tt0117060,"01:26:13,266","01:26:15,757",standing in the rain...
tt0117060,"01:26:15,852","01:26:17,180","alive and beautiful,"
tt0117060,"01:26:17,270","01:26:20,141",thinking I'm dead and gone.
tt0117060,"01:26:22,777","01:26:26,727","God knows what she's had to do to forget me, to keep going,"
tt0117060,"01:26:26,823","01:26:28,103",to get the job done.
tt0117060,"01:26:32,246","01:26:36,494","She can't know about me, Ethan. No one can until this is over."
tt0117060,"01:26:36,585","01:26:38,577",You're probably right.
tt0117060,"01:26:38,670","01:26:41,209",There's too much at stake.
tt0117060,"01:26:43,843","01:26:48,256","Once we leave the safe house, Jim, you get in there and crash."
tt0117060,"01:26:48,348","01:26:50,425",I'll call you from Paris.
tt0117060,"01:26:50,517","01:26:51,763",You got it.
tt0117060,"01:27:14,879","01:27:16,160",What happened?
tt0117060,"01:27:20,344","01:27:22,384",I sent the message to Max.
tt0117060,"01:27:26,434","01:27:28,059",We're on for tomorrow.
tt0117060,"01:27:35,988","01:27:37,268",OK.
tt0117060,"01:27:47,750","01:27:48,865",Come here.
tt0117060,"01:28:31,134","01:28:32,843",Sir.
tt0117060,"01:28:32,928","01:28:33,924",What's this?
tt0117060,"01:28:34,013","01:28:35,472","Incoming, sir, for you."
tt0117060,"01:28:35,556","01:28:37,965","X-ray's clean, electronics, and no explosives."
tt0117060,"01:28:49,238","01:28:50,483",Gene?
tt0117060,"01:28:55,830","01:28:57,622",How long to the London Terminus?
tt0117060,"01:28:57,707","01:28:58,703","20, 25 minutes."
tt0117060,"01:28:58,792","01:29:00,250",You've got 10 minutes. Move!
tt0117060,"01:29:37,921","01:29:39,084",Yes?
tt0117060,"01:29:39,172","01:29:40,797",<i>Give me Max.</i>
tt0117060,"01:29:40,882","01:29:42,258",It's him.
tt0117060,"01:29:45,888","01:29:47,715",This was not what we discussed.
tt0117060,"01:29:47,807","01:29:50,013","<i>My apologies, Max. It couldn't be helped.</i>"
tt0117060,"01:29:50,101","01:29:52,674",<i>There's a piece of black cloth under your seat.</i>
tt0117060,"01:29:52,770","01:29:54,516","<i>Tear it away, and you'll find the disk.</i>"
tt0117060,"01:30:29,356","01:30:32,606",Dear boy...
tt0117060,"01:30:32,692","01:30:36,276",I hope this doesn't preclude a meeting in private.
tt0117060,"01:30:36,364","01:30:39,615",<i>Not as long as you tell me where the money is.</i>
tt0117060,"01:30:39,701","01:30:41,990",The mere possibility is worth 10 million.
tt0117060,"01:30:42,079","01:30:44,072","Baggage car, rack three."
tt0117060,"01:30:44,165","01:30:48,661","Silver briefcase, combination 314."
tt0117060,"01:30:48,753","01:30:50,295",<i>What about Job?</i>
tt0117060,"01:30:50,380","01:30:51,660",Wouldn't worry about him.
tt0117060,"01:30:51,756","01:30:53,832","When you get the money, he'll find you."
tt0117060,"01:31:11,822","01:31:13,364",What's the matter?
tt0117060,"01:31:13,448","01:31:14,908",It's not transmitting.
tt0117060,"01:31:14,992","01:31:16,736","Try it, try it again!"
tt0117060,"01:31:16,828","01:31:19,449","Damn it, I've got to get this through before we hit the Channel."
tt0117060,"01:31:31,720","01:31:33,842",What's the problem?
tt0117060,"01:31:33,930","01:31:35,094",Connection denied.
tt0117060,"01:31:35,182","01:31:38,219",I can see that. Did you check the batteries?
tt0117060,"01:31:38,310","01:31:40,220",I always do.
tt0117060,"01:31:40,312","01:31:43,896",Don't give me that. Run it through from the top.
tt0117060,"01:31:47,530","01:31:51,148",This is bullshit. We don't even know what Max looks like.
tt0117060,"01:31:51,242","01:31:52,440",We don't need to.
tt0117060,"01:31:52,535","01:31:56,582","If he's got that list, he's going to check it. And that means laptops."
tt0117060,"01:32:08,220","01:32:09,845","Excuse me, sir."
tt0117060,"01:32:09,930","01:32:11,306",Your telephone?
tt0117060,"01:32:11,390","01:32:12,802",Hello?
tt0117060,"01:32:14,561","01:32:16,222",I can't hear anything.
tt0117060,"01:32:17,774","01:32:19,184",Is everything all right?
tt0117060,"01:32:19,275","01:32:20,390",The battery is gone.
tt0117060,"01:32:20,485","01:32:22,062",It's working.
tt0117060,"01:32:34,417","01:32:36,126",He's in the baggage car.
tt0117060,"01:32:37,880","01:32:40,252","Ethan, Kittridge is on the train."
tt0117060,"01:32:40,341","01:32:41,835",<i>I'm right behind you.</i>
tt0117060,"01:32:41,926","01:32:44,797",<i>The money's in the baggage car. I'll meet you there.</i>
tt0117060,"01:33:01,324","01:33:02,569",Barnes?
tt0117060,"01:33:40,703","01:33:42,577",Ethan's right behind me.
tt0117060,"01:33:43,748","01:33:45,575","Listen, Jim..."
tt0117060,"01:33:45,667","01:33:48,586",Is it such a good idea to kill him?
tt0117060,"01:33:51,799","01:33:54,041",Kittridge is here.
tt0117060,"01:33:57,890","01:33:59,848",We take the money...
tt0117060,"01:33:59,934","01:34:02,010",Ethan takes the blame.
tt0117060,"01:34:04,355","01:34:06,894",No one else has seen you alive.
tt0117060,"01:34:09,111","01:34:11,270",No one will believe him.
tt0117060,"01:34:38,896","01:34:40,521",Of course...
tt0117060,"01:34:40,606","01:34:43,477","I'm very sorry to hear you say that, Claire."
tt0117060,"01:34:46,864","01:34:47,860",Ethan...
tt0117060,"01:34:47,949","01:34:48,945",Yes.
tt0117060,"01:34:50,410","01:34:53,494","Ethan Hunt, darling. You remember him, don't you?"
tt0117060,"01:34:55,832","01:34:57,624",You knew about Jim?
tt0117060,"01:34:57,709","01:34:58,908",Of course.
tt0117060,"01:35:00,964","01:35:03,715",Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.
tt0117060,"01:35:03,800","01:35:05,591","Mind telling me, Ethan?"
tt0117060,"01:35:05,677","01:35:09,094",Before or after I showed up in London?
tt0117060,"01:35:10,266","01:35:11,511",Before London.
tt0117060,"01:35:11,600","01:35:14,886",But after you took the Bible from the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
tt0117060,"01:35:15,896","01:35:19,599","They stamped it, didn't they? Those damn Gideons."
tt0117060,"01:35:21,320","01:35:24,903","Ethan... if you knew about Jim, why..."
tt0117060,"01:35:24,991","01:35:26,153",Why the masquerade?
tt0117060,"01:35:26,242","01:35:28,319",Why take the risk?
tt0117060,"01:35:28,412","01:35:30,036","Well, Claire..."
tt0117060,"01:35:30,122","01:35:31,950",you've asked the question.
tt0117060,"01:35:32,041","01:35:34,663",And you are the answer.
tt0117060,"01:35:34,753","01:35:36,959",I knew about Jim.
tt0117060,"01:35:37,046","01:35:39,752",But he didn't know about you.
tt0117060,"01:35:39,842","01:35:41,466","In all fairness, Ethan,"
tt0117060,"01:35:41,552","01:35:45,170",Claire was never convinced her charms would work on you.
tt0117060,"01:35:45,264","01:35:46,806","But I was supremely confident,"
tt0117060,"01:35:46,891","01:35:49,218",having tasted the goods.
tt0117060,"01:35:51,189","01:35:57,192","""Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife"", Ethan."
tt0117060,"01:35:58,113","01:36:00,569",Let's get the money and get out.
tt0117060,"01:36:00,657","01:36:01,820","Yes, let's get the money."
tt0117060,"01:36:03,119","01:36:05,789",Ethan... the money.
tt0117060,"01:36:08,626","01:36:09,824",Give her the money.
tt0117060,"01:36:13,756","01:36:15,167",You've earned it.
tt0117060,"01:36:22,391","01:36:24,051",All ten million.
tt0117060,"01:36:24,185","01:36:28,053","You know, Claire was wrong about one thing, Jim."
tt0117060,"01:36:28,148","01:36:29,940",Oh?
tt0117060,"01:36:30,067","01:36:31,265",What's that?
tt0117060,"01:36:50,383","01:36:52,506","Good morning, Mr Phelps."
tt0117060,"01:36:54,178","01:36:56,420",I'm not the only one who's seen you alive.
tt0117060,"01:36:59,977","01:37:01,934",You son of a bitch.
tt0117060,"01:37:02,020","01:37:03,847","It's over, Jim."
tt0117060,"01:37:10,114","01:37:12,984","Don't... Don't, Jim."
tt0117060,"01:37:13,075","01:37:14,451","""Don't, Jim""?"
tt0117060,"01:40:03,440","01:40:04,436",Aah!
tt0117060,"01:40:24,799","01:40:25,997",Damn!
tt0117060,"01:40:29,387","01:40:31,427","No, it's in the tunnel!"
tt0117060,"01:40:31,682","01:40:34,007","No, no, don't! It'll crash into us!"
tt0117060,"01:40:34,101","01:40:35,643",Accelerate! Accelerate!
tt0117060,"01:42:37,870","01:42:38,949",Red light!
tt0117060,"01:42:40,122","01:42:41,865",Green light!
tt0117060,"01:43:34,478","01:43:36,850",I think this is what you're looking for.
tt0117060,"01:43:43,238","01:43:45,694","Hello, Max."
tt0117060,"01:43:45,783","01:43:48,986",My lawyers are going to have a field day with this.
tt0117060,"01:43:49,078","01:43:51,651","Entrapment, jurisdictional conflict..."
tt0117060,"01:43:51,747","01:43:55,580","Well, maybe we'll just leave the courts out of this one."
tt0117060,"01:43:57,546","01:44:01,379",I'm sure we can find something I have that you need.
tt0117060,"01:44:04,179","01:44:07,548","<i>In a freak accident, a helicopter lost altitude, veered into a tunnel,</i>"
tt0117060,"01:44:07,641","01:44:11,805",<i>and collided with a train on its way from London to Paris.</i>
tt0117060,"01:44:11,895","01:44:15,895","<i>The pilot was killed, but no one on the train was hurt.</i>"
tt0117060,"01:44:15,985","01:44:19,817",<i>Authorities have attributed the accident to instrument failure...</i>
tt0117060,"01:44:19,905","01:44:22,231",Reach your folks? How do they feel?
tt0117060,"01:44:22,324","01:44:23,903",About what?
tt0117060,"01:44:23,994","01:44:26,948","The apology from the Justice Department,"
tt0117060,"01:44:27,038","01:44:30,823","VIP treatment, you know, the whole 9 yards."
tt0117060,"01:44:30,918","01:44:32,958","Well, my mom was a little confused"
tt0117060,"01:44:33,045","01:44:35,798",how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald
tt0117060,"01:44:35,883","01:44:38,504",for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida Keys.
tt0117060,"01:44:41,221","01:44:42,466",Cheers.
tt0117060,"01:44:43,515","01:44:45,889","To you, Luther."
tt0117060,"01:44:45,978","01:44:47,935",For being off the disavowed list.
tt0117060,"01:44:48,022","01:44:50,477","Hey, I'm the flavour of the month."
tt0117060,"01:44:51,984","01:44:54,310",Why don't you come back with me?
tt0117060,"01:44:56,907","01:45:01,036",I just... l just don't know why I'd be doing it.
tt0117060,"01:45:03,372","01:45:05,864",Got to go catch my flight.
tt0117060,"01:45:05,959","01:45:08,711",So how does it feel to be a solid citizen again?
tt0117060,"01:45:11,173","01:45:12,797","Man, I don't know."
tt0117060,"01:45:14,969","01:45:17,544",I'm going to miss being disreputable.
tt0117060,"01:45:17,640","01:45:20,309","Well, Luther, if it makes you feel any better,"
tt0117060,"01:45:20,392","01:45:21,803",I'll always think of you that way.
tt0117060,"01:45:33,574","01:45:35,449",Excuse me. Mr Hunt?
tt0117060,"01:45:36,703","01:45:39,989",Would you like to watch a movie?
tt0117060,"01:45:40,082","01:45:43,996","Oh, uh... no, thank you."
tt0117060,"01:45:44,086","01:45:47,457",Would you consider the cinema of the Caribbean?
tt0117060,"01:45:49,593","01:45:51,502","Aruba, perhaps?"
tt0120755,"00:00:38,622","00:00:40,665","Well, Dmitri."
tt0120755,"00:00:41,166","00:00:43,209",Every search for a hero
tt0120755,"00:00:43,544","00:00:46,879","must begin with something that every hero requires,"
tt0120755,"00:00:48,006","00:00:49,340",a villain.
tt0120755,"00:00:50,134","00:00:54,971","Therefore in a search for our hero, Bellerophon"
tt0120755,"00:00:55,180","00:00:56,973",we created a monster.
tt0120755,"00:00:59,810","00:01:01,060",Chimera.
tt0120755,"00:01:05,524","00:01:08,234","I beg you, Dmitri, come to Sydney"
tt0120755,"00:01:08,318","00:01:11,028",and accompany me to Atlanta immediately.
tt0120755,"00:01:11,321","00:01:12,655","However we travel,"
tt0120755,"00:01:12,740","00:01:16,993",I must arrive at my destination within 20 hours of departure.
tt0120755,"00:01:29,590","00:01:32,133",Ring around the rosie.
tt0120755,"00:01:32,217","00:01:34,927",A pocket full of posies.
tt0120755,"00:01:35,012","00:01:37,930","Ashes, ashes."
tt0120755,"00:01:38,015","00:01:40,558",We all fall down.
tt0120755,"00:01:49,026","00:01:51,527","Folks, we're two and a half hours from Atlanta."
tt0120755,"00:01:51,612","00:01:55,406",Look out your window now. We have a great view of the Rocky Mountains.
tt0120755,"00:01:56,700","00:02:00,912","You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor."
tt0120755,"00:02:01,121","00:02:03,039","Well, yes."
tt0120755,"00:02:03,540","00:02:05,666",I suppose I'm a bit anxious.
tt0120755,"00:02:05,876","00:02:08,211",You'll soon be with old friends.
tt0120755,"00:02:08,504","00:02:11,005","I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri."
tt0120755,"00:02:12,090","00:02:15,134",I'm sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
tt0120755,"00:02:15,219","00:02:16,552",I'm sorry too.
tt0120755,"00:02:17,012","00:02:19,222","You are sorry, and I am sorry."
tt0120755,"00:02:23,060","00:02:25,937",You don't know Gradski thought the world of you.
tt0120755,"00:02:26,230","00:02:27,396",Did he
tt0120755,"00:02:28,398","00:02:29,565",know
tt0120755,"00:02:29,858","00:02:32,401",before the end that you two had succeeded?
tt0120755,"00:02:32,528","00:02:34,904","Yes, he knew. Just."
tt0120755,"00:02:35,906","00:02:37,865",Not in time to save him?
tt0120755,"00:02:38,408","00:02:39,450",No.
tt0120755,"00:02:40,077","00:02:43,621",After you've been infected with Chimera for 20 hours
tt0120755,"00:02:43,747","00:02:45,456",nothing can save you
tt0120755,"00:02:45,916","00:02:47,708",not even Bellerophon.
tt0120755,"00:02:48,919","00:02:50,962",You can carry them together
tt0120755,"00:02:52,589","00:02:53,714",safely?
tt0120755,"00:02:53,799","00:02:54,924",Yes.
tt0120755,"00:02:55,926","00:02:59,929","And you'll get us to safe place with them in Atlanta, thank God."
tt0120755,"00:03:01,431","00:03:02,640",This is your Captain again.
tt0120755,"00:03:02,766","00:03:06,310",We've experienced a slight but abrupt drop in cabin pressure.
tt0120755,"00:03:06,436","00:03:09,063","As a precaution, I've released the oxygen masks."
tt0120755,"00:03:09,147","00:03:12,275","Please put them on, sit back, relax."
tt0120755,"00:03:12,401","00:03:14,652",There's nothing to worry about.
tt0120755,"00:03:17,573","00:03:18,948",Are you concerned?
tt0120755,"00:03:19,741","00:03:21,284",Not so far.
tt0120755,"00:03:21,660","00:03:23,119",Just put on your oxygen mask.
tt0120755,"00:03:23,245","00:03:25,580",- I'll see what's going on. - Okay.
tt0120755,"00:03:32,629","00:03:36,966","Denver Centre, this is Transpac 2207, 747 heavy."
tt0120755,"00:03:37,926","00:03:40,094",We're unable to maintain cabin pressurisation.
tt0120755,"00:03:40,178","00:03:43,472",We've initiated a descent to 1-6000.
tt0120755,"00:03:44,433","00:03:45,975",Captain...
tt0120755,"00:04:13,795","00:04:14,879",God.
tt0120755,"00:04:26,808","00:04:29,352","It seems we have a problem, Dmitri."
tt0120755,"00:04:29,686","00:04:31,812",You keep calling me Dmitri.
tt0120755,"00:04:33,023","00:04:34,857",You really shouldn't.
tt0120755,"00:04:35,484","00:04:37,485",You are not Dmitri?
tt0120755,"00:04:50,832","00:04:51,874",No.
tt0120755,"00:04:54,169","00:04:55,336","Wallis,"
tt0120755,"00:04:55,712","00:04:57,338",hold on to this.
tt0120755,"00:05:08,058","00:05:10,393","Ulrich, remember to pull the..."
tt0120755,"00:05:13,563","00:05:16,315",Remember to pull the NO2 tank and dump it.
tt0120755,"00:05:16,400","00:05:18,025","All done, chief."
tt0120755,"00:05:21,196","00:05:23,030",Terrain. Terrain.
tt0120755,"00:05:23,156","00:05:26,158",Pull up. Pull up. Terrain.
tt0120755,"00:05:30,580","00:05:32,498",Seven nine nine!

tt0120755,"00:05:35,585","00:05:37,044",Go!
tt0120755,"00:05:44,177","00:05:45,845",Terrain. Terrain.
tt0120755,"00:05:45,929","00:05:47,722",Pull up. Pull up.

tt0120755,"00:05:49,766","00:05:52,059",Pull up. Pull up.
tt0120755,"00:09:17,557","00:09:18,933","Good morning, Mr Hunt."
tt0120755,"00:09:19,017","00:09:20,851","Your mission, should you choose to accept it"
tt0120755,"00:09:20,936","00:09:23,270",involves the recovery of a stolen item
tt0120755,"00:09:23,355","00:09:24,980",designated Chimera.
tt0120755,"00:09:25,065","00:09:27,650",You may select any two team members but it is essential
tt0120755,"00:09:27,734","00:09:31,195",that the third team member be Nyah Nordoff-Hall.
tt0120755,"00:09:31,279","00:09:32,863",She is a civilian
tt0120755,"00:09:32,948","00:09:35,407",and a highly capable professional thief.
tt0120755,"00:09:35,492","00:09:38,160",You have 48 hours to recruit Miss Nordoff-Hall
tt0120755,"00:09:38,245","00:09:40,955",and meet me in Seville to receive your assignment.
tt0120755,"00:09:41,039","00:09:44,541","As always, should you or any member of your IMF team be caught or killed"
tt0120755,"00:09:44,626","00:09:48,212",the Secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions.
tt0120755,"00:09:48,463","00:09:50,965","And, Mr Hunt, the next time you go on holiday"
tt0120755,"00:09:51,049","00:09:54,134",please let us know where you're going.
tt0120755,"00:09:54,219","00:09:57,263",This message will self-destruct in five seconds.
tt0120755,"00:09:57,347","00:09:59,723",If I let you know where I'm going
tt0120755,"00:10:00,350","00:10:02,559",then I won't be on holiday.
tt0120755,"00:13:37,817","00:13:39,568",I see you found it.
tt0120755,"00:13:43,031","00:13:44,490",What are you doing here?
tt0120755,"00:13:44,574","00:13:47,159",Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
tt0120755,"00:13:49,370","00:13:51,580",Not just a pretty face after all.
tt0120755,"00:14:09,599","00:14:11,600",Do you mind if I'm on top?
tt0120755,"00:14:12,685","00:14:15,020",Either way works for me.
tt0120755,"00:14:39,504","00:14:42,464",- You'll never find it there. - Damn it.
tt0120755,"00:14:44,884","00:14:47,135",- Find what? - His ex's Bulgari necklace.
tt0120755,"00:14:47,220","00:14:49,638",It goes up for auction on Tuesday.
tt0120755,"00:14:53,893","00:14:56,979",And are you going to tell me where it is?
tt0120755,"00:14:59,148","00:15:00,399",Far left.
tt0120755,"00:15:12,495","00:15:14,830",This is very disconcerting.
tt0120755,"00:15:15,415","00:15:18,542","Hey, you put me here. I just do as I'm told."
tt0120755,"00:15:19,586","00:15:20,752",Right.
tt0120755,"00:15:46,779","00:15:48,030",Now
tt0120755,"00:15:48,865","00:15:52,117",who are you and what's it gonna cost me?
tt0120755,"00:15:52,702","00:15:54,202",I wouldn't do that.
tt0120755,"00:15:54,454","00:15:55,537",What?
tt0120755,"00:15:57,373","00:15:58,373",That.
tt0120755,"00:16:08,092","00:16:09,885","Mr Keys, it is you."
tt0120755,"00:16:09,969","00:16:13,055","It is Mr Keys, our security engineer. Apologise!"
tt0120755,"00:16:13,139","00:16:15,140","No, no need to apologise."
tt0120755,"00:16:15,725","00:16:18,977","Miss Hall, my associate, has your necklace in a very safe place"
tt0120755,"00:16:19,062","00:16:22,689",but obviously we do feel the alarm should have gone off a little sooner.
tt0120755,"00:16:22,774","00:16:24,733","Isn't that right, Miss Hall?"
tt0120755,"00:16:24,901","00:16:28,403","Oh, absolutely. Much, much too long, I'd say."
tt0120755,"00:16:31,240","00:16:35,911",We'd recommend resetting the sensors to respond to a lighter load.
tt0120755,"00:16:36,079","00:16:38,914","How do you feel about 40 kilos, Miss Hall?"
tt0120755,"00:16:39,082","00:16:40,290",Perfect.
tt0120755,"00:16:42,502","00:16:43,752",Shall we?
tt0120755,"00:16:47,090","00:16:48,590","Miss Hall,"
tt0120755,"00:16:49,926","00:16:52,260",haven't you forgotten something?
tt0120755,"00:16:56,808","00:17:00,477","What are you trying to do, senorita, rob me?"
tt0120755,"00:17:00,645","00:17:02,979",The thought had crossed my mind.
tt0120755,"00:17:04,857","00:17:07,984","I'm missing something here, aside from my half million pound necklace."
tt0120755,"00:17:08,111","00:17:10,821","Even after I screwed up the job, I could have walked out with the thing."
tt0120755,"00:17:10,947","00:17:11,988",At least you walked.
tt0120755,"00:17:12,115","00:17:14,991","If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you watch me do it?"
tt0120755,"00:17:15,118","00:17:16,368",I wanted to see how good you were.
tt0120755,"00:17:16,452","00:17:18,829",I was hoping we might work together.
tt0120755,"00:17:18,955","00:17:20,497",Sounds terrific.
tt0120755,"00:17:24,961","00:17:27,212","Now be serious. Whatever you're talking about,"
tt0120755,"00:17:27,296","00:17:29,047",you couldn't want me after that performance.
tt0120755,"00:17:29,132","00:17:32,467",- You didn't do that badly. - You apologising for me?
tt0120755,"00:17:33,052","00:17:34,803",Quite the gentleman.
tt0120755,"00:17:35,138","00:17:36,471",Not really.
tt0120755,"00:17:37,640","00:17:39,474",I triggered the alarm.
tt0120755,"00:17:42,979","00:17:44,479",Sorry.
tt0120755,"00:17:48,901","00:17:51,319","I don't do laundry, cook"
tt0120755,"00:17:51,654","00:17:54,072",or put up with cheeky bastards who set me up on their territory
tt0120755,"00:17:54,157","00:17:55,866",so they can poach on mine.
tt0120755,"00:18:20,349","00:18:22,517",- Hello. - Hi.
tt0120755,"00:18:22,935","00:18:25,061",Would you mind slowing down?
tt0120755,"00:18:27,774","00:18:30,692",Where did you get this number? I don't even have it.
tt0120755,"00:18:32,695","00:18:34,029",Would you like it?
tt0120755,"00:18:53,257","00:18:55,967","Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen."
tt0120755,"00:18:56,052","00:18:58,804",- Listen to what? - I need your help.
tt0120755,"00:18:58,888","00:19:01,973",- I think you could use mine. - Your help?
tt0120755,"00:19:02,058","00:19:03,433",What are you talking about?
tt0120755,"00:19:03,559","00:19:06,394","I'm talking about Scotland Yard, interpol"
tt0120755,"00:19:06,562","00:19:08,396",every Dutch authority.
tt0120755,"00:19:09,232","00:19:11,149",I can make them all go away.
tt0120755,"00:19:11,234","00:19:12,818","Oh, bloody hell."
tt0120755,"00:19:12,902","00:19:14,402",You're a spy!
tt0120755,"00:19:14,779","00:19:17,739","Well, if you want me, you've gotta catch me."
tt0120755,"00:19:39,762","00:19:41,471",You having fun?
tt0120755,"00:19:54,610","00:19:56,210",Sorry.
tt0120755,"00:20:05,830","00:20:07,539",Watch the road.
tt0120755,"00:21:11,896","00:21:13,521",What's your name?
tt0120755,"00:21:15,358","00:21:16,691",Ethan Hunt.
tt0120755,"00:21:17,860","00:21:19,444","Well, Ethan Hunt"
tt0120755,"00:21:21,197","00:21:23,949",what is it you want to talk to me about?
tt0120755,"00:21:24,909","00:21:26,952",A lot more than I thought.
tt0120755,"00:21:30,581","00:21:32,540",Awfully short notice.
tt0120755,"00:21:33,292","00:21:35,585",Care to wait a decent interval?
tt0120755,"00:21:36,295","00:21:38,129",Who wants to be decent?
tt0120755,"00:22:35,604","00:22:38,106",So what have you got against spies?
tt0120755,"00:22:38,649","00:22:41,276",When they've got your recruiting technique
tt0120755,"00:22:41,360","00:22:42,819",nothing.
tt0120755,"00:22:44,321","00:22:47,866",- This wasn't exactly by the book. - They've got a book for this?
tt0120755,"00:22:47,950","00:22:50,368",They've got a book for everything.
tt0120755,"00:22:51,620","00:22:54,039",So this thing these blokes pinched...
tt0120755,"00:22:54,290","00:22:56,791",I don't know that they pinched it.
tt0120755,"00:22:57,043","00:22:59,669",I don't even know that they're blokes.
tt0120755,"00:23:01,338","00:23:03,214",What am I doing here?
tt0120755,"00:23:04,717","00:23:09,387",I thought I was supposed to be some kind of thief to catch a thief.
tt0120755,"00:23:09,680","00:23:11,139",So did I.
tt0120755,"00:23:12,641","00:23:13,850",Sort of.
tt0120755,"00:23:21,525","00:23:23,526","Damn, you're beautiful."
tt0120755,"00:24:38,227","00:24:39,811",Espresso? Cappuccino?
tt0120755,"00:24:39,895","00:24:41,396","No, thanks."
tt0120755,"00:24:42,148","00:24:43,398",Sit down.
tt0120755,"00:24:44,733","00:24:46,276",Festival's a pain in the ass.
tt0120755,"00:24:46,402","00:24:48,695",Honouring their saints by setting them on fire.
tt0120755,"00:24:48,779","00:24:51,072","Lets you know what they think of saints, doesn't it?"
tt0120755,"00:24:51,157","00:24:54,075",Damn near set me on fire on my way over here.
tt0120755,"00:24:56,579","00:24:58,746","Sorry, I barged in on your vacation."
tt0120755,"00:24:58,831","00:25:02,917",- Sorry I didn't tell you where I was. - Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
tt0120755,"00:25:03,002","00:25:05,420","Well, you're sorry, and I'm sorry."
tt0120755,"00:25:07,590","00:25:10,925",- Why did you phrase it like that? - Like what?
tt0120755,"00:25:11,260","00:25:13,261","""You're sorry. I'm sorry."""
tt0120755,"00:25:14,763","00:25:16,306",You gotta be kidding.
tt0120755,"00:25:23,772","00:25:25,106","Well, Dmitri"
tt0120755,"00:25:25,774","00:25:27,775",once again I need your help
tt0120755,"00:25:27,860","00:25:30,028","just as in the old days, huh?"
tt0120755,"00:25:30,487","00:25:34,199","When you saved our lives, saved our very sanity."
tt0120755,"00:25:38,287","00:25:41,289",We have this little problem.
tt0120755,"00:25:42,958","00:25:44,876",Every search for a hero
tt0120755,"00:25:45,544","00:25:48,796","must begin with something that every hero requires,"
tt0120755,"00:25:48,881","00:25:50,215",a villain.
tt0120755,"00:25:50,966","00:25:55,303","Therefore in a search for our hero, Bellerophon"
tt0120755,"00:25:56,013","00:25:58,139",we created a monster.
tt0120755,"00:25:58,724","00:25:59,974",Chimera.
tt0120755,"00:26:01,143","00:26:04,187","I beg you, Dmitri, come to Sydney"
tt0120755,"00:26:04,313","00:26:07,732",and accompany me to Atlanta immediately.
tt0120755,"00:26:08,192","00:26:09,817","However we travel,"
tt0120755,"00:26:09,985","00:26:14,489",I must arrive at my destination within 20 hours of departure.
tt0120755,"00:26:15,658","00:26:19,661",I fear I can entrust this to no one but you.
tt0120755,"00:26:22,164","00:26:26,167","As we say, I'm sorry, and you are sorry."
tt0120755,"00:26:26,669","00:26:28,962",Do you have any idea what the hell he's talking about?
tt0120755,"00:26:29,046","00:26:30,672",An idea? Yeah.
tt0120755,"00:26:31,006","00:26:33,675",- Like? - It's a good idea to get him now.
tt0120755,"00:26:34,009","00:26:38,179",A bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier. Is he still in Sydney?
tt0120755,"00:26:38,681","00:26:41,015",Dr Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.
tt0120755,"00:26:42,726","00:26:46,187","So is his colleague Gradski, but that happened earlier."
tt0120755,"00:26:46,522","00:26:48,731",We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney
tt0120755,"00:26:48,857","00:26:50,942",that crashed in the Rockies.
tt0120755,"00:26:51,360","00:26:52,527",Dead.
tt0120755,"00:26:52,736","00:26:54,696",Are you listening to me?
tt0120755,"00:26:56,282","00:26:59,200",If he didn't want to go anywhere without me
tt0120755,"00:27:00,452","00:27:02,537",how did you get him on that flight?
tt0120755,"00:27:02,621","00:27:04,205",You were there.
tt0120755,"00:27:11,755","00:27:14,215","When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you."
tt0120755,"00:27:14,300","00:27:16,634",Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice.
tt0120755,"00:27:16,719","00:27:19,137",He doubled you two or three times.
tt0120755,"00:27:21,890","00:27:24,100",- Twice. - What did you think of him?
tt0120755,"00:27:27,563","00:27:31,691",We had reservations about each other. It's a bit late to be asking me that.
tt0120755,"00:27:31,775","00:27:33,401","No, not necessarily."
tt0120755,"00:27:33,485","00:27:35,069",Airline records
tt0120755,"00:27:36,071","00:27:39,824",list a Captain Harold Macintosh as the pilot of flight 2207.
tt0120755,"00:27:40,326","00:27:43,786",As far as the media and all the governmental agencies are concerned.
tt0120755,"00:27:43,912","00:27:46,456",Captain Macintosh died in the flight.
tt0120755,"00:27:46,749","00:27:48,499","But, in fact, he missed it."
tt0120755,"00:27:49,251","00:27:51,669","He did, however, make the next flight"
tt0120755,"00:27:51,962","00:27:53,254",in cargo
tt0120755,"00:27:53,922","00:27:57,592","stuffed into a rather small suitcase, considering his size."
tt0120755,"00:27:58,594","00:28:01,220",Someone on that flight planned an operation
tt0120755,"00:28:01,305","00:28:03,723",designed to bring the plane down and make it look like an accident.
tt0120755,"00:28:03,807","00:28:06,934",Someone skillful enough to bring it off without a hitch.
tt0120755,"00:28:08,270","00:28:11,356",There's one thing we know that Ambrose doesn't.
tt0120755,"00:28:11,440","00:28:14,942",Then you do think it was Ambrose? You're not surprised?
tt0120755,"00:28:15,444","00:28:16,861",Sean feels he hasn't done the job
tt0120755,"00:28:16,945","00:28:18,863",unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
tt0120755,"00:28:18,947","00:28:20,490",The question is why.
tt0120755,"00:28:20,616","00:28:23,618",What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
tt0120755,"00:28:24,828","00:28:26,537",Only Ambrose knows that.
tt0120755,"00:28:27,289","00:28:30,833","In any case, you must recover this Chimera"
tt0120755,"00:28:30,959","00:28:32,627",and bring it to us.
tt0120755,"00:28:33,837","00:28:37,298","In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money on it."
tt0120755,"00:28:37,383","00:28:39,467",That is where Miss Hall comes in.
tt0120755,"00:28:44,139","00:28:45,473",Excuse me?
tt0120755,"00:28:46,141","00:28:48,267",Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship
tt0120755,"00:28:48,352","00:28:49,602",which he took very seriously.
tt0120755,"00:28:49,686","00:28:52,688","She walked away, and he's been wanting her back ever since."
tt0120755,"00:28:52,815","00:28:55,983",We believe she's our surest and quickest way of locating him.
tt0120755,"00:28:56,068","00:28:57,568",And then what?
tt0120755,"00:28:58,404","00:29:00,488","Well, make sure she continues to see him"
tt0120755,"00:29:00,572","00:29:03,533","gets him to confide in her, and report to you."
tt0120755,"00:29:18,340","00:29:21,008",You made it sound as if I was recruiting her
tt0120755,"00:29:21,093","00:29:23,094",for her skills as a thief.
tt0120755,"00:29:23,929","00:29:27,306","Well, then I misled you or you made the wrong assumption."
tt0120755,"00:29:27,391","00:29:31,060","Either way, we are asking her to resume a prior relationship"
tt0120755,"00:29:31,186","00:29:33,479",not do anything she hasn't already done.
tt0120755,"00:29:33,564","00:29:35,523","Voluntarily, I might add."
tt0120755,"00:29:38,110","00:29:41,362","No, she's got no training for this kind of thing."
tt0120755,"00:29:41,864","00:29:43,364",To go to bed with a man and lie to him?
tt0120755,"00:29:43,449","00:29:46,367",She's a woman. She's got all the training she needs.
tt0120755,"00:29:52,374","00:29:54,917",I don't think I can get her to do it.
tt0120755,"00:29:55,043","00:29:57,086",- You mean it'll be difficult. - Very.
tt0120755,"00:29:57,212","00:30:00,548","Well, this is not Mission: Difficult, Mr Hunt. It's Mission: Impossible."
tt0120755,"00:30:00,632","00:30:02,508",Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.
tt0120755,"00:30:02,593","00:30:04,051",I'm open to suggestion.
tt0120755,"00:30:04,136","00:30:06,053",If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose
tt0120755,"00:30:06,138","00:30:07,346",you're welcome to try.
tt0120755,"00:30:07,431","00:30:08,723",You might want to take a look at these
tt0120755,"00:30:08,807","00:30:12,310",if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
tt0120755,"00:31:10,327","00:31:13,996",How many people are capable of something like that?
tt0120755,"00:31:17,960","00:31:19,502",Sean Ambrose
tt0120755,"00:31:19,878","00:31:21,128",for one.
tt0120755,"00:31:27,803","00:31:28,970",Right.
tt0120755,"00:31:39,648","00:31:42,316","This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah."
tt0120755,"00:31:46,488","00:31:48,990",But it is what you'd like me to do.
tt0120755,"00:31:53,328","00:31:54,412",What?
tt0120755,"00:31:54,496","00:31:57,373","Oh, let my conscience be my guide. Is that it?"
tt0120755,"00:31:57,499","00:31:58,541",Something like that.
tt0120755,"00:31:58,667","00:32:01,252",I don't have a conscience. I'm a bloody thief.
tt0120755,"00:32:05,591","00:32:07,842",You're gonna try and force me to do this?
tt0120755,"00:32:07,926","00:32:09,969","Generally, I don't favour coercing someone"
tt0120755,"00:32:10,053","00:32:13,514",not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
tt0120755,"00:32:13,932","00:32:15,683",Is that the only reason?
tt0120755,"00:32:16,059","00:32:18,352",- Can you think of a better one? - Me? No.
tt0120755,"00:32:18,437","00:32:21,063","I was hoping you might, thinking that somewhere in the course of business"
tt0120755,"00:32:21,189","00:32:23,357",this got personal as well as physical!
tt0120755,"00:32:23,442","00:32:26,402",Okay. Would it make you feel any better if I didn't want you to do this?
tt0120755,"00:32:26,528","00:32:28,696","- Yeah, much. - Then feel better!"
tt0120755,"00:33:06,485","00:33:09,362",Sean will never be anything but suspicious if I pitch up
tt0120755,"00:33:09,446","00:33:11,739","saying, ""Hey, honey, I'm home."""
tt0120755,"00:33:13,408","00:33:15,201",What wouldn't make him suspicious?
tt0120755,"00:33:15,285","00:33:17,912",That I needed him in some urgent way.
tt0120755,"00:33:19,915","00:33:21,207","Destitute,"
tt0120755,"00:33:21,291","00:33:23,000","in serious trouble,"
tt0120755,"00:33:23,085","00:33:26,003",the kind I couldn't possibly sort out myself.
tt0120755,"00:33:26,922","00:33:28,756","Serious trouble, Nyah"
tt0120755,"00:33:29,758","00:33:32,134",is something I can always arrange.
tt0120755,"00:33:36,139","00:33:39,392",This transponder chip is completely untraceable.
tt0120755,"00:33:40,852","00:33:43,604",It transmits your location to a satellite
tt0120755,"00:33:43,814","00:33:46,524",which can be read by only this computer.
tt0120755,"00:33:47,109","00:33:49,777",We can then track you to within three feet
tt0120755,"00:33:49,861","00:33:50,945",anywhere.
tt0120755,"00:33:53,782","00:33:55,616","Since your arrest, I've been sending news bulletins"
tt0120755,"00:33:55,701","00:33:58,494",to every law enforcement agency in the world.
tt0120755,"00:33:58,578","00:34:00,287",I know Sean Ambrose
tt0120755,"00:34:01,289","00:34:03,874",and I guarantee that after that airline crash
tt0120755,"00:34:04,459","00:34:06,627",he's monitoring every one of them.
tt0120755,"00:34:07,170","00:34:08,796",He knows you're there.
tt0120755,"00:34:10,424","00:34:12,967",And he has the means to get you out.
tt0120755,"00:34:22,811","00:34:24,687",I'm not gonna lose you.
tt0120755,"00:35:23,622","00:35:24,872",Agent Hunt?
tt0120755,"00:35:24,956","00:35:26,916","Good day, mate. I'm William Baird, but Billy's okay."
tt0120755,"00:35:27,000","00:35:29,460","Anything you need me to get, move or watch, I'm your man."
tt0120755,"00:35:29,544","00:35:31,212",I'll have a look around.
tt0120755,"00:35:36,009","00:35:37,092",Shit.
tt0120755,"00:35:37,219","00:35:38,552","Yes, it is."
tt0120755,"00:35:40,555","00:35:42,223",This ain't funny.
tt0120755,"00:35:43,058","00:35:45,935",I just bought these $800 Gucci shoes
tt0120755,"00:35:46,019","00:35:48,938",and you got me in a helicopter with this man?
tt0120755,"00:36:23,682","00:36:25,808",Computer's up. We got her.
tt0120755,"00:36:26,935","00:36:29,562",Let's put in the coordinates and get a visual.
tt0120755,"00:36:56,298","00:37:00,175",- Visuals aren't coming up. - Satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.
tt0120755,"00:37:00,260","00:37:02,511","Yeah, I heard about you, Luther."
tt0120755,"00:37:02,596","00:37:06,932",I wanna say it's an honour and a pleasure to be working with you blokes.
tt0120755,"00:37:10,729","00:37:13,480",Isn't there any way we can speed this up?
tt0120755,"00:37:13,565","00:37:17,026",With what? This is the only computer that will do this.
tt0120755,"00:38:15,502","00:38:17,211","Ethan, here we go."
tt0120755,"00:38:27,973","00:38:31,475",Now there's a bloke who knows how to give a proper welcome.
tt0120755,"00:38:33,186","00:38:36,605","Don't get me wrong, mate. You were very friendly also."
tt0120755,"00:38:38,191","00:38:39,483",Is it him then?
tt0120755,"00:38:39,651","00:38:41,443","- It's him, Billy. - So we got him."
tt0120755,"00:38:41,528","00:38:43,362",We don't know what we've got.
tt0120755,"00:38:43,446","00:38:45,531",'Cause we don't know what he's got
tt0120755,"00:38:45,615","00:38:48,826",where he's got it or what he's doing in Sydney with it.
tt0120755,"00:38:56,209","00:38:57,876",Not much luggage.
tt0120755,"00:38:58,294","00:39:00,170",I left in a bit of a hurry.
tt0120755,"00:39:00,463","00:39:02,715","I'm incredibly grateful, Sean."
tt0120755,"00:39:03,758","00:39:06,135",How in the world did you find me?
tt0120755,"00:39:07,971","00:39:10,139",How I usually find you.
tt0120755,"00:39:11,391","00:39:12,725",Magic.
tt0120755,"00:39:31,828","00:39:33,162",No flies on her.
tt0120755,"00:39:33,663","00:39:37,374",No bugs either. No transmissions. She's clean.
tt0120755,"00:39:38,418","00:39:39,877",All cats are.
tt0120755,"00:39:47,927","00:39:49,261",Your room?
tt0120755,"00:39:53,850","00:39:55,225",And my room?
tt0120755,"00:40:12,619","00:40:13,911",She did it.
tt0120755,"00:40:14,829","00:40:16,455",She's in the compound.
tt0120755,"00:40:17,415","00:40:18,499",Yeah?
tt0120755,"00:40:19,626","00:40:23,170",We've just rolled up a snowball and tossed it into hell.
tt0120755,"00:40:23,838","00:40:26,215",Now we'll see what chance it has.
tt0120755,"00:40:28,218","00:40:29,551",Try it on.
tt0120755,"00:40:33,473","00:40:34,723",Go ahead.
tt0120755,"00:40:42,023","00:40:44,858",I'm dying to see if I remembered your size.
tt0120755,"00:41:14,347","00:41:17,266",You're not interested in seeing how it looks?
tt0120755,"00:41:18,268","00:41:19,601","Oh, I am."
tt0120755,"00:41:22,856","00:41:24,022",Later.
tt0120755,"00:41:47,797","00:41:49,965",Every search for a hero
tt0120755,"00:41:50,091","00:41:53,385","must begin with something that every hero requires,"
tt0120755,"00:41:53,469","00:41:54,803",a villain.
tt0120755,"00:41:55,388","00:41:59,641","Therefore in a search for our hero, Bellerophon"
tt0120755,"00:42:00,393","00:42:02,603",we created a monster.
tt0120755,"00:42:02,937","00:42:04,188",Chimera.
tt0120755,"00:42:04,355","00:42:06,440",Nekhorvich was a molecular biologist.
tt0120755,"00:42:06,524","00:42:09,359",Why is he going on about an old Greek myth?
tt0120755,"00:42:09,485","00:42:12,779",Nekhorvich specialised in recombining DNA molecules.
tt0120755,"00:42:14,616","00:42:15,991",In the myth.
tt0120755,"00:42:16,409","00:42:19,453","Bellerophon was a prince who killed the Chimera,"
tt0120755,"00:42:20,788","00:42:23,207",a monster with the head of a lion
tt0120755,"00:42:23,958","00:42:26,335",and the tail of a serpent
tt0120755,"00:42:27,170","00:42:29,421",who plagued the ancient world.
tt0120755,"00:42:30,548","00:42:33,967",I think Nekhorvich created a monster virus in Chimera
tt0120755,"00:42:34,719","00:42:36,762",and the antivirus to kill it
tt0120755,"00:42:36,846","00:42:38,639",in Bellerophon.
tt0120755,"00:42:40,058","00:42:41,683","That simple, huh?"
tt0120755,"00:42:44,020","00:42:45,270",Why not?
tt0120755,"00:43:03,665","00:43:05,832",Thirty-seven million pounds.
tt0120755,"00:43:07,085","00:43:10,003","Well, that's a promising bid for Nekhorvich's work."
tt0120755,"00:43:12,090","00:43:15,676","Don't look so worried, Hugh. We're halfway there."
tt0120755,"00:43:19,097","00:43:21,223",We'll need this at the track
tt0120755,"00:43:22,850","00:43:25,185",if we're going to get the other half.
tt0120755,"00:43:34,570","00:43:35,946","Well, then..."
tt0120755,"00:43:37,740","00:43:38,949",Sorted.
tt0120755,"00:43:45,540","00:43:47,040",Not everything.
tt0120755,"00:43:49,460","00:43:51,628",Why do you think she's really here?
tt0120755,"00:43:54,132","00:43:56,216",From her point of view or mine?
tt0120755,"00:43:56,467","00:43:58,677",She wasn't exactly gagging for it
tt0120755,"00:43:58,761","00:44:01,221",when she left you six months ago.
tt0120755,"00:44:04,100","00:44:06,643","The question is, ""Do you trust her?"""
tt0120755,"00:44:14,986","00:44:17,279","One considers her timing, of course."
tt0120755,"00:44:17,405","00:44:20,407",Getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.
tt0120755,"00:44:20,491","00:44:21,825",Suggestive
tt0120755,"00:44:22,744","00:44:24,745",even borderline suspicious
tt0120755,"00:44:25,913","00:44:27,748",but hardly conclusive.
tt0120755,"00:44:33,921","00:44:36,423",You've thought about it at any rate.
tt0120755,"00:44:41,429","00:44:42,929","Tell me, Hugh."
tt0120755,"00:44:43,765","00:44:47,976","You don't exactly hang on Nyah's every word and gesture, do you?"
tt0120755,"00:44:51,606","00:44:53,607",That's a fairly ratty nail.
tt0120755,"00:44:59,238","00:45:00,405","Don't, please."
tt0120755,"00:45:00,490","00:45:04,576",Suppose she is some sort of Trojan horse sent in by IMF
tt0120755,"00:45:04,660","00:45:05,952",to spy on us?
tt0120755,"00:45:06,079","00:45:09,790",Why should I deny myself the pleasure of a ride or two?
tt0120755,"00:45:11,459","00:45:14,878",Or don't you think I can learn more from her than she can from me?
tt0120755,"00:45:14,962","00:45:17,964",I do! I do! I do!
tt0120755,"00:45:19,842","00:45:22,761","Now, Hugh, you must realise"
tt0120755,"00:45:22,845","00:45:26,473",that some of us have the burden of sex to deal with.
tt0120755,"00:45:26,766","00:45:29,935",And I may or may not know why she thinks she's here
tt0120755,"00:45:30,103","00:45:32,062",but I'm willing to take the risk
tt0120755,"00:45:32,146","00:45:33,814","because, Hugh"
tt0120755,"00:45:35,858","00:45:37,984",I am gagging for it.
tt0120755,"00:46:01,008","00:46:04,010",Come on! Come on!
tt0120755,"00:46:05,805","00:46:08,640","Darling, you won!"
tt0120755,"00:46:08,808","00:46:10,350",I suppose I did.
tt0120755,"00:46:10,518","00:46:12,394",What made you pick that nag?
tt0120755,"00:46:12,520","00:46:14,479",She's never won a bloody thing.
tt0120755,"00:46:14,564","00:46:16,148","""Thief in the Night."""
tt0120755,"00:46:16,899","00:46:18,525",Say no more.
tt0120755,"00:46:21,529","00:46:23,363",I'm off to grab a drink.
tt0120755,"00:46:23,489","00:46:25,657",You still favour the Bellinis?
tt0120755,"00:46:42,884","00:46:44,384",Naturally Vain.
tt0120755,"00:46:46,220","00:46:47,554",Pardon me?
tt0120755,"00:46:47,680","00:46:49,222",Naturally Vain?
tt0120755,"00:46:50,725","00:46:54,060",In the fourth. Check her out. She's due.
tt0120755,"00:47:07,825","00:47:10,744",You can speak as if I'm right by your side.
tt0120755,"00:47:10,870","00:47:12,996",Where are you?
tt0120755,"00:47:13,080","00:47:15,749","Mounting enclosure, just off the track, 2:00."
tt0120755,"00:47:31,098","00:47:32,599",How's it going?
tt0120755,"00:47:33,559","00:47:35,352",Just like old times.
tt0120755,"00:47:37,063","00:47:38,855",Just like old times?
tt0120755,"00:47:39,857","00:47:41,191",Just about.
tt0120755,"00:47:44,111","00:47:46,863",Tell me who you've run into at Ambrose's.
tt0120755,"00:47:47,406","00:47:51,701","Near as I can tell, there's about a half dozen blokes about the place."
tt0120755,"00:47:51,786","00:47:53,036",Maybe more.
tt0120755,"00:47:53,120","00:47:55,121",Hugh Stamp. Old friend of Sean's.
tt0120755,"00:47:55,248","00:47:57,290",He's the only one I recognise.
tt0120755,"00:47:57,375","00:47:59,209",A creep and then some.
tt0120755,"00:47:59,377","00:48:03,046",We know him. He's over your left shoulder looking at you right now.
tt0120755,"00:48:04,840","00:48:08,677",Ambrose has photos of newspapers with money piled on them.
tt0120755,"00:48:08,803","00:48:11,096",Thirty-seven million on the London Times.
tt0120755,"00:48:11,180","00:48:12,847",What's that about?
tt0120755,"00:48:14,725","00:48:16,893",Bids from possible Chimera buyers.
tt0120755,"00:48:27,738","00:48:30,532",Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar.
tt0120755,"00:48:30,616","00:48:34,286",Big bloke. Ginger hair. They're into something.
tt0120755,"00:48:40,876","00:48:43,545","- Who is this guy? - Checking now, Ethan."
tt0120755,"00:48:50,845","00:48:54,264","John McCloy, CEO Biocyte Pharmaceuticals,"
tt0120755,"00:48:54,348","00:48:57,350","1989, acquired Biocyte in a hostile takeover."
tt0120755,"00:48:59,979","00:49:02,105",- He was Nekhorvich's boss. - Right.
tt0120755,"00:49:02,189","00:49:05,233",He worked for him as the research scientist at Biocyte.
tt0120755,"00:49:06,569","00:49:09,904",Ambrose is showing something to McCloy on a digital camera.
tt0120755,"00:49:10,573","00:49:14,034","Whatever McCloy's looking at, he's not happy about it."
tt0120755,"00:49:24,670","00:49:26,963",Ambrose just pulled the camera's memory card
tt0120755,"00:49:27,048","00:49:28,882",and put it into an envelope.
tt0120755,"00:49:30,843","00:49:33,053",Put it in his inner left jacket pocket.
tt0120755,"00:49:33,137","00:49:35,221",Confirm left jacket pocket.
tt0120755,"00:49:36,599","00:49:37,932",Roger that.
tt0120755,"00:49:40,811","00:49:41,895","Nyah,"
tt0120755,"00:49:42,605","00:49:44,522",Ambrose is on his way back to you.
tt0120755,"00:49:44,607","00:49:47,901",- There's an envelope inside... - His left jacket pocket.
tt0120755,"00:49:48,611","00:49:49,903",That's right.
tt0120755,"00:49:49,987","00:49:51,237",Where do I meet you?
tt0120755,"00:49:51,322","00:49:53,615","Betting table 12, off the paddock."
tt0120755,"00:49:53,699","00:49:57,118",- Are you sure you're up to this? - I'll muddle through.
tt0120755,"00:49:58,454","00:50:00,955",- There you are. - See anything you like?
tt0120755,"00:50:01,040","00:50:02,957","Well, yeah."
tt0120755,"00:50:03,042","00:50:04,709",Naturally Vain.
tt0120755,"00:50:04,794","00:50:06,294",But they're about to close the betting
tt0120755,"00:50:06,379","00:50:08,421",- and I haven't a bean. - Nyah!
tt0120755,"00:50:08,756","00:50:11,383",- Would you mind terribly? - Not at all.
tt0120755,"00:50:11,467","00:50:14,135",But you are gonna pay for it
tt0120755,"00:50:14,679","00:50:16,346",and with interest.
tt0120755,"00:50:17,014","00:50:18,598",I have no doubt.
tt0120755,"00:50:19,767","00:50:21,184",Hold on.
tt0120755,"00:50:35,032","00:50:37,117",Put down a thousand for me.
tt0120755,"00:50:41,497","00:50:43,707",- To win? - What else?
tt0120755,"00:50:47,211","00:50:49,045","Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed."
tt0120755,"00:50:49,130","00:50:50,797","No worries, mate."
tt0120755,"00:50:50,881","00:50:53,717","Luther, digital camera, ready to transmit."
tt0120755,"00:50:53,801","00:50:55,260",Betting table 12.
tt0120755,"00:51:10,192","00:51:12,318",- There you go. - Thanks.
tt0120755,"00:51:14,822","00:51:17,198","Sorry about that, mate. That must have..."
tt0120755,"00:51:18,325","00:51:19,701",Say again?
tt0120755,"00:51:20,828","00:51:23,955","Whatever you're about, in future watch your step."
tt0120755,"00:51:24,039","00:51:26,750",Never know who you might run into.
tt0120755,"00:51:28,335","00:51:30,003",Where's the loo?
tt0120755,"00:51:31,547","00:51:32,839","Thanks, mate."
tt0120755,"00:51:56,739","00:51:58,198",How'd you do?
tt0120755,"00:51:58,699","00:52:00,366",Don't turn around.
tt0120755,"00:52:01,368","00:52:02,702",I managed.
tt0120755,"00:52:09,210","00:52:10,627",You turned around.
tt0120755,"00:52:11,378","00:52:13,755","What are you gonna do, spank me?"
tt0120755,"00:52:39,406","00:52:41,574","I'm booted up. Go, Ethan."
tt0120755,"00:52:48,707","00:52:50,250",Are you getting this?
tt0120755,"00:53:01,470","00:53:03,596","""Sergei Gradski"""
tt0120755,"00:53:04,932","00:53:07,100","""20 hours after exposure."""
tt0120755,"00:53:46,307","00:53:47,432",God.
tt0120755,"00:53:56,150","00:53:57,609",Stamp's out of the loo.
tt0120755,"00:53:57,693","00:54:00,695","He's coming out of the tunnel heading your way, mate."
tt0120755,"00:54:00,863","00:54:03,364",- I want you out of Ambrose's place. - What are you talking about?
tt0120755,"00:54:03,490","00:54:05,783",What's happened? What did you see?
tt0120755,"00:54:09,663","00:54:12,248","Okay, he's coming up behind you, Ethan."
tt0120755,"00:54:12,333","00:54:15,668",You've done your job. I want you out of Australia.
tt0120755,"00:54:15,794","00:54:18,296",- Thirty steps. - How do you suggest I go about it?
tt0120755,"00:54:18,380","00:54:20,089","- Twenty, nineteen... - He's touched your heart,"
tt0120755,"00:54:20,174","00:54:21,758",you're overwhelmed and need to think it over.
tt0120755,"00:54:21,842","00:54:23,593","Fifteen, fourteen."
tt0120755,"00:54:23,677","00:54:25,595","- Twelve, eleven. - I want you out of there now."
tt0120755,"00:54:25,679","00:54:27,263",Give me the earpiece.
tt0120755,"00:54:27,348","00:54:28,848","Nine, Ethan. Eight."
tt0120755,"00:54:28,933","00:54:32,435","If you don't get out of there, I'm coming in and getting you out."
tt0120755,"00:54:32,519","00:54:34,354",Get out of there.
tt0120755,"00:54:36,690","00:54:38,691","You place your bet, ma'am?"
tt0120755,"00:54:41,278","00:54:42,362",Just.
tt0120755,"00:54:45,491","00:54:47,450",Horses are ready to race.

tt0120755,"00:55:18,983","00:55:21,150",I thought you were going to dinner.
tt0120755,"00:55:22,236","00:55:25,655","Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card."
tt0120755,"00:55:27,533","00:55:28,908",Where is it?
tt0120755,"00:55:29,410","00:55:31,911",In the envelope in my jacket pocket.
tt0120755,"00:55:34,832","00:55:37,417",My right jacket pocket.

tt0120755,"00:58:22,082","00:58:23,583",Shh. Shh. Shh.
tt0120755,"00:58:25,919","00:58:27,044",Easy.
tt0120755,"00:58:28,255","00:58:29,589","Oh, Ethan."
tt0120755,"00:58:29,756","00:58:31,257",Are you okay?
tt0120755,"00:58:31,592","00:58:33,176","Yeah, I am now."
tt0120755,"00:59:20,390","00:59:21,682",What is this?
tt0120755,"00:59:22,226","00:59:24,227",A visit from an old friend.
tt0120755,"00:59:26,230","00:59:28,898",You crashed on the plane. You're dead.
tt0120755,"00:59:29,358","00:59:30,983","Tired, certainly."
tt0120755,"00:59:31,068","00:59:33,569",But dead is a little extreme.
tt0120755,"00:59:35,113","00:59:36,322",On the other hand

tt0120755,"00:59:54,258","00:59:56,008","No use, my friend."
tt0120755,"00:59:56,969","00:59:58,427",The medical staff
tt0120755,"00:59:58,512","01:00:00,263",wants no part of this.
tt0120755,"01:00:00,764","01:00:04,308",Doctors don't fancy the idea of dying any more than anybody else.
tt0120755,"01:00:04,810","01:00:06,602",How could I possibly be infected?
tt0120755,"01:00:06,687","01:00:11,232",That's exactly what Gradski said 27 hours before he died.
tt0120755,"01:00:12,609","01:00:15,236","You've got the antidote, you miserable bastard!"
tt0120755,"01:00:15,320","01:00:17,822","- You stole Bellerophon. All of it! - My, my, my."
tt0120755,"01:00:17,906","01:00:18,948",I need it.
tt0120755,"01:00:19,032","01:00:21,701","I need it now, you whacked-out Russian gypsy!"
tt0120755,"01:00:21,785","01:00:26,580","And what about Gradski, who you deliberately infected with Chimera?"
tt0120755,"01:00:26,707","01:00:31,043",How was I to know he needed treatment with Bellerophon within 20 hours?
tt0120755,"01:00:31,128","01:00:32,586",By asking me.
tt0120755,"01:00:32,671","01:00:34,922","You still don't get it, do you?"
tt0120755,"01:00:35,215","01:00:38,884",I needed to know just how bad the disease was in the real world
tt0120755,"01:00:38,969","01:00:40,594",not just the lab.
tt0120755,"01:00:40,887","01:00:44,098",You were genetically splicing together strains of influenza
tt0120755,"01:00:44,182","01:00:46,642",to create a cure for all influenzas.
tt0120755,"01:00:46,727","01:00:50,438",But you were also creating a disease so terrible in Chimera
tt0120755,"01:00:50,981","01:00:53,107",the cure would be priceless.
tt0120755,"01:00:53,191","01:00:56,235",I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.
tt0120755,"01:00:56,320","01:00:59,071","It's not that difficult to understand, is it?"
tt0120755,"01:00:59,448","01:01:02,742","Look, I've got the virus, you've got the cure."
tt0120755,"01:01:02,826","01:01:04,452",I need them both.
tt0120755,"01:01:04,786","01:01:08,998","Time was, a shot of penicillin would knock off every bug in the zoo."
tt0120755,"01:01:09,124","01:01:10,541",Not any more.
tt0120755,"01:01:11,251","01:01:15,129",If I couldn't make money killing the microscopic little shits out there
tt0120755,"01:01:15,422","01:01:18,924",you'd help me put one out there that I could make money on.
tt0120755,"01:01:19,009","01:01:22,178","Well, there it is. I've confessed."
tt0120755,"01:01:23,013","01:01:25,514","L, John C. McCloy"
tt0120755,"01:01:25,766","01:01:29,352",am in business to make money.
tt0120755,"01:01:30,479","01:01:34,440",Now forget any deal you may have made with that thug Ambrose
tt0120755,"01:01:34,858","01:01:37,651","get me treated, and let's go back to work."
tt0120755,"01:01:38,278","01:01:39,528",You know
tt0120755,"01:01:40,447","01:01:44,116",I think it's a little late for that.
tt0120755,"01:01:45,452","01:01:47,661",Do give my regards to Gradski
tt0120755,"01:01:48,830","01:01:50,373",if you see him.
tt0120755,"01:02:01,301","01:02:02,802",Well?
tt0120755,"01:02:06,473","01:02:08,140",I've heard
tt0120755,"01:02:11,895","01:02:13,646",all I need to hear.
tt0120755,"01:02:16,650","01:02:17,858",Nyah.
tt0120755,"01:02:19,694","01:02:24,657",It's imperative that we do nothing to alarm Ambrose.
tt0120755,"01:02:25,575","01:02:26,659",What?
tt0120755,"01:02:28,036","01:02:29,662",You told me to leave as soon as I could.
tt0120755,"01:02:29,746","01:02:31,539",I thought you were here to collect me!
tt0120755,"01:02:34,251","01:02:36,710",Listen to me. There's no time to talk.
tt0120755,"01:02:38,171","01:02:39,547","It is critical,"
tt0120755,"01:02:39,673","01:02:42,258",absolutely critical
tt0120755,"01:02:43,176","01:02:46,345",that you do whatever Ambrose asks.
tt0120755,"01:02:49,724","01:02:51,684",Do you understand me?
tt0120755,"01:02:54,896","01:02:56,188",Don't worry.
tt0120755,"01:02:58,400","01:03:00,192",It will all be over
tt0120755,"01:03:00,902","01:03:02,236",very soon.
tt0120755,"01:03:09,995","01:03:11,412",That's a promise.
tt0120755,"01:03:12,706","01:03:14,039",Come on.
tt0120755,"01:03:17,377","01:03:18,502",Off you go.
tt0120755,"01:03:49,868","01:03:51,410","Luther, we know this much."
tt0120755,"01:03:51,536","01:03:55,247",Nekhorvich gets on a plane to go to the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta.
tt0120755,"01:03:55,415","01:03:58,125","He's carrying a virus he created, Chimera,"
tt0120755,"01:03:58,585","01:04:01,587","and the cure for that virus, Bellerophon."
tt0120755,"01:04:05,091","01:04:06,800",Ambrose doesn't have the virus.
tt0120755,"01:04:06,968","01:04:09,220",That's why Ambrose needs McCloy.
tt0120755,"01:04:10,805","01:04:13,766","So we go into Biocyte, kill Chimera."
tt0120755,"01:04:15,143","01:04:19,230",Ambrose has a cure without a disease and we're home free.
tt0120755,"01:04:20,607","01:04:21,941",You were right.
tt0120755,"01:04:22,025","01:04:24,401",Hunt stung McCloy tonight.
tt0120755,"01:04:25,445","01:04:27,071",So he knows.
tt0120755,"01:04:27,572","01:04:29,698",He'll be going into Biocyte.
tt0120755,"01:04:31,409","01:04:32,576",Good.
tt0120755,"01:04:33,411","01:04:35,913","Then we know where he'll be, don't we?"
tt0120755,"01:04:38,250","01:04:39,750","Well done, Hugh."
tt0120755,"01:04:41,753","01:04:43,128",Well done.
tt0120755,"01:04:55,475","01:04:57,601","You're home, mate. Home."
tt0120755,"01:05:01,439","01:05:04,817","Where's George, my regular driver? Where is he?"
tt0120755,"01:05:04,901","01:05:07,361",He's gone home sick. Touch of the flu.
tt0120755,"01:05:10,490","01:05:11,991",The building up and running yet?
tt0120755,"01:05:16,788","01:05:20,499","- That's not exactly it. - Sorry, but this is a Biocyte facility."
tt0120755,"01:05:20,584","01:05:22,251",Their storage structure.
tt0120755,"01:05:22,335","01:05:23,752",I'll have it up in a minute.
tt0120755,"01:05:26,089","01:05:28,340","Okay, take a look at this."
tt0120755,"01:05:28,633","01:05:29,925",Let's start from the inside out.
tt0120755,"01:05:30,010","01:05:33,095",All storage and production of Chimera is done here
tt0120755,"01:05:33,179","01:05:35,598",in this lab on the 42nd floor.
tt0120755,"01:05:36,349","01:05:38,767",Hunt's target will be the Chimera
tt0120755,"01:05:38,852","01:05:42,855",stored and manufactured at Biocyte on the 42nd floor.
tt0120755,"01:05:44,274","01:05:48,402","If you look at Hunt's operational history, and I have,"
tt0120755,"01:05:48,737","01:05:52,448",he invariably favours misdirection over confrontation.
tt0120755,"01:05:53,283","01:05:55,492","He'll never break into Biocyte from the bottom,"
tt0120755,"01:05:55,577","01:05:57,286",where security is heaviest.
tt0120755,"01:05:57,954","01:05:59,622",No garage entrances.
tt0120755,"01:05:59,789","01:06:03,083",Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
tt0120755,"01:06:04,836","01:06:08,130",Not going in from the ground. Show me the atrium.
tt0120755,"01:06:09,132","01:06:11,925",The atrium? One of a kind.
tt0120755,"01:06:12,385","01:06:14,511",Runs down through the centre of the building.
tt0120755,"01:06:14,596","01:06:18,724","Provides 24-hour natural light via mirrors and daylight storage cells,"
tt0120755,"01:06:18,808","01:06:21,185",optimum growing conditions for the virus.
tt0120755,"01:06:21,269","01:06:24,980",Ends in a glass floor which doubles as part of the lab ceiling.
tt0120755,"01:06:28,318","01:06:29,610",Uh-uh.
tt0120755,"01:06:29,861","01:06:32,279",The atrium roof closes at sundown.
tt0120755,"01:06:32,447","01:06:35,616","And if the louvers are up for more than 40 seconds at night,"
tt0120755,"01:06:35,700","01:06:39,453",the civil emergency alarms are tripped. Those even I can't stop.
tt0120755,"01:06:40,497","01:06:44,625",We have a total of 40 seconds to get you in and the cables out.
tt0120755,"01:06:47,253","01:06:52,174","Hunt will prefer to enter Biocyte from the top, where security is minimal."
tt0120755,"01:06:52,592","01:06:56,136",He'll undoubtedly engage in some aerobatic insanity
tt0120755,"01:06:56,221","01:06:59,431",before he'll risk harming a hair on a security guard's head.
tt0120755,"01:07:14,072","01:07:16,615","- Check, check. Copy? - You're five-by-five."
tt0120755,"01:07:20,995","01:07:22,830","Luther, how we doing?"
tt0120755,"01:07:23,164","01:07:25,416","Not there yet, Ethan. I'll give you the word."
tt0120755,"01:07:28,712","01:07:30,671","Billy, ready to go?"
tt0120755,"01:07:35,593","01:07:38,512",- Package away in five. - Not yet. The louvers aren't moving.
tt0120755,"01:07:38,972","01:07:40,305","Luther, we gotta go."
tt0120755,"01:07:40,390","01:07:42,516",Wait. There's a glitch in the access code.
tt0120755,"01:07:52,402","01:07:55,320","Luther, we're out of time. On the count."
tt0120755,"01:07:55,405","01:07:58,365","Please, baby, open up. Open up."
tt0120755,"01:07:58,450","01:08:00,743","Five, four..."
tt0120755,"01:08:00,952","01:08:03,829","- Come on! - ...three, two, one!"
tt0120755,"01:08:03,913","01:08:06,373","- I'm going now! - Ethan, wait!"
tt0120755,"01:08:42,577","01:08:45,954","25, 24, 23,"
tt0120755,"01:08:46,581","01:08:50,042","22, 21, 20."
tt0120755,"01:08:51,377","01:08:54,213",You've got 19 seconds to clear the cable.
tt0120755,"01:09:02,222","01:09:04,223","Okay, retracting cable."
tt0120755,"01:09:09,395","01:09:10,729",Come on.
tt0120755,"01:09:11,648","01:09:15,901","Nine, eight, seven, six, five,"
tt0120755,"01:09:16,236","01:09:19,071","four, three, two..."
tt0120755,"01:09:20,907","01:09:22,658",Cable's clear!
tt0120755,"01:09:36,422","01:09:38,048",Transponder activated.
tt0120755,"01:09:38,132","01:09:40,425",Reading package and cable clear.
tt0120755,"01:09:49,102","01:09:51,395",He'll breach the lab at the only possible time.
tt0120755,"01:09:51,479","01:09:53,814","Whether you break in from the ground or the roof,"
tt0120755,"01:09:54,274","01:09:57,234","it's 23:00 hours, one minute"
tt0120755,"01:09:57,318","01:10:00,821",when the air filtration generators will cover the sound of Hunt's break-in
tt0120755,"01:10:00,947","01:10:05,117",and rotating guards make the building vulnerable to our break-in from below.
tt0120755,"01:10:07,620","01:10:09,913","Ethan, the generators are about to go active."
tt0120755,"01:10:09,998","01:10:12,916","Just a friendly reminder, we'll be out of contact for eight minutes."
tt0120755,"01:10:45,658","01:10:48,410",I'm betting Hunt will destroy Chimera
tt0120755,"01:10:48,494","01:10:51,330",rather than attempt to preserve any part of it.
tt0120755,"01:10:51,873","01:10:54,041",He'll have to do it in two places.
tt0120755,"01:10:54,834","01:10:56,001","First,"
tt0120755,"01:10:56,878","01:10:59,796",the incubation room where the growth vials are kept.
tt0120755,"01:11:02,300","01:11:05,093","And finally, in the inoculation chamber"
tt0120755,"01:11:05,178","01:11:09,014",holding the last remaining Chimera virus and three injection guns.
tt0120755,"01:11:11,309","01:11:14,811",He won't be allowed to destroy the virus in those guns.
tt0120755,"01:11:30,662","01:11:32,996",What's this? You're on time for once?
tt0120755,"01:11:33,206","01:11:34,873","Not exactly, sport."
tt0120755,"01:11:42,215","01:11:44,049",John C. McCloy.
tt0120755,"01:12:05,238","01:12:07,030","Billy, we've got a problem."
tt0120755,"01:12:07,198","01:12:10,659","Nyah's on the wing up early. Billy, do you copy?"
tt0120755,"01:12:10,743","01:12:13,996","Yeah, I got you, Luther. Exactly where is she?"
tt0120755,"01:12:14,080","01:12:16,540","- In the building. - Say again, mate."
tt0120755,"01:12:17,208","01:12:19,167",Sounds like you said she's in the building.
tt0120755,"01:12:19,252","01:12:20,669",I am. She is.
tt0120755,"01:12:22,338","01:12:25,716","Well, then, she's not likely to be alone, is she?"
tt0120755,"01:12:26,009","01:12:28,510",She's in the elevator headed towards Ethan.
tt0120755,"01:12:28,594","01:12:30,262","The question is, how many of them?"
tt0120755,"01:12:30,388","01:12:33,181",I can't get through to Ethan till the generators go off.
tt0120755,"01:12:33,266","01:12:34,349",When's that?
tt0120755,"01:12:34,434","01:12:37,269",Not for another five-and-a-half minutes.
tt0120755,"01:13:13,264","01:13:15,307",Chimera in vitro pH
tt0120755,"01:13:15,433","01:13:18,894",and temperature level outside optimal range.
tt0120755,"01:13:19,562","01:13:21,480",Chimera in vitro pH
tt0120755,"01:13:21,564","01:13:25,233",and temperature level outside optimal range.
tt0120755,"01:13:25,401","01:13:29,654",Chimera working seed stock pH at critical level.
tt0120755,"01:13:29,989","01:13:33,658",Alert. Chimera stock life threatened.
tt0120755,"01:13:34,160","01:13:37,746",Alert. Chimera stock life terminated.
tt0120755,"01:13:42,960","01:13:45,670","Come on, Ethan. Come on."
tt0120755,"01:14:02,647","01:14:06,608",Subject is contaminant-free. Zero contaminant factor.
tt0120755,"01:14:18,746","01:14:20,622","Come on, come on."
tt0120755,"01:14:21,457","01:14:23,834","Luther, what the hell can we do?"
tt0120755,"01:14:24,293","01:14:25,627",What can we do?
tt0120755,"01:14:26,504","01:14:30,173",Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
tt0120755,"01:15:22,018","01:15:23,393","However we travel,"
tt0120755,"01:15:23,477","01:15:27,564",I must arrive at my destination within 20 hours of departure.
tt0120755,"01:15:32,945","01:15:37,199",How was I to know he needed treatment with Bellerophon within 20 hours?
tt0120755,"01:16:01,349","01:16:02,515",Get him.
tt0120755,"01:16:25,498","01:16:27,332",How much longer before you can reach him?
tt0120755,"01:16:27,416","01:16:30,543",We got 29 seconds before the generators turn off.
tt0120755,"01:16:30,628","01:16:32,671",Then Ethan'll be back on line.
tt0120755,"01:17:19,218","01:17:20,552",Luther!
tt0120755,"01:17:53,419","01:17:55,503",Hold your fire!
tt0120755,"01:17:55,588","01:17:57,672","Hold your fire, damn it!"
tt0120755,"01:18:12,271","01:18:13,813","Well, Hunt,"
tt0120755,"01:18:15,900","01:18:17,442",how you been?
tt0120755,"01:18:21,030","01:18:22,572",Fighting a bit of a cold.
tt0120755,"01:18:27,995","01:18:30,747","That was the hardest part of having to portray you,"
tt0120755,"01:18:30,956","01:18:33,875",grinning like an idiot every 15 minutes.
tt0120755,"01:18:35,336","01:18:38,296",I always thought the hardest part was kerbing that pressing need of yours
tt0120755,"01:18:38,381","01:18:39,839",to get your gun off.
tt0120755,"01:18:40,800","01:18:43,635","You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747,"
tt0120755,"01:18:43,719","01:18:45,804",you never figured out where Chimera really was.
tt0120755,"01:18:46,180","01:18:48,431",- I knew where it was. - Oh.
tt0120755,"01:18:49,058","01:18:52,143",Then you knew the only way Nekhorvich could smuggle the live virus
tt0120755,"01:18:52,228","01:18:53,478","was by injecting himself,"
tt0120755,"01:18:53,562","01:18:55,772",and using his own bloodstream as a petri dish.
tt0120755,"01:18:55,856","01:18:57,315",You knew that
tt0120755,"01:18:58,109","01:19:01,736","while you were knocking him off, destroying the very thing you came for."
tt0120755,"01:19:08,327","01:19:10,453",Stop!
tt0120755,"01:19:10,538","01:19:12,330",Put a sock in it!
tt0120755,"01:19:14,708","01:19:18,253","Hit that bloody gun, and you'll spread that virus all over the place!"
tt0120755,"01:19:19,463","01:19:21,297","There it is, guys."
tt0120755,"01:19:23,300","01:19:24,843",The last of it.
tt0120755,"01:19:25,970","01:19:27,303",What was the top bid?
tt0120755,"01:19:27,430","01:19:29,931",Why? You gonna make me a better offer?
tt0120755,"01:19:30,433","01:19:34,060",Than 37 million pounds? Not really.
tt0120755,"01:19:35,229","01:19:36,312",Oh.
tt0120755,"01:19:36,814","01:19:40,942",Somebody has been slipping you our mail.
tt0120755,"01:19:41,777","01:19:45,363","Come on out here, you bad girl."
tt0120755,"01:19:58,836","01:20:00,545",She doesn't belong here.
tt0120755,"01:20:00,796","01:20:02,213",Let her go.
tt0120755,"01:20:02,590","01:20:08,219","She wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt."
tt0120755,"01:20:15,519","01:20:20,023","From this moment, you are responsible for what happens to her."
tt0120755,"01:20:20,107","01:20:22,692","And if you're looking out for her well-being,"
tt0120755,"01:20:22,776","01:20:27,739",I suggest you advise her to pick up the injection gun and bring it to me.
tt0120755,"01:20:29,575","01:20:31,868","The ball's in your court, Hunt."
tt0120755,"01:20:38,834","01:20:40,627",Nyah's in the building.
tt0120755,"01:20:41,170","01:20:42,629",Do you copy?
tt0120755,"01:20:43,589","01:20:44,923",Thank you.
tt0120755,"01:21:01,273","01:21:04,025",How do you know he won't shoot you the minute he's got it?
tt0120755,"01:21:04,693","01:21:07,278",One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions.
tt0120755,"01:21:07,363","01:21:08,863","You know women, mate."
tt0120755,"01:21:09,490","01:21:11,366",Like monkeys they are.
tt0120755,"01:21:11,784","01:21:14,953",Won't let go of one branch till they get a grip on the next.
tt0120755,"01:21:17,665","01:21:20,625","Get it, Nyah. I'll cover you."
tt0120755,"01:21:53,826","01:21:56,035",I am waiting.
tt0120755,"01:22:07,172","01:22:10,675","Things haven't exactly worked out the way you thought they would, Ethan."
tt0120755,"01:22:12,595","01:22:13,886",Sorry.
tt0120755,"01:22:30,696","01:22:32,530",You bitch!
tt0120755,"01:22:48,464","01:22:52,383","You're not gonna shoot me, Sean. Not this bitch."
tt0120755,"01:22:52,551","01:22:56,304",'Cause she's worth 37 million pounds.
tt0120755,"01:23:27,252","01:23:30,797",- What did you think you were doing? - I wasn't thinking!
tt0120755,"01:23:31,173","01:23:33,966","Just trying to stop you from getting hurt, that's all."
tt0120755,"01:23:34,760","01:23:36,969",You who don't have a conscience.
tt0120755,"01:23:37,596","01:23:39,263",I guess I lied.
tt0120755,"01:24:06,667","01:24:09,043","You can't get us both out of here, can you?"
tt0120755,"01:24:22,641","01:24:24,559",I'm infected with Chimera.
tt0120755,"01:24:24,643","01:24:27,645",You know you don't have a choice. Just do it.
tt0120755,"01:24:29,064","01:24:30,815",Do it. Now!
tt0120755,"01:24:51,336","01:24:54,505",We've got 19 hours and 58 minutes.
tt0120755,"01:24:54,673","01:24:57,842",I'll get Bellerophon into your system before then.
tt0120755,"01:25:00,679","01:25:04,724",Just stay alive! I'm not going to lose you!
tt0120755,"01:26:15,087","01:26:17,505",Feel like pleading for your life?
tt0120755,"01:26:22,928","01:26:29,475","Well, then how about dying so you can make me a lot of money."
tt0120755,"01:26:35,691","01:26:37,984",In just a few hours time
tt0120755,"01:26:38,527","01:26:42,947",you can be assured of going down in history as the Typhoid Mary of Oz.
tt0120755,"01:26:44,449","01:26:45,783",Good day.
tt0120755,"01:26:49,663","01:26:52,915",There's not a chance of locating Nyah until I can access the satellite.
tt0120755,"01:26:53,000","01:26:55,710","I can't do that till I get this computer fixed,"
tt0120755,"01:26:55,794","01:26:57,211",and that's taking a while.
tt0120755,"01:26:57,296","01:26:59,881",- How much time does she have left? - Not long.
tt0120755,"01:27:00,382","01:27:04,093",- But Nyah will take care of Nyah. - What do you mean?
tt0120755,"01:27:04,177","01:27:07,138","Unless we dose her with Bellerophon, Nyah will kill herself."
tt0120755,"01:27:08,724","01:27:10,308",So first things first.
tt0120755,"01:28:06,615","01:28:08,991","Ambrose and his team have arrived over the bridge,"
tt0120755,"01:28:09,076","01:28:10,326",and Nyah's not with him.
tt0120755,"01:28:10,410","01:28:11,452",Copy that.
tt0120755,"01:28:19,211","01:28:22,880","You all right, mate? Looks like heavy security from here."
tt0120755,"01:28:23,715","01:28:25,383",What's it look like from there?
tt0120755,"01:28:27,469","01:28:28,719",Risky.
tt0120755,"01:29:47,716","01:29:48,966",Simon.
tt0120755,"01:29:51,386","01:29:52,636",Stay here.
tt0120755,"01:30:09,404","01:30:11,572",Breached the structure at the 10:00 grating.
tt0120755,"01:30:23,835","01:30:27,713",It's a DNA match. The blood's loaded with Chimera.
tt0120755,"01:30:36,681","01:30:39,350",And they certainly have Bellerophon.
tt0120755,"01:30:41,853","01:30:46,398","You've got the virus and the antivirus, which means I've got 30 million for you."
tt0120755,"01:30:46,608","01:30:50,319",Not exactly. We don't want just your cash.
tt0120755,"01:30:50,403","01:30:54,365","- What do you want? - Stock, Mr McCloy."
tt0120755,"01:30:55,075","01:30:58,369",Stock options to be a little more precise.
tt0120755,"01:31:06,044","01:31:09,922",Cut her loose right in the centre of town.
tt0120755,"01:31:10,298","01:31:12,049","The more crowded, the better."
tt0120755,"01:31:14,469","01:31:15,886",Just picked up an Ambrose call.
tt0120755,"01:31:15,971","01:31:17,471",Nyah's been dropped off.
tt0120755,"01:31:17,556","01:31:19,390",- I think she's still alive. - Where is she?
tt0120755,"01:31:19,933","01:31:21,725",Somewhere in Sydney.
tt0120755,"01:31:32,070","01:31:34,780",Somewhere in Sydney? Care to harden the target?
tt0120755,"01:31:35,740","01:31:39,243",I can't until I can get the GPS up on our computer. It's still down.
tt0120755,"01:31:41,329","01:31:43,247",The clock is ticking.
tt0120755,"01:31:44,082","01:31:46,876",How quickly can you manufacture more of the antivirus?
tt0120755,"01:31:46,960","01:31:49,753","- No time at all, once I've got it. - Good."
tt0120755,"01:31:49,963","01:31:53,048",Biocyte stock is just a few weeks away from going through the roof.
tt0120755,"01:31:53,133","01:31:55,926",- What are you talking about? - An outbreak of Chimera.
tt0120755,"01:31:56,094","01:31:59,763","- Where? - Downtown Sydney, for a start."
tt0120755,"01:31:59,931","01:32:03,392","You create the supply, Mr McCloy. We've just created the demand."
tt0120755,"01:32:03,476","01:32:07,563",Three million people in Sydney and 17 million people in Australia
tt0120755,"01:32:07,647","01:32:10,357",are going to need Bellerophon within the next few days.
tt0120755,"01:32:10,483","01:32:12,276",Not to mention the rest of the world.
tt0120755,"01:32:12,819","01:32:14,945","Now, this is how it's going to work."
tt0120755,"01:32:15,447","01:32:18,073",- The shares outstanding are? - 93.4 million.
tt0120755,"01:32:18,158","01:32:19,575","Which means, Mr McCloy,"
tt0120755,"01:32:19,659","01:32:23,412","we need to get our hands on 480,000 options."
tt0120755,"01:32:23,496","01:32:26,290",We'll borrow your 30 million to buy those options.
tt0120755,"01:32:26,374","01:32:29,752",Your stock has never sold above $31 a share.
tt0120755,"01:32:29,836","01:32:33,964","When your stock goes north of 200, which it will,"
tt0120755,"01:32:34,049","01:32:36,217","those options will be worth billions,"
tt0120755,"01:32:36,384","01:32:41,680",and I will own 51 percent of Biocyte.
tt0120755,"01:32:41,890","01:32:43,474",This is outrageous.
tt0120755,"01:32:44,476","01:32:47,811",I will not let you take control of my company.
tt0120755,"01:32:48,313","01:32:50,356",Sit down.
tt0120755,"01:33:30,188","01:33:33,148",You'll be a billionaire. That's better than being broke.
tt0120755,"01:33:33,233","01:33:36,151",I have terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies
tt0120755,"01:33:36,236","01:33:37,528",standing in line.
tt0120755,"01:33:43,743","01:33:46,245","The ball's in your court, Mr McCloy."
tt0120755,"01:34:41,259","01:34:44,094",Run that bastard down.
tt0120755,"01:34:58,443","01:35:01,403","We're running short on time, Mr McCloy."
tt0120755,"01:35:02,280","01:35:04,823",We have got to conclude our business.
tt0120755,"01:35:06,743","01:35:07,951",Yes.
tt0120755,"01:35:08,828","01:35:10,287",Start the transfer.
tt0120755,"01:35:16,669","01:35:19,505",Follow it and let me know.
tt0120755,"01:36:28,867","01:36:31,243",Raise your hands very slowly.
tt0120755,"01:36:31,870","01:36:33,996",Sure you want me to do this?
tt0120755,"01:36:34,914","01:36:38,041",Raise your hands very slowly.
tt0120755,"01:37:11,576","01:37:13,243","Ethan. Ethan, do you copy?"
tt0120755,"01:37:19,751","01:37:22,419",Keep it going.
tt0120755,"01:37:29,594","01:37:33,388","Sean, this rat's reached the end of the maze."
tt0120755,"01:37:34,432","01:37:35,974",Is he alive?
tt0120755,"01:37:36,434","01:37:38,769","Yeah, more or less."
tt0120755,"01:37:40,772","01:37:42,856",Bring him to me.
tt0120755,"01:37:43,274","01:37:44,316",Go.
tt0120755,"01:37:51,407","01:37:54,201","Sean, transfer completed."
tt0120755,"01:38:15,223","01:38:18,225","Well done, Stamp. Well done."
tt0120755,"01:38:37,412","01:38:39,454",Stop mumbling!
tt0120755,"01:38:39,539","01:38:44,167",I'm afraid he's got no choice. I believe I broke his jaw.
tt0120755,"01:38:45,169","01:38:48,171","Stamp, I'm impressed."
tt0120755,"01:38:49,424","01:38:50,924","We don't have a lot of time, Hunt."
tt0120755,"01:38:51,009","01:38:53,802","Whatever you've got to say, say it now."
tt0120755,"01:38:55,555","01:38:58,390",How about giving us a big smile?
tt0120755,"01:39:01,060","01:39:02,144",No?
tt0120755,"01:39:02,228","01:39:03,645",What are you doing?
tt0120755,"01:39:05,106","01:39:08,775",Get down on your knees.
tt0120755,"01:39:11,362","01:39:15,574","Now, this is what's known"
tt0120755,"01:39:15,867","01:39:18,160",as getting your gun off.
tt0120755,"01:40:28,940","01:40:30,399",There he is!
tt0120755,"01:40:41,035","01:40:42,369",Ethan!
tt0120755,"01:40:58,010","01:41:00,971",Just back off and pinpoint their positions!
tt0120755,"01:41:59,197","01:42:01,615","Luther, clear the bridge for me."
tt0120755,"01:42:05,745","01:42:09,080","Hunt's heading for the bridge, coming in at 12:00 high."
tt0120755,"01:42:25,723","01:42:27,390","Oh, I'm mad now."
tt0120755,"01:43:38,129","01:43:41,464","- You all right, mate? - That punk put a hole in my Versace."
tt0120755,"01:44:45,363","01:44:47,656","Ethan, the computer's up. I've got Nyah."
tt0120755,"01:44:47,740","01:44:49,366",She's moved out of the city.
tt0120755,"01:44:49,450","01:44:51,701","She's on the north bluff approaching the cliffs,"
tt0120755,"01:44:51,786","01:44:53,370",but I can't get a visual.
tt0120755,"01:44:53,454","01:44:56,581",Copy! She's only got a little time left!
tt0120755,"01:44:56,666","01:44:59,292",Track ahead and pick her up!
tt0120755,"01:45:06,050","01:45:07,634",I can't get a good shot!
tt0120755,"01:45:07,718","01:45:09,552","Ethan, we won't be able to cover you."
tt0120755,"01:45:10,513","01:45:14,224",My earpiece is failing. You've got me on GPS.
tt0120755,"01:45:14,308","01:45:16,226",Bring her to me.
tt0120755,"01:45:24,652","01:45:27,112","Billy, north head bluff. Haul ass."
tt0120755,"01:45:54,015","01:45:57,392",- Get out there and keep firing! - I can't see anything!
tt0120755,"01:45:57,518","01:46:00,145","Slow down, mate, slow down!"
tt0120755,"01:48:00,432","01:48:02,225","Range is 2 ""K."""
tt0120755,"01:51:35,939","01:51:38,441","Go ahead. Use it, Hunt."
tt0120755,"01:51:39,318","01:51:41,110",It's not a bad way to go.
tt0120755,"01:51:42,029","01:51:45,114",It's a lot better than the way that bitch is gonna die.
tt0120755,"01:52:32,746","01:52:34,163",There she is!
tt0120755,"01:54:39,248","01:54:40,456",Hunt!
tt0120755,"01:54:44,211","01:54:47,588",You should've killed me.
tt0120755,"01:56:27,272","01:56:31,150","Miss Hall's blood has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus,"
tt0120755,"01:56:31,234","01:56:32,902",not even antibodies.
tt0120755,"01:56:34,738","01:56:36,656","Yes, I gathered as much."
tt0120755,"01:56:36,740","01:56:42,411",But you were under specific instructions to retrieve a live sample of the virus.
tt0120755,"01:56:42,996","01:56:46,165","I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed this recovery,"
tt0120755,"01:56:46,249","01:56:48,417",it subsequently got destroyed.
tt0120755,"01:56:49,586","01:56:50,920",By fire.
tt0120755,"01:56:51,505","01:56:53,798","- It's the best way, really. - Oh."
tt0120755,"01:56:55,467","01:56:59,679","Well, as for Miss Hall, in light of her efforts"
tt0120755,"01:57:01,139","01:57:04,266",her criminal record will certainly be expunged.
tt0120755,"01:57:04,351","01:57:05,559",Wiped out.
tt0120755,"01:57:05,936","01:57:07,937",I'm assuming you approve.
tt0120755,"01:57:11,191","01:57:12,358",I do.
tt0120755,"01:57:13,944","01:57:15,736",Where is she now? Any idea?
tt0120755,"01:57:17,114","01:57:19,448",I don't know. Not exactly.
tt0120755,"01:57:20,909","01:57:23,452",- So what are your plans? - I don't know.
tt0120755,"01:57:24,955","01:57:28,624",Some sort of vacation. I'll let you know where I'm going.
tt0120755,"01:57:29,835","01:57:31,293",Don't have to do that.
tt0120755,"01:57:32,629","01:57:34,630",It wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
tt0120755,"01:58:25,348","01:58:27,224",Let's get lost.
tt0317919,"00:00:30,197","00:00:32,616",<i>We've put an explosive charge in your head.</i>
tt0317919,"00:00:38,872","00:00:40,123",Does that sound familiar?
tt0317919,"00:00:43,836","00:00:46,004",The Rabbit's Foot. Where is it?
tt0317919,"00:00:47,130","00:00:48,757",I gave it to you.
tt0317919,"00:00:48,882","00:00:51,885","Ethan, where's the Rabbit's Foot?"
tt0317919,"00:00:52,553","00:00:55,764",Wait... What are you saying? That wasn't it?
tt0317919,"00:00:56,348","00:00:59,518","- What I gave you, was that... - I'm going to count to 10."
tt0317919,"00:00:59,643","00:01:03,689",You're going to tell me where the Rabbit's Foot is or she dies.
tt0317919,"00:01:11,738","00:01:14,116","Jules, it's going to be okay."
tt0317919,"00:01:15,284","00:01:17,870",It's going to be okay. Do you understand?
tt0317919,"00:01:19,037","00:01:20,163",One.
tt0317919,"00:01:20,414","00:01:23,542",You listen to me. I got exactly what you asked for.
tt0317919,"00:01:23,667","00:01:25,919",Did you want something else?
tt0317919,"00:01:26,461","00:01:28,172","If there was a misunderstanding, I will fix it."
tt0317919,"00:01:28,297","00:01:30,174","I can get it, whatever you want."
tt0317919,"00:01:30,299","00:01:31,466",Two.
tt0317919,"00:01:31,967","00:01:35,012","Listen. Talk to me. We can talk,"
tt0317919,"00:01:35,345","00:01:36,889",like gentlemen.
tt0317919,"00:01:38,807","00:01:40,851",- Three. - God!
tt0317919,"00:01:50,027","00:01:52,654","All right. All right, all right."
tt0317919,"00:01:54,198","00:01:56,700",I know where the Rabbit's Foot is.
tt0317919,"00:01:57,910","00:01:58,994",I can help you.
tt0317919,"00:01:59,119","00:02:01,788",The way you helped me on the aeroplane?
tt0317919,"00:02:02,289","00:02:03,582",That way?
tt0317919,"00:02:04,082","00:02:06,585",You put the gun down. I'm not talking to you like this.
tt0317919,"00:02:06,710","00:02:09,129",That's your choice. Four.
tt0317919,"00:02:10,547","00:02:12,090",The Rabbit's Foot's in Paris.
tt0317919,"00:02:12,216","00:02:14,927",You want to know where in Paris? Then let her go.
tt0317919,"00:02:15,052","00:02:18,138",- 'Cause you will not... - It's not in Paris. Five.
tt0317919,"00:02:20,057","00:02:21,683",I can get it for you.
tt0317919,"00:02:21,808","00:02:23,685","But you kill her, you do this, you get nothing."
tt0317919,"00:02:23,810","00:02:26,021",- Six. - Are you listening to me?
tt0317919,"00:02:26,146","00:02:28,440",The only way you're going to get what you want is for you to...
tt0317919,"00:02:29,399","00:02:31,485",- Do you think I'm playing? - Son of a bitch!
tt0317919,"00:02:31,610","00:02:33,904",Do you think I'm playing? You don't think I'll do it?
tt0317919,"00:02:34,029","00:02:35,864",Where is it? Where the hell is it?
tt0317919,"00:02:35,989","00:02:37,407",- Look at me. - Where the hell is it?
tt0317919,"00:02:37,533","00:02:39,952",- Stay with me. - Seven! Seven!
tt0317919,"00:02:40,077","00:02:44,581",I am going to kill you. I swear to God I'm going to kill you!
tt0317919,"00:02:44,706","00:02:46,750","- Eight! - No, please."
tt0317919,"00:02:52,005","00:02:55,592",Please. Don't do this. Just let her go.
tt0317919,"00:02:57,219","00:03:00,514",I promise you. I promise you.
tt0317919,"00:03:00,639","00:03:03,100",- I can figure out how to get whatever... - Nine.
tt0317919,"00:03:04,476","00:03:06,603",Listen to me. Listen to me.
tt0317919,"00:03:08,272","00:03:10,065",I want to help you.
tt0317919,"00:03:10,357","00:03:12,901",I want to help you get whatever you want.
tt0317919,"00:03:13,026","00:03:16,697",But you got to do what's right. What you know is right.
tt0317919,"00:03:22,953","00:03:25,581",No. No.
tt0317919,"00:03:29,334","00:03:30,377",No.
tt0317919,"00:03:30,502","00:03:31,920",- Ten. - Don't!
tt0317919,"00:04:10,209","00:04:12,127",- What are you doing? - Your brother wants another one.
tt0317919,"00:04:12,252","00:04:13,879","Oh, God, no. Ethan, that's what we talked about..."
tt0317919,"00:04:14,004","00:04:15,964",- I'm watching him. He's fine. - That's how it is with Rick.
tt0317919,"00:04:16,089","00:04:18,634",He's fine and then suddenly he's naked and he's hugging everybody.
tt0317919,"00:04:18,759","00:04:21,595",- I'll take full responsibility for Rick. - You will? Full?
tt0317919,"00:04:21,720","00:04:24,181","- Well, mostly full. - It's a huge responsibility."
tt0317919,"00:04:24,306","00:04:25,849","It's going well, right?"
tt0317919,"00:04:25,974","00:04:28,268",- It's going really well. - Yeah.
tt0317919,"00:04:29,436","00:04:30,896","Julia, your sister's here."
tt0317919,"00:04:31,563","00:04:34,024",- Give me a hug. - You look so beautiful.
tt0317919,"00:04:34,149","00:04:36,193","I don't know about that. So, is this him?"
tt0317919,"00:04:36,318","00:04:38,946","- I hope so. - Oh, come here. Oh, gosh."
tt0317919,"00:04:39,821","00:04:41,615",All right. Mom's dying to see you.
tt0317919,"00:04:41,740","00:04:43,742",I can't believe you guys came all the way to Virginia.
tt0317919,"00:04:43,867","00:04:45,077",Like we'd miss your engagement...
tt0317919,"00:04:45,202","00:04:49,039","When Julia called and told me that she was getting married,"
tt0317919,"00:04:49,164","00:04:52,125","I had one thought, that it was just too bad"
tt0317919,"00:04:53,210","00:04:56,505",that Daddy wasn't here to walk her down the aisle.
tt0317919,"00:04:57,089","00:04:59,842","And then when Julia told me... Thanks, Mom."
tt0317919,"00:04:59,967","00:05:02,386","That Ethan doesn't have his parents anymore, either,"
tt0317919,"00:05:02,511","00:05:04,304",I got really sad.
tt0317919,"00:05:04,429","00:05:08,600",But it occurred to me that this is about starting a new family
tt0317919,"00:05:08,892","00:05:10,644",and how beautiful that is.
tt0317919,"00:05:10,769","00:05:13,897","And I just want to say I am making Julia an aunt,"
tt0317919,"00:05:14,022","00:05:16,817","so I expect the same treatment very, very soon."
tt0317919,"00:05:16,942","00:05:18,193",Cheers!
tt0317919,"00:05:23,907","00:05:25,200",Department of Transportation?
tt0317919,"00:05:25,325","00:05:27,494",I've been there over 10 years now. Wow.
tt0317919,"00:05:27,619","00:05:29,162",What do you do at the DOT?
tt0317919,"00:05:29,288","00:05:30,789",I study traffic patterns.
tt0317919,"00:05:30,914","00:05:33,208","You hit the brakes for a second, just tap them on the freeway,"
tt0317919,"00:05:33,333","00:05:35,169",you can literally track the ripple effect of that action
tt0317919,"00:05:35,294","00:05:36,795","across a 200-mile stretch of road,"
tt0317919,"00:05:36,920","00:05:38,213",because traffic has a memory.
tt0317919,"00:05:38,338","00:05:40,299",It's amazing. It's like a living organism.
tt0317919,"00:05:40,424","00:05:42,092","Freshen that up for you? What is it, vodka martini?"
tt0317919,"00:05:42,217","00:05:43,302",Yeah. Thanks.
tt0317919,"00:05:43,427","00:05:45,345","Ladies, do you need..."
tt0317919,"00:05:48,849","00:05:50,392","- I'd marry him. - I would, too."
tt0317919,"00:05:50,517","00:05:53,353","Okay, so, a three-week heli-boarding honeymoon?"
tt0317919,"00:05:53,478","00:05:56,356","- Okay, you actually get dropped... - From a helicopter, yeah."
tt0317919,"00:05:56,481","00:05:58,442",- It's how they met. - Really?
tt0317919,"00:05:58,567","00:06:00,402",- Tell her the story. - There's no story.
tt0317919,"00:06:00,527","00:06:02,112",It is a good story. Tell the story.
tt0317919,"00:06:02,237","00:06:05,282","First of all, no one was ever good enough for Julia."
tt0317919,"00:06:05,407","00:06:06,617","Oh, here we go."
tt0317919,"00:06:06,742","00:06:10,662","Not spontaneous enough, adventurous enough, funny enough..."
tt0317919,"00:06:10,787","00:06:13,540","You know what? No, that's not true. You make it sound like I've never dated."
tt0317919,"00:06:13,665","00:06:14,666",No one we liked.
tt0317919,"00:06:14,791","00:06:16,335",- That is true. - That is true.
tt0317919,"00:06:30,641","00:06:33,977",Then she goes and gets in a chopper that takes off from this lake...
tt0317919,"00:06:34,102","00:06:36,897",- What was the name of that lake? - Lake...
tt0317919,"00:06:37,898","00:06:40,359",Lake Wanaka. Wanaka.
tt0317919,"00:06:41,151","00:06:42,861",Wanaka. Thank you.
tt0317919,"00:06:44,029","00:06:45,697",- He heard that? - How did he hear that?
tt0317919,"00:06:45,822","00:06:47,783",And the hospital's cool with you taking three weeks?
tt0317919,"00:06:47,908","00:06:50,118","Yeah, I'm not the only nurse employed there, you know."
tt0317919,"00:07:16,562","00:07:18,856","I'm psyched that you're going to be my brother, man."
tt0317919,"00:07:18,981","00:07:19,982","So am I, Rick."
tt0317919,"00:07:20,107","00:07:21,942","No, it's awesome. I think it's going to be sick."
tt0317919,"00:07:22,067","00:07:24,444","Me, too, man. I just got to get the phone."
tt0317919,"00:07:24,570","00:07:26,405",- You rock hard. - Okay.
tt0317919,"00:07:27,489","00:07:28,532",Hello?
tt0317919,"00:07:28,657","00:07:30,742","<i>- Is this Mr Ethan Hunt?</i> - Yes, it is."
tt0317919,"00:07:30,868","00:07:33,328",<i>This is Ready-Travel Resort Services.</i>
tt0317919,"00:07:33,453","00:07:38,083",<i>We'd like to offer you a chance to win an all-expense-paid trip to Mexico.</i>
tt0317919,"00:07:56,768","00:07:58,770",We ran out of ice. I'll be back in 10 minutes.
tt0317919,"00:07:58,896","00:08:01,148","- Oh, no. Can't somebody else go? - No, I got it."
tt0317919,"00:08:01,273","00:08:03,192","I'll be right back. Hi, Betsy."
tt0317919,"00:08:03,317","00:08:04,651",Thank you.
tt0317919,"00:08:22,336","00:08:23,754",$1.86.
tt0317919,"00:08:33,347","00:08:37,142",Thanks for coming. Can't decide what size Slurpee to get.
tt0317919,"00:08:37,809","00:08:40,229",I usually go for the 900-ouncer.
tt0317919,"00:08:41,980","00:08:44,608",How's that party? Sorry I had to call you.
tt0317919,"00:08:44,733","00:08:46,693","- Yeah, you should have come. - You should have invited me."
tt0317919,"00:08:46,818","00:08:49,196",- You know I would have. - Thanks.
tt0317919,"00:08:51,698","00:08:54,785","I know we joke about it, but I am always this close to begging you"
tt0317919,"00:08:54,910","00:08:57,246",to stop training our people and get your ass back in the field.
tt0317919,"00:08:57,371","00:09:00,207","But that's not what you do anymore, and so I respect that choice."
tt0317919,"00:09:00,332","00:09:04,461",You know I do. Family's everything.
tt0317919,"00:09:06,713","00:09:09,049","Come on, John. What's going on?"
tt0317919,"00:09:12,970","00:09:14,721",It's Agent Farris.
tt0317919,"00:09:15,305","00:09:17,349",She was on an operation.
tt0317919,"00:09:18,058","00:09:21,478",She's disappeared. Been off-grid 11 hours.
tt0317919,"00:09:23,188","00:09:27,109",I'm sending in Search and Rescue. I was hoping you'd want in.
tt0317919,"00:09:31,905","00:09:34,283",You've got good people for that.
tt0317919,"00:09:37,327","00:09:39,913","Yeah. Yep, that we do."
tt0317919,"00:09:40,497","00:09:43,917",Wheels up at sunrise if you have a change of heart.
tt0317919,"00:09:44,501","00:09:47,254",Take some pictures of the party for me.
tt0317919,"00:10:06,982","00:10:08,692","<i>Ethan. Three days ago,</i>"

tt0317919,"00:10:30,589","00:10:33,133",<i>They stopped at a derelict factory outside Berlin.</i>
tt0317919,"00:10:33,258","00:10:36,512",<i>It appears they have a hostage. We believe it's Agent Farris.</i>

tt0317919,"00:10:38,847","00:10:40,891","<i>but Lindsey may be the key to getting us closer to Davian,</i>"
tt0317919,"00:10:41,016","00:10:42,684",<i>and that's a risk we need to take.</i>

tt0317919,"00:10:45,646","00:10:48,106",<i>is to find Lindsey and bring her home.</i>

tt0317919,"00:23:55,477","00:23:57,396",They injected you with a time-release charge.

tt0317919,"00:25:23,899","00:25:25,108",I got them!

tt0317919,"00:27:47,376","00:27:50,587",Because we've got a corpse downstairs that says otherwise.

tt0317919,"00:28:11,692","00:28:14,653",So you go to recover her. You encounter a dozen men.
tt0317919,"00:28:14,778","00:28:16,405",You don't grab any of them?
tt0317919,"00:28:16,530","00:28:20,159","Our objective, Mr Brassel, was to recover Agent Farris."
tt0317919,"00:28:21,118","00:28:23,245",Davian employs a cellular structure at his organisation.
tt0317919,"00:28:23,370","00:28:25,414",The men there more than likely had no information...
tt0317919,"00:28:25,539","00:28:28,542",Who's drawing these conclusions? Is it you?
tt0317919,"00:28:28,667","00:28:31,795","- I am, sir. Based upon... - I'm not on you yet."
tt0317919,"00:28:32,546","00:28:35,007",You allowed Farris to board your chopper without a scan.
tt0317919,"00:28:35,132","00:28:37,176",That explosive device could have taken you all out.
tt0317919,"00:28:37,301","00:28:41,763","There is one reason that you are sitting here before me today, and that is luck."
tt0317919,"00:28:41,889","00:28:46,143",Because your operation was poorly conceived and executed worse.
tt0317919,"00:28:46,268","00:28:48,562",- Two laptops were recovered... - I'm aware of that.
tt0317919,"00:28:48,687","00:28:50,022",We've talked to Tech Services.
tt0317919,"00:28:50,147","00:28:52,482",They doubt if they can reconstitute the drives.
tt0317919,"00:28:52,608","00:28:55,861","""Crispy,"" I believe, is what they called them. Worthless."
tt0317919,"00:28:55,986","00:28:58,238","Mr Brassel, as Operation Manager of this office,"
tt0317919,"00:28:58,363","00:28:59,781",- I have the authority... - Excuse me.
tt0317919,"00:28:59,907","00:29:02,951","Did you just throw a title at me, Mr Musgrave?"
tt0317919,"00:29:03,076","00:29:06,413",I don't care if your daddy plays golf with the President.
tt0317919,"00:29:06,538","00:29:09,625",This is Intelligence. So far I haven't seen any.
tt0317919,"00:29:09,750","00:29:12,878","You think this op was worth the risk, Mr Hunt."
tt0317919,"00:29:13,837","00:29:16,423",What do you know about Owen Davian?
tt0317919,"00:29:17,508","00:29:20,010",He was the one who brought gas centrifuge technology
tt0317919,"00:29:20,135","00:29:22,179",to Korea from Pakistan.
tt0317919,"00:29:22,304","00:29:26,475",He was also the man who sold Toxin Five to the Armahad Republic Jihad.
tt0317919,"00:29:26,892","00:29:31,146","He is a man who provides, provides, provides!"
tt0317919,"00:29:32,481","00:29:36,151",And he remains invisible. He's a goddamn invisible man.
tt0317919,"00:29:36,276","00:29:39,196","Wells, not Ellison, in case you want to be cute again."
tt0317919,"00:29:39,321","00:29:41,073",We can't find him.
tt0317919,"00:29:42,241","00:29:45,661",He knows it. It's emboldened him.
tt0317919,"00:29:46,995","00:29:49,540",I've been trying to bring Davian down since the day that I got here.
tt0317919,"00:29:49,665","00:29:50,833",Do you know what I've got for it?
tt0317919,"00:29:50,958","00:29:53,168",It's never been confirmed the Toxin Five theft was Davian.
tt0317919,"00:29:53,293","00:29:57,297","Mr Musgrave, please don't interrupt me when I'm asking rhetorical questions."
tt0317919,"00:29:57,422","00:29:59,508",Your operation has achieved one thing.
tt0317919,"00:29:59,633","00:30:02,845",You have reminded Davian that he is winning.
tt0317919,"00:30:04,346","00:30:07,307","And now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go inform Mr and Mrs Farris"
tt0317919,"00:30:07,432","00:30:11,311",that their baby girl was killed in a head-on collision on I-95.
tt0317919,"00:30:13,397","00:30:15,899",<i>I stand here today deeply saddened</i>
tt0317919,"00:30:16,233","00:30:18,986","by the death of one of God's children,"
tt0317919,"00:30:19,528","00:30:21,822",Lindsey Elizabeth Farris.
tt0317919,"00:30:22,573","00:30:27,369",It is always startling when the Lord takes one of our young so unexpectedly.

tt0317919,"00:30:47,723","00:30:51,977",<i>Identify the target. Point and shoot. It's very simple. You point and shoot.</i>
tt0317919,"00:30:52,102","00:30:53,145",<i>Stay focused.</i>
tt0317919,"00:30:53,270","00:30:56,273","<i>Miss Farris, you know how many recruits I've trained.</i>"

tt0317919,"00:31:11,663","00:31:13,415",<i>Is this Mr Kelvin?</i>
tt0317919,"00:31:16,084","00:31:17,836",Yes. Who is this?
tt0317919,"00:31:18,420","00:31:20,255",<i>I'm calling from Norfolk Mail Service.</i>
tt0317919,"00:31:20,380","00:31:22,799",<i>Lindsey Farris rents a post office box here.</i>
tt0317919,"00:31:22,925","00:31:24,510",<i>She sent you a piece of mail from Berlin</i>
tt0317919,"00:31:24,635","00:31:26,512",<i>and asked us to call you when it arrived.</i>
tt0317919,"00:31:26,637","00:31:28,514",<i>It came this morning.</i>
tt0317919,"00:31:32,851","00:31:34,228",Thank you.
tt0317919,"00:31:38,023","00:31:40,108",- This right here. - Thanks.
tt0317919,"00:31:57,543","00:31:58,877",<i>It's a microdot.</i>
tt0317919,"00:31:58,961","00:32:01,213",A microdot with nothing on it. This is unusual.
tt0317919,"00:32:01,338","00:32:03,340",Lindsey wouldn't send me a blank microdot.
tt0317919,"00:32:03,465","00:32:05,008","I'm telling you, man, there's no image."
tt0317919,"00:32:05,133","00:32:06,426",Then you're not looking in the right place.
tt0317919,"00:32:06,552","00:32:08,011",Where the hell am I supposed to look?
tt0317919,"00:32:08,136","00:32:09,555",There's not much square footage to this thing.
tt0317919,"00:32:09,680","00:32:11,098",Why would Lindsey send me a blank microdot?
tt0317919,"00:32:11,223","00:32:12,975",I don't know. Why would Lindsey send you anything?
tt0317919,"00:32:13,100","00:32:15,769","You were her instructor, not her handler."
tt0317919,"00:32:16,478","00:32:19,481","Listen, man. I don't mean to cross the line,"
tt0317919,"00:32:20,315","00:32:23,527",but was there something going on between you two?
tt0317919,"00:32:23,652","00:32:25,320",You and Lindsey.
tt0317919,"00:32:25,863","00:32:28,365",Lindsey was like my little sister.
tt0317919,"00:32:28,949","00:32:30,409",And you never
tt0317919,"00:32:31,451","00:32:34,246","slept with your little sister, right?"
tt0317919,"00:32:37,291","00:32:40,002","Hey, brother, if I don't ask you, who will?"
tt0317919,"00:32:40,127","00:32:42,629",Maybe it's magnetic. The microdot.
tt0317919,"00:32:43,463","00:32:45,132","Well, that's old school."
tt0317919,"00:32:45,257","00:32:48,719","If she was in a hurry and only had access to black-market gear, maybe."
tt0317919,"00:32:48,844","00:32:51,054",- Could you get the tools to read it? - I might know a guy.
tt0317919,"00:32:51,180","00:32:53,557","- Magnetic means encrypted. - Yeah, I know that."
tt0317919,"00:32:53,682","00:32:56,351",Yeah. Be right there.
tt0317919,"00:32:56,810","00:32:59,646",The thing about Lindsey is she was brand-new.
tt0317919,"00:32:59,771","00:33:02,900",She was sweet. Remember when you were sweet?
tt0317919,"00:33:03,025","00:33:06,528","- Can you remember that far back? - Yeah, well, barely."
tt0317919,"00:33:06,945","00:33:10,407","In Germany, you asked me what it is I see in Julia."
tt0317919,"00:33:10,908","00:33:13,952",What I see in Julia is life before all this.
tt0317919,"00:33:14,745","00:33:16,413",And it's good.
tt0317919,"00:33:18,749","00:33:20,167","Benji, what have you got?"
tt0317919,"00:33:20,292","00:33:22,503","Well, these hard drive platters are just fried."
tt0317919,"00:33:22,628","00:33:24,379","- Yeah. - You know, they made a mess of them."
tt0317919,"00:33:24,505","00:33:25,881",It's just like... There's holes in them and stuff.
tt0317919,"00:33:26,006","00:33:27,883",And it's got scorched all the way through. And then...
tt0317919,"00:33:28,008","00:33:29,551","Look, this one's got a hole in it and stuff."
tt0317919,"00:33:29,676","00:33:30,928",I can't believe. I can't even look at it.
tt0317919,"00:33:31,053","00:33:33,222",- Benji. Did you recover anything? - Yes. Yes.
tt0317919,"00:33:33,347","00:33:36,225","Despite the aforementioned conditions of the hard drive you brought back,"
tt0317919,"00:33:36,350","00:33:40,896",I managed to recover portions of two dozen e-mail files.
tt0317919,"00:33:41,021","00:33:42,523",Also made what I believe to be
tt0317919,"00:33:42,648","00:33:45,609",a thoroughly promotion-worthy breakthrough.
tt0317919,"00:33:46,485","00:33:49,488",Your Mr Davian is going to arrive in Rome the day after tomorrow
tt0317919,"00:33:49,613","00:33:52,658",and attend a function at one Vatican City.
tt0317919,"00:33:52,783","00:33:54,910",What the hell is Davian doing at the Vatican?
tt0317919,"00:33:55,035","00:33:57,037","It's all got to do with the ""Rabbit's Foot."""
tt0317919,"00:33:57,162","00:33:58,247",Rabbit's Foot?
tt0317919,"00:33:58,372","00:34:00,040","Yeah, well, I'm assuming it's like a code word"
tt0317919,"00:34:00,165","00:34:02,292","for something he's about to sell to an unspecified buyer,"
tt0317919,"00:34:02,417","00:34:06,004","for $850 million, by the way. Or maybe it's not a code word."
tt0317919,"00:34:06,129","00:34:08,799","Maybe it's just a really, really expensive bunny appendage."
tt0317919,"00:34:08,924","00:34:10,425",You have no idea what it is?
tt0317919,"00:34:10,551","00:34:13,262","It's interesting. I used to have this professor at Oxford, okay?"
tt0317919,"00:34:13,387","00:34:16,473","Dr Wickham, his name was, and he was like this massive, fat guy."
tt0317919,"00:34:16,598","00:34:18,934","You know, huge, big guy. We used to call him..."
tt0317919,"00:34:19,059","00:34:20,811","You know... Well, I won't tell you what we used to call him."
tt0317919,"00:34:20,936","00:34:23,647","He taught biomolecular kinetics and cellular dynamics,"
tt0317919,"00:34:23,772","00:34:25,774",and he used to sort of scare the underclassmen
tt0317919,"00:34:25,899","00:34:29,027",with this story about how the world would eventually be eviscerated
tt0317919,"00:34:29,153","00:34:30,487",by technology.
tt0317919,"00:34:30,612","00:34:34,074","You see, it was inevitable that a compound would be created,"
tt0317919,"00:34:34,199","00:34:36,702","which he referred to as the ""Anti-God."""
tt0317919,"00:34:36,827","00:34:39,037","It was like an accelerated mutator, a sort of, you know,"
tt0317919,"00:34:39,163","00:34:42,249",like an unstoppable force of destructive power
tt0317919,"00:34:42,374","00:34:44,084",that would just lay waste to everything.
tt0317919,"00:34:44,209","00:34:46,378",To buildings and parks and streets and children
tt0317919,"00:34:46,503","00:34:49,006","and ice cream parlours, you know?"
tt0317919,"00:34:49,214","00:34:51,967","So whenever I see, like, a rogue organisation,"
tt0317919,"00:34:52,092","00:34:55,762","willing to spend this amount of money on a mystery tech,"
tt0317919,"00:34:56,388","00:34:59,224",I always assume it's the Anti-God.
tt0317919,"00:35:00,934","00:35:03,604","End-of-the-world kind of stuff, you know?"
tt0317919,"00:35:05,314","00:35:08,483","But, no, I don't have any idea what it is. I was just speculating."
tt0317919,"00:35:08,609","00:35:10,944","- Did you brief Musgrave on this? - Who, me? No, not yet."
tt0317919,"00:35:11,069","00:35:12,738",- Good. Don't. - What?
tt0317919,"00:35:12,863","00:35:14,573",- Don't tell anyone about this. - This took me ages.

tt0317919,"00:35:16,200","00:35:18,619",I want Musgrave to have deniability.
tt0317919,"00:35:18,744","00:35:21,330","- That's great work, Benji. - What operation?"
tt0317919,"00:35:22,664","00:35:24,583",That look in your eye is a pain in my ass.
tt0317919,"00:35:24,708","00:35:26,585","You know that, right?"

tt0317919,"00:35:43,435","00:35:45,479",I have to go away again.

tt0317919,"00:35:53,779","00:35:54,905",Yeah.
tt0317919,"00:36:01,537","00:36:03,497","Ethan, what's going on?"
tt0317919,"00:36:05,165","00:36:07,709",I keep thinking you just need time

tt0317919,"00:36:17,052","00:36:19,638",But nothing in my mind makes sense.
tt0317919,"00:36:22,349","00:36:23,517",Yeah.
tt0317919,"00:36:27,563","00:36:29,064",What's wrong?
tt0317919,"00:36:37,030","00:36:39,283",What are you not telling me?
tt0317919,"00:37:05,976","00:37:08,228",I need to ask you for something.
tt0317919,"00:37:08,353","00:37:10,772",And it's the most...
tt0317919,"00:37:20,407","00:37:22,034",I need you to trust me.
tt0317919,"00:37:24,745","00:37:26,622",Of course I trust you.
tt0317919,"00:37:31,084","00:37:34,671",Am I ever going to be able to understand what this is?
tt0317919,"00:37:38,133","00:37:40,135",I need you to trust me.

tt0317919,"00:57:07,094","00:57:10,806",Ethan Hunt and his team just grabbed Owen Davian in Rome.
tt0317919,"00:57:10,973","00:57:14,351",They're headed back now. I thought you should know.
tt0317919,"00:57:15,018","00:57:17,271",You were aware of this operation?
tt0317919,"00:57:19,398","00:57:20,774","Yes, I was."
tt0317919,"00:57:21,733","00:57:23,318",Then good work.
tt0317919,"00:57:27,072","00:57:28,407",Thank you.
tt0317919,"00:58:02,691","00:58:04,693","You're dead, Mr Davian."
tt0317919,"00:58:09,448","00:58:11,283",There were witnesses.
tt0317919,"00:58:14,661","00:58:16,872",That was you in the bathroom.
tt0317919,"00:58:16,997","00:58:18,707","Now, you're going to tell us everything."
tt0317919,"00:58:18,832","00:58:21,335",Every buyer you've worked with. Every organisation.
tt0317919,"00:58:21,460","00:58:22,711",What the hell is your name?
tt0317919,"00:58:22,836","00:58:24,963","Names, contacts, inventory lists."
tt0317919,"00:58:25,088","00:58:27,925","You have a wife, girlfriend?"
tt0317919,"00:58:30,344","00:58:32,221",It's up to you how this goes.
tt0317919,"00:58:32,346","00:58:35,224",Because you know what I'm going to do next?
tt0317919,"00:58:35,349","00:58:37,684","I'm going to find her, whoever she is,"
tt0317919,"00:58:37,810","00:58:41,063","I'm going to find her, and I'm going to hurt her."
tt0317919,"00:58:44,775","00:58:46,693",You were apprehended carrying details
tt0317919,"00:58:46,819","00:58:49,822",of the location of something code named the Rabbit's Foot.
tt0317919,"00:58:49,947","00:58:53,659","I'm going to make her bleed, and cry, and call out your name."
tt0317919,"00:58:53,784","00:58:57,496",And you're not going to be able to do shit. You know why?
tt0317919,"00:58:59,039","00:59:00,082",What is the Rabbit's Foot?
tt0317919,"00:59:00,207","00:59:02,459",Because you're going to be this close to dead.
tt0317919,"00:59:02,584","00:59:03,710",And who is the buyer?
tt0317919,"00:59:03,836","00:59:07,339",And then I'm going to kill you right in front of her.
tt0317919,"00:59:08,549","00:59:10,717",- I'm going to ask you one more time. - What's your name?
tt0317919,"00:59:10,843","00:59:12,302",- What is the Rabbit's Foot? - Who are you?
tt0317919,"00:59:12,427","00:59:13,470",And who is the buyer?
tt0317919,"00:59:13,595","00:59:15,931","You don't have any idea what the hell is going on, do you?"
tt0317919,"00:59:16,056","00:59:20,477","I mean, you saw what I did to your little blonde friend at the factory, right?"
tt0317919,"00:59:23,564","00:59:25,983","Well, that was nothing. That was"
tt0317919,"00:59:28,110","00:59:29,236",fun.
tt0317919,"00:59:33,282","00:59:34,741",That was fun.
tt0317919,"01:00:05,772","01:00:07,858",What is the Rabbit's Foot?
tt0317919,"01:00:14,781","01:00:17,284",- Ethan! - What is the Rabbit's Foot?
tt0317919,"01:00:17,784","01:00:19,161","Ethan, stop!"
tt0317919,"01:00:19,286","01:00:20,704",What is it?
tt0317919,"01:00:21,955","01:00:23,415",Don't do it!
tt0317919,"01:00:24,124","01:00:26,627",- Ethan! - What is the Rabbit's Foot?
tt0317919,"01:00:28,712","01:00:29,880",You tell me!
tt0317919,"01:00:30,005","01:00:31,632","Ethan, stop! Don't do it."
tt0317919,"01:00:31,757","01:00:33,926","This isn't you, man! This isn't you!"
tt0317919,"01:00:34,092","01:00:36,803","We can use him, Ethan! You know that!"
tt0317919,"01:00:43,227","01:00:45,187","No, Ethan! Don't do it!"
tt0317919,"01:00:46,939","01:00:48,398","Please, stop!"
tt0317919,"01:01:19,596","01:01:21,265","What I'm selling,"
tt0317919,"01:01:21,974","01:01:23,976","and who I'm selling to,"
tt0317919,"01:01:26,645","01:01:29,857","is the last thing you should be concerned about,"
tt0317919,"01:01:32,359","01:01:33,569",Ethan.
tt0317919,"01:02:31,960","01:02:35,088","Ethan, we got it. Lindsey's microdot."
tt0317919,"01:02:35,589","01:02:37,341",It's a video file.
tt0317919,"01:02:41,678","01:02:44,723","<i>Ethan, I don't know what they've told you. I don't know what you think.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:02:44,848","01:02:46,433",<i>Just listen to me.</i>
tt0317919,"01:02:46,558","01:02:49,061","<i>Brassel sent me to Germany to surveil an exchange,</i>"
tt0317919,"01:02:49,186","01:02:51,230",<i>to ID a man named Owen Davian.</i>
tt0317919,"01:02:51,355","01:02:54,066","<i>I tagged his phone, and I intercepted a transmission.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:02:54,191","01:02:57,528","<i>I traced the call through the IMF network, and this is what came up.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:02:57,653","01:03:00,739",<i>The call to Davian came from Brassel's office.</i>
tt0317919,"01:03:01,615","01:03:04,493",<i>It's Brassel. I think he's working with Davian.</i>
tt0317919,"01:03:04,618","01:03:06,578",<i>I think I'm being set up...</i>
tt0317919,"01:03:20,801","01:03:22,052",Ethan!
tt0317919,"01:03:54,710","01:03:56,211",You all right?
tt0317919,"01:04:03,844","01:04:05,762",Someone call for help!
tt0317919,"01:04:06,847","01:04:09,141",Does anyone have a cell phone?
tt0317919,"01:04:42,674","01:04:44,468","Everybody, get down!"
tt0317919,"01:04:45,052","01:04:48,347","Get down! Get down, get down! Everybody, get down!"
tt0317919,"01:05:04,655","01:05:07,115",- There's a woman down. - I see her.
tt0317919,"01:05:24,633","01:05:26,927",Get down! Get down! Stay down!
tt0317919,"01:05:28,220","01:05:30,806","Everybody, get down! Get down! Stay down!"
tt0317919,"01:05:30,931","01:05:32,266",Get down!
tt0317919,"01:05:35,644","01:05:36,895",Open up!
tt0317919,"01:05:37,020","01:05:39,314",Open up! I need the prisoner!
tt0317919,"01:05:55,455","01:05:56,832","Oh, my God!"
tt0317919,"01:05:57,541","01:05:59,918","It's really bleeding. Don't leave me, okay?"
tt0317919,"01:06:00,043","01:06:01,962",Don't worry. I'm right here.
tt0317919,"01:06:02,087","01:06:04,423","Ethan, there's a G36 in the truck!"
tt0317919,"01:06:04,548","01:06:05,632",I know! I know!
tt0317919,"01:06:36,038","01:06:38,916",Turn the drone around. There's an IMF agent in the truck.
tt0317919,"01:06:46,798","01:06:49,009",Ethan! Get out of the truck!
tt0317919,"01:06:56,475","01:06:57,893","Ethan, move!"
tt0317919,"01:09:08,357","01:09:10,734","- Hello? - Rick, this is Ethan. Is Julia home?"
tt0317919,"01:09:10,859","01:09:13,946","Hey, man. Look, I hope you're not mad I'm here. It's just..."
tt0317919,"01:09:14,071","01:09:15,364","Rick, I'm not mad. Is Julia home?"
tt0317919,"01:09:15,489","01:09:17,407","I tried her cell phone, and there was no answer."
tt0317919,"01:09:17,991","01:09:21,578","No. Sorry. Hey, did your friend find you?"
tt0317919,"01:09:23,372","01:09:24,790",Which friend?
tt0317919,"01:09:24,915","01:09:27,501",<i>I don't know. Just some English guy.</i>
tt0317919,"01:09:29,837","01:09:31,171","Rick, what did you tell him?"
tt0317919,"01:09:31,296","01:09:34,132","<i>Look, it's all good, man. I told him I didn't know where you were,</i>"
tt0317919,"01:09:34,258","01:09:37,719","<i>and Julia might, and he should just try her at the hospital.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:09:39,429","01:09:40,597",Hello?
tt0317919,"01:09:46,645","01:09:49,231","- All right, see you tomorrow, Sally. - All right. Good night, honey."
tt0317919,"01:09:56,822","01:09:59,199",<i>Hi. It's Julia. Please leave me a message...</i>
tt0317919,"01:10:06,790","01:10:10,752","<i>...at 4:00 today, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge is closed in both directions.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:10:10,878","01:10:12,671","- Sixth floor. - Sally, this is Ethan."
tt0317919,"01:10:12,796","01:10:14,840","- I need to talk to Julia. <i>- Hey, honey.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:10:14,965","01:10:16,675",She just went downstairs. I'll transfer you.
tt0317919,"01:10:37,654","01:10:38,864",Damn it!
tt0317919,"01:10:39,740","01:10:40,782",Excuse me.
tt0317919,"01:10:40,908","01:10:43,243",I was wondering if you knew where I might find this patient.
tt0317919,"01:10:43,368","01:10:45,954",Probably not. But I'll know who can.
tt0317919,"01:10:51,251","01:10:52,711",What's that?
tt0317919,"01:11:08,018","01:11:09,937",Sally. Where's Julia?
tt0317919,"01:11:10,479","01:11:12,856",- Where's Julia? - I think she left.
tt0317919,"01:11:12,981","01:11:15,192",Have you tried the east building?
tt0317919,"01:11:21,740","01:11:23,659",- Has Julia left yet? - I haven't seen her.
tt0317919,"01:11:23,784","01:11:25,994","- Mike, Mike. Have you seen Julia? - Hey, you okay?"
tt0317919,"01:11:26,119","01:11:27,663",- Have you seen Julia? - No.
tt0317919,"01:11:32,167","01:11:34,002","Watch it, buddy!"
tt0317919,"01:11:44,680","01:11:47,266",- Jules? <i>- You hung me outside of an aeroplane.</i>
tt0317919,"01:11:47,391","01:11:49,184",<i>You can always tell someone's character</i>
tt0317919,"01:11:49,309","01:11:51,812",<i>by the way they treat those they don't need to treat well.</i>
tt0317919,"01:11:51,937","01:11:55,816","- If you hurt her, I swear... <i>- Don't threaten me. Just don't.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:11:55,941","01:11:59,778","<i>The briefcase I picked up in Rome, the one you took from me,</i>"
tt0317919,"01:11:59,903","01:12:01,989",<i>contains the location of the Rabbit's Foot.</i>
tt0317919,"01:12:02,114","01:12:05,492",<i>You're going to get it and bring it to me. The Rabbit's Foot.</i>
tt0317919,"01:12:05,617","01:12:08,495","<i>Ethan, you had a watch last time I saw you.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:12:08,620","01:12:11,373","<i>You have 48 hours, starting on my mark.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:12:11,498","01:12:12,708","Wait, wait, wait."
tt0317919,"01:12:12,833","01:12:14,877","<i>Now, call me at this number when you have it.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:12:15,002","01:12:17,713",- Just wait. <i>- Julia's life for the Rabbit's Foot.</i>
tt0317919,"01:12:17,838","01:12:21,216","<i>- You have 48 hours, or she dies.</i> - Wait! Wait. Wait."
tt0317919,"01:12:25,929","01:12:28,223",<i>Condition 1-116. All units on scene.</i>
tt0317919,"01:12:28,348","01:12:30,267",We need you to come with us.
tt0317919,"01:12:30,392","01:12:32,728","Just... Pete, what the hell is this?"
tt0317919,"01:12:32,853","01:12:35,522","Sorry about that, Mr Hunt. We were told to bring you in."
tt0317919,"01:12:35,647","01:12:37,774",- Okay. <i>- Get ready to transport.</i>
tt0317919,"01:12:37,900","01:12:39,651",Whoa. Hey. Just not right now.
tt0317919,"01:12:39,776","01:12:42,154",- Just tell them you came and that... - Ethan. Get in.
tt0317919,"01:12:42,279","01:12:45,616","We don't want to use force here, and you know we will. Ethan, get in."
tt0317919,"01:12:45,741","01:12:47,993",- Tell them that you came here... - Ethan!
tt0317919,"01:12:48,118","01:12:50,204","...and that I left already, okay?"
tt0317919,"01:12:55,125","01:12:56,335",Freeze!
tt0317919,"01:12:56,627","01:12:59,755","Ethan, stop! Stop, Ethan!"
tt0317919,"01:13:13,811","01:13:15,604",Yeah. Get his hands.
tt0317919,"01:13:43,465","01:13:46,426",I reviewed the transcript of your Berlin operation.
tt0317919,"01:13:46,552","01:13:48,428",It's very interesting.
tt0317919,"01:13:48,554","01:13:50,597",It seems that Agent Farris had some information
tt0317919,"01:13:50,722","01:13:53,934",she wished to share with you but not with this agency.
tt0317919,"01:13:54,059","01:13:55,811",Something you failed to report.
tt0317919,"01:13:55,936","01:13:59,106",You ordered the Vatican operation without proper approvals.
tt0317919,"01:13:59,231","01:14:01,650",That mission resulted in a catastrophic attack.
tt0317919,"01:14:01,775","01:14:03,652",And then you fled the scene.
tt0317919,"01:14:03,777","01:14:06,864","Now, I am not a stranger to disrespect."
tt0317919,"01:14:07,698","01:14:10,534",You don't get to where I am without developing a thick skin.
tt0317919,"01:14:10,659","01:14:12,828","But what I won't stand for,"
tt0317919,"01:14:13,203","01:14:16,456","what I will lose sleep over, and I love my sleep,"
tt0317919,"01:14:16,790","01:14:20,502",is the idea of an irresponsible rogue agent working in my office.
tt0317919,"01:14:20,627","01:14:24,381",So I'm going to slow things way down here.
tt0317919,"01:14:28,010","01:14:29,470",You can look at me
tt0317919,"01:14:29,595","01:14:32,764","with those judgemental, incriminating eyes all you want,"
tt0317919,"01:14:32,890","01:14:34,558",but I bullshit you not.
tt0317919,"01:14:34,683","01:14:38,479",I will bleed on the flag to make sure the stripes stay red.
tt0317919,"01:14:57,539","01:14:59,833",I don't know what to say to you.
tt0317919,"01:15:01,043","01:15:03,795",Brassel's right. You're out of control.
tt0317919,"01:15:05,130","01:15:06,548",Look at me.
tt0317919,"01:15:08,342","01:15:12,638","Ethan, at least show me the courtesy of looking at me when I'm talking to you."
tt0317919,"01:15:21,271","01:15:25,484",I intercepted Davian's call. I know he wants the Rabbit's Foot for Julia's life.
tt0317919,"01:15:25,609","01:15:27,069",It's just...
tt0317919,"01:15:29,488","01:15:30,697",This is
tt0317919,"01:15:31,532","01:15:33,242",<i>so disappointing.</i>
tt0317919,"01:15:33,951","01:15:37,329",Go to Shanghai. Feng Shan Apartments... 1406.
tt0317919,"01:15:42,251","01:15:45,963","I wish there was something I could do to help you, but..."
tt0317919,"01:15:51,385","01:15:53,220",Take him to the holding cell.
tt0317919,"01:17:07,085","01:17:08,504","No, I'm on it."
tt0317919,"01:17:08,629","01:17:10,714","Yes, sir. There's no need to panic. I'll get him back."
tt0317919,"01:17:10,839","01:17:11,882",Sir? Ethan Hunt...
tt0317919,"01:17:12,007","01:17:13,342",I know what happened. Give me the radio.
tt0317919,"01:17:13,467","01:17:16,261",This is Director Brassel. Ethan Hunt is attempting to escape the building.
tt0317919,"01:17:16,386","01:17:18,347",He's in the west cargo elevator. He must be stopped.
tt0317919,"01:17:18,472","01:17:21,225",I want Mendoza and Graham in the situation room right away.
tt0317919,"01:17:21,350","01:17:23,060","I'm having the building surrounded, sir."
tt0317919,"01:17:23,185","01:17:24,853",I've got units posted at all the entrances.
tt0317919,"01:17:24,978","01:17:28,232",<i>This is Brassel again. I'm ordering a code-six lockdown. I repeat.</i>
tt0317919,"01:17:28,357","01:17:30,651",- It's Hunt. - I know it's Hunt.
tt0317919,"01:17:32,444","01:17:35,155",Hunt was flagged on sub-basement nine.
tt0317919,"01:17:35,280","01:17:38,575",I want all security personnel down there now.
tt0317919,"01:17:39,117","01:17:40,744",Security channel's jammed.
tt0317919,"01:17:40,869","01:17:43,956",Hunt must be holding down the transmit button.
tt0317919,"01:18:07,521","01:18:08,856",You've got to be kidding me.
tt0317919,"01:18:20,033","01:18:24,371","<i>Last call for flight 1162 for Helsinki, now boarding at gate 46.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:18:27,416","01:18:30,085",<i>Final call for Mr Bower. Final call for Mr Bower.</i>
tt0317919,"01:18:30,210","01:18:31,795",<i>Please come to gate 4.</i>
tt0317919,"01:18:32,671","01:18:35,549",- Mr Pavel Sobo... Sobotka. - Sobotka.
tt0317919,"01:18:35,674","01:18:38,719",Sobotka. Okay. And you're flying to Shanghai?
tt0317919,"01:18:42,222","01:18:45,893",I don't speak Czech. I'm sorry. Let's see about your flight.
tt0317919,"01:18:46,018","01:18:47,186",Okay.
tt0317919,"01:18:47,311","01:18:49,146",- Okay. - Okay.
tt0317919,"01:20:27,578","01:20:29,079",Don't kill me.
tt0317919,"01:20:30,622","01:20:31,957",I'm sorry.
tt0317919,"01:20:33,333","01:20:34,668",I'm sorry.
tt0317919,"01:20:36,420","01:20:39,965",Musgrave told us about Julia. We're here to help.
tt0317919,"01:20:40,090","01:20:42,176","To get your wife, you'll need the Rabbit's Foot."
tt0317919,"01:20:42,301","01:20:44,303","According to the plans from Davian's briefcase,"
tt0317919,"01:20:44,428","01:20:47,890",it's in a laboratory on the 56th floor of the Hengshan Lu Building.
tt0317919,"01:20:48,015","01:20:49,850",Which is a nightmare for just about every reason.
tt0317919,"01:20:49,975","01:20:53,437","They're a Chinese military contractor. We have no pull, no details."
tt0317919,"01:20:53,729","01:20:55,522","The good news is, whatever it is,"
tt0317919,"01:20:55,647","01:20:57,900","the Rabbit Foot's small, so we can steal it."
tt0317919,"01:20:58,025","01:21:00,694","The bad news, we got to steal it."
tt0317919,"01:21:01,570","01:21:04,239","From a thief's point of view, this is worst-case scenario."
tt0317919,"01:21:04,364","01:21:06,533",The security guards are all privately-contracted
tt0317919,"01:21:06,658","01:21:07,993",former People's Liberation Army.
tt0317919,"01:21:08,118","01:21:10,370",The only access to the lab is by private elevator.
tt0317919,"01:21:10,496","01:21:13,123",And that can only be activated by persons inside the lab.
tt0317919,"01:21:13,248","01:21:16,084",All of it surveilled by security cameras within the building.
tt0317919,"01:21:16,210","01:21:18,045",What about the roof?
tt0317919,"01:21:19,004","01:21:21,757",Four guards full time. Two on each rooftop.
tt0317919,"01:21:21,882","01:21:23,634",Langley was a cakewalk compared to this.
tt0317919,"01:21:23,759","01:21:25,302",That's the one.
tt0317919,"01:21:26,220","01:21:28,138",- How tall is that building? - Why?
tt0317919,"01:21:28,263","01:21:30,557",It's 162 metres at the highest point.
tt0317919,"01:21:30,682","01:21:33,101","What about that, the building on the left? How tall is that one?"
tt0317919,"01:21:33,227","01:21:34,686",Says 226 metres.
tt0317919,"01:21:34,812","01:21:37,439",226. Distance between the buildings?
tt0317919,"01:21:37,564","01:21:39,358",47.55 metres across.
tt0317919,"01:21:55,999","01:21:57,167",Ethan?
tt0317919,"01:21:57,918","01:22:00,671",That's good. I think it's tall enough.
tt0317919,"01:22:01,880","01:22:04,299",- For what? - A fulcrum.
tt0317919,"01:22:06,426","01:22:09,096","Oh, you're gonna swing... No, no, no, no. Wait, wait."
tt0317919,"01:22:09,221","01:22:11,598","- You could bounce right off the roof. - Yes, I could."
tt0317919,"01:22:11,723","01:22:13,851","Even if you made it to the rooftop, took out the guards,"
tt0317919,"01:22:13,976","01:22:17,563","and got the Rabbit's Foot, you can't just walk out of the lobby. What's your exit?"
tt0317919,"01:22:17,688","01:22:19,314",Base-jump off the top. I need a chute.
tt0317919,"01:22:19,439","01:22:21,608","Even at 162, you're pushing minimum height for a jump."
tt0317919,"01:22:21,733","01:22:23,277",Chute opens any lower than that and you're dead.
tt0317919,"01:22:23,402","01:22:24,444",What are you going to do?
tt0317919,"01:22:24,570","01:22:26,655",Land in the middle of Shanghai and hope no one notices?
tt0317919,"01:22:26,780","01:22:28,031",Central Park's two blocks away.
tt0317919,"01:22:28,157","01:22:30,033","Wait, wait, Ethan, I'm not saying I have a better idea,"
tt0317919,"01:22:30,159","01:22:32,578",but there's a point where bold becomes stupid.
tt0317919,"01:22:32,703","01:22:35,164","Now, we don't even know what this thing is, and you're talking"
tt0317919,"01:22:35,289","01:22:38,125",about handing it over to a guy who provides terrorists with information.
tt0317919,"01:22:38,250","01:22:40,335","Luther, of course I'm not suggesting that we just hand it over."
tt0317919,"01:22:40,460","01:22:43,297",We're going to tag the Rabbit's Foot so we can trace it and know where it is.
tt0317919,"01:22:43,422","01:22:46,300","Now, you know we can get that gear here. I just deliver it myself."
tt0317919,"01:22:46,425","01:22:49,261","We contact Musgrave, have the IMF trace a tag, order a raid,"
tt0317919,"01:22:49,386","01:22:51,138","get the Rabbit's Foot back, grab Davian."
tt0317919,"01:22:51,263","01:22:53,974","Now, if I get out with Julia, we win."
tt0317919,"01:22:55,100","01:22:56,852","If I don't, then..."
tt0317919,"01:23:03,275","01:23:06,153","Look, then she's dead anyway. And so am I."
tt0317919,"01:23:07,362","01:23:08,655",You know?
tt0317919,"01:23:08,780","01:23:13,118","Goddamn it, it's 8:11, it's 8:12."
tt0317919,"01:23:15,621","01:23:18,749",And we have two hours before they kill my wife.
tt0317919,"01:23:19,666","01:23:21,376",Are you in or not?
tt0317919,"01:23:28,967","01:23:30,677",Of course we're in.
tt0317919,"01:24:03,001","01:24:04,753",You got 18 minutes.
tt0317919,"01:24:07,172","01:24:09,049",You're going to make it over there.
tt0317919,"01:24:09,174","01:24:12,511","You're going to find the Rabbit's Foot, get back to the roof,"
tt0317919,"01:24:12,636","01:24:14,429","radio me when you're ready to make the jump,"
tt0317919,"01:24:14,555","01:24:16,974",and we're going to come get you.
tt0317919,"01:24:17,975","01:24:19,726",Thank you for coming.
tt0317919,"01:24:20,477","01:24:21,937",That's my job.
tt0317919,"01:24:58,265","01:24:59,600",Batter up.
tt0317919,"01:25:27,377","01:25:30,422","Oh, yeah. They're freaking out. Hit them again."
tt0317919,"01:27:05,309","01:27:06,435",Okay.
tt0317919,"01:27:07,978","01:27:08,979",<i>He made it.</i>
tt0317919,"01:27:09,188","01:27:10,564",He made it.
tt0317919,"01:27:13,692","01:27:15,444",I knew he'd make it.
tt0317919,"01:27:30,000","01:27:32,920",I'm going in. I'll be out in five minutes.
tt0317919,"01:27:41,094","01:27:43,472",- It's been 12 minutes. - He's got five minutes left.
tt0317919,"01:27:43,597","01:27:47,017","If he doesn't call Davian in five minutes, Julia's dead."
tt0317919,"01:27:47,142","01:27:48,477",<i>Anything?</i>
tt0317919,"01:27:50,062","01:27:51,063",Negative.
tt0317919,"01:27:51,188","01:27:53,315",<i>How about you? Any good news?</i>
tt0317919,"01:27:53,440","01:27:54,858","No, nothing."
tt0317919,"01:27:55,025","01:27:56,527","Come on, Ethan."
tt0317919,"01:28:05,828","01:28:07,287",What is that?
tt0317919,"01:28:12,459","01:28:16,755","When I was little I had a cat, and he used to run away all the time."
tt0317919,"01:28:18,257","01:28:21,385",And it's just a prayer I'd say to bring him home.
tt0317919,"01:28:23,345","01:28:24,847",Teach it to me.
tt0317919,"01:28:26,640","01:28:28,809","<i>I've got the Rabbit's Foot, but I can't make it to the roof.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:28:28,934","01:28:31,728",What the hell do you mean you can't make it to the roof? Where are you?
tt0317919,"01:28:31,854","01:28:33,897","<i>Look up! Look up, look up!</i>"
tt0317919,"01:28:36,775","01:28:38,944","- Oh, shit. - He's way too low."
tt0317919,"01:30:29,721","01:30:32,724",- Ethan! Get in! They're coming! - Who?
tt0317919,"01:30:32,850","01:30:35,477","Building security, and they're pissed."
tt0317919,"01:30:38,105","01:30:39,940","Okay. Go, go, go, go."
tt0317919,"01:30:46,822","01:30:48,907",How much time you got left?
tt0317919,"01:30:49,199","01:30:50,993",Less than two minutes.
tt0317919,"01:30:57,332","01:31:00,460",You gotta get us out of here. I lost the signal.
tt0317919,"01:31:03,172","01:31:04,923",- You okay? - Not yet.
tt0317919,"01:31:13,307","01:31:14,433",Come on. Come on.
tt0317919,"01:31:21,857","01:31:23,442",I don't have a signal. I don't have a signal.
tt0317919,"01:31:23,567","01:31:24,776",I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it!
tt0317919,"01:31:33,243","01:31:34,328",Zhen!
tt0317919,"01:31:36,455","01:31:38,081",Damn it. I'm sorry.
tt0317919,"01:31:46,340","01:31:48,008",Put pressure on it.
tt0317919,"01:31:48,509","01:31:51,637",- Tell me when you get a signal. - What are you doing?
tt0317919,"01:32:10,739","01:32:12,282",I got a signal!
tt0317919,"01:32:16,620","01:32:17,913",Hit redial.
tt0317919,"01:32:20,082","01:32:22,751",<i>You only had five seconds left. Do you realise that?</i>
tt0317919,"01:32:22,876","01:32:25,170",The Rabbit's Foot. I have it.
tt0317919,"01:32:25,546","01:32:29,550",<i>The train yard at Dunan Zhong Lu. Wait for me there. Alone.</i>
tt0317919,"01:32:32,845","01:32:34,304",- Yeah? <i>- Go secure.</i>
tt0317919,"01:32:34,429","01:32:35,639",We are.
tt0317919,"01:32:36,765","01:32:38,767",<i>I have the Rabbit's Foot.</i>
tt0317919,"01:32:38,892","01:32:41,103",- You okay? - I'm tagging it now.
tt0317919,"01:32:44,106","01:32:46,441",You need to run a trace. Make sure we have eyes on this thing.
tt0317919,"01:32:46,567","01:32:49,528",- What's the tag? - 6-3-9-6-4-1.
tt0317919,"01:32:50,487","01:32:51,655",Got it.
tt0317919,"01:32:54,408","01:32:55,701",I see you on Luang Tao Lu Road.
tt0317919,"01:32:55,826","01:32:59,329","If you don't hear from me in eight hours, you send an army after this thing."
tt0317919,"01:32:59,454","01:33:01,290","- Good luck. - You, too."
tt0317919,"01:33:08,714","01:33:10,507",<i>- Mr Musgrave. - Yeah.</i>
tt0317919,"01:33:10,757","01:33:12,801",<i>It's come to my attention that yesterday afternoon</i>
tt0317919,"01:33:12,926","01:33:14,428",<i>you sent a team to the Far East.</i>
tt0317919,"01:33:15,053","01:33:17,097",We received intel that Hadaam Saleen Bahar
tt0317919,"01:33:17,222","01:33:18,474",was en route to Shanghai.
tt0317919,"01:33:18,599","01:33:20,893",- Hadaam Saleen Bahar. - That's right.
tt0317919,"01:33:21,018","01:33:22,936",You know what I'd love? I'd love to see that intel.
tt0317919,"01:33:23,061","01:33:25,481","- I'll be in my office. - Yes, sir."
tt0317919,"01:33:38,035","01:33:39,536",Thanks again.
tt0317919,"01:33:39,953","01:33:41,914",I'll see you back home.
tt0317919,"01:33:42,831","01:33:44,041",Ethan.
tt0317919,"01:33:45,250","01:33:48,212",You know they probably plan to kill you both.
tt0317919,"01:33:49,922","01:33:52,216",Then I won't see you back home.
tt0317919,"01:33:53,801","01:33:55,344",Better get back.
tt0317919,"01:34:42,349","01:34:44,726",Drink it. No questions.
tt0317919,"01:35:48,332","01:35:49,708",Good morning.
tt0317919,"01:36:05,641","01:36:06,767",Jules.
tt0317919,"01:36:07,976","01:36:10,813",We've put an explosive charge in your head.
tt0317919,"01:36:10,938","01:36:12,981",Does that sound familiar?
tt0317919,"01:36:13,732","01:36:16,026",The Rabbit's Foot. Where is it?
tt0317919,"01:36:16,777","01:36:18,445",I gave it to you.
tt0317919,"01:36:19,029","01:36:21,240","Now, I'm going to count to 10"
tt0317919,"01:36:21,365","01:36:24,993",and you're going to tell me where the Rabbit's Foot is
tt0317919,"01:36:26,411","01:36:27,788",or she dies.
tt0317919,"01:36:52,980","01:36:56,316",Seems we have a lot to talk about. Don't we?
tt0317919,"01:36:59,153","01:37:01,071",- Do you think I'm playing? - Son of a bitch!
tt0317919,"01:37:01,196","01:37:03,907",Do you think I'm playing? You don't think I'll do it?
tt0317919,"01:37:04,032","01:37:05,075",Where is it?
tt0317919,"01:37:05,200","01:37:06,535",- Look at me. - Where the hell is it?
tt0317919,"01:37:06,660","01:37:07,911",- Look at me. Stay with me. - Seven!
tt0317919,"01:37:08,036","01:37:10,247",I am going to kill you. I swear to God I'm going to...
tt0317919,"01:37:10,372","01:37:12,207","- Eight! - No, please."
tt0317919,"01:37:14,042","01:37:17,546",Please. Don't do this. Just let her go.
tt0317919,"01:37:18,172","01:37:21,175",I promise you. I promise you.
tt0317919,"01:37:21,550","01:37:24,219",- I can figure out how to get whatever... - Nine.
tt0317919,"01:37:25,262","01:37:28,182",Listen to me. I want to help you get whatever you want.
tt0317919,"01:37:28,307","01:37:31,852",But you got to do what's right. What you know is right.
tt0317919,"01:37:32,769","01:37:34,229","No, please..."
tt0317919,"01:37:36,899","01:37:37,941",No.
tt0317919,"01:37:40,194","01:37:41,195",No.
tt0317919,"01:37:41,570","01:37:43,280",- Ten. - Don't!
tt0317919,"01:38:00,130","01:38:03,759",I pushed him as far as he can go. I know he's not lying.
tt0317919,"01:38:04,092","01:38:05,594",I understand.
tt0317919,"01:38:06,220","01:38:09,389",I've got some questions I want to ask him first.
tt0317919,"01:38:31,829","01:38:33,455",It's complicated.
tt0317919,"01:38:40,379","01:38:42,589",You can't just open the canister.
tt0317919,"01:38:42,714","01:38:45,551",We had to make sure you brought the real thing.
tt0317919,"01:38:45,676","01:38:48,971",The Rabbit's Foot. Now we know.
tt0317919,"01:38:57,771","01:39:00,983",Don't you touch her! Don't you touch her!
tt0317919,"01:39:10,242","01:39:13,662","Davian's translator, his Head of Security."
tt0317919,"01:39:14,997","01:39:18,125",Remember? At the Vatican she failed him.
tt0317919,"01:39:20,502","01:39:24,673","Ethan, Julia is still alive."
tt0317919,"01:39:25,507","01:39:29,344","Davian wanted to kill you both, but I convinced him otherwise."
tt0317919,"01:39:29,470","01:39:33,307",Julia hasn't seen me. She doesn't know anything. She's clean.
tt0317919,"01:39:33,474","01:39:35,767",She can go on to have a life.
tt0317919,"01:39:36,185","01:39:40,731","As long as you tell me, what was in Lindsey's message?"
tt0317919,"01:39:41,732","01:39:44,568",I know she sent you a microdot from Berlin.
tt0317919,"01:39:45,986","01:39:48,447",Did Lindsey know about me and Davian?
tt0317919,"01:39:48,572","01:39:51,492",Is that why she sent the message to you? Did you read it?
tt0317919,"01:39:51,617","01:39:53,243",Did anyone else see it?
tt0317919,"01:39:53,368","01:39:55,621",Did she know about the work I was doing?
tt0317919,"01:39:55,746","01:39:57,706",Could I be compromised at IMF?
tt0317919,"01:39:57,831","01:39:59,458",Ethan. Ethan.
tt0317919,"01:40:00,918","01:40:03,253",Did she buy that Brassel set her up?
tt0317919,"01:40:03,378","01:40:05,088",Did she buy that?
tt0317919,"01:40:06,381","01:40:07,800",You told him.
tt0317919,"01:40:09,176","01:40:11,637",That's how Davian knew Lindsey was coming.
tt0317919,"01:40:11,762","01:40:13,347",You told him.
tt0317919,"01:40:15,307","01:40:17,559",I thought you could get her back.
tt0317919,"01:40:17,684","01:40:21,271","But I wasn't gonna let Brassel, of all people, undo the work I'd done."
tt0317919,"01:40:21,396","01:40:25,818","I took action, Ethan, on behalf of the working families of our country."
tt0317919,"01:40:25,943","01:40:27,319","The Armed Forces, the White House."
tt0317919,"01:40:27,444","01:40:29,363",I'd had enough of Brassel and his sanctimony.
tt0317919,"01:40:29,488","01:40:32,783",IMF Executive Director. He's an affirmative action poster boy.
tt0317919,"01:40:32,908","01:40:36,370","You grab Davian like he wanted, then what?"
tt0317919,"01:40:36,954","01:40:38,580",Davian's a weed.
tt0317919,"01:40:40,290","01:40:44,336","You cut him out, two more spring up just like him the next day."
tt0317919,"01:40:44,545","01:40:46,421",Arrest him? Then what?
tt0317919,"01:40:47,881","01:40:49,258",You use him.
tt0317919,"01:40:50,759","01:40:53,387",Collaborate with him.
tt0317919,"01:40:54,888","01:40:56,890",And it's Christmas.
tt0317919,"01:40:58,725","01:41:01,645","In 18 hours, the Rabbit's Foot will be delivered"
tt0317919,"01:41:01,770","01:41:05,023","to its Middle Eastern buyer, and we'll have credible intel to prove it."
tt0317919,"01:41:05,149","01:41:07,985",US Security Council will get a report by this time tomorrow.
tt0317919,"01:41:08,110","01:41:11,155",We're talking a military strike within a week.
tt0317919,"01:41:11,572","01:41:13,615","And when the sand settles,"
tt0317919,"01:41:14,116","01:41:16,577",our country will do what it does best.
tt0317919,"01:41:16,702","01:41:19,371",Clean up. Infrastructure.
tt0317919,"01:41:21,123","01:41:22,708",Democracy wins.
tt0317919,"01:41:27,087","01:41:29,923",What was Lindsey's message?
tt0317919,"01:41:30,966","01:41:34,261","You tell me, and Julia walks."
tt0317919,"01:41:36,847","01:41:39,308",It's the only play you have left.
tt0317919,"01:41:40,684","01:41:44,062","Not till I hear her voice, know she's alive."
tt0317919,"01:41:46,231","01:41:47,524",Of course.
tt0317919,"01:42:00,662","01:42:01,997",Put her on.
tt0317919,"01:42:09,630","01:42:11,297",- Jules? <i>- Ethan?</i>
tt0317919,"01:42:11,298","01:42:11,757",- Jules? <i>- Ethan?</i>
tt0317919,"01:42:12,049","01:42:15,302","When we met, there was a lake near the mountain."
tt0317919,"01:42:17,513","01:42:19,473",What was the lake called?
tt0317919,"01:42:20,808","01:42:22,017",<i>Wanaka.</i>
tt0317919,"01:42:22,643","01:42:24,186","<i>Please, Ethan.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:42:24,394","01:42:26,939","- Jules. <i>- Ethan, I don't understand...</i>"
tt0317919,"01:42:46,333","01:42:47,835",Benjamin Dunne.
tt0317919,"01:42:48,585","01:42:49,628","Benji, it's me."
tt0317919,"01:42:49,753","01:42:52,798",<i>- Ethan.</i> - What? No. Really?
tt0317919,"01:42:52,923","01:42:54,591",<i>Listen to me very carefully. I need your help.</i>
tt0317919,"01:42:56,301","01:42:59,513",I need to trace the location of the last call made from this phone.
tt0317919,"01:42:59,638","01:43:01,265","Look, no. Ethan. Shush."
tt0317919,"01:43:01,390","01:43:03,100",<i>They're looking... Everyone's looking for you.</i>
tt0317919,"01:43:03,225","01:43:06,270",<i>Everyone I know. They're looking... I just looked it up.</i>
tt0317919,"01:43:06,395","01:43:08,188","<i>Okay, you're on Interpol's most wanted list.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:43:08,313","01:43:10,774","And that, by the way, is a spectacular list to be on."
tt0317919,"01:43:10,899","01:43:13,318","<i>Whatever happened, I'm sorry, but I'm hanging up now right now.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:43:13,443","01:43:14,653","Benji, I don't have time for this."
tt0317919,"01:43:14,778","01:43:16,405",What do you think happened? I've been set up.
tt0317919,"01:43:16,530","01:43:19,575",I think I like my job. Okay? A lot.
tt0317919,"01:43:19,700","01:43:21,535",All right? And you know they're gonna be taping this call.
tt0317919,"01:43:21,869","01:43:24,580",And you know you can erase it. I'm giving you the number right now.
tt0317919,"01:43:24,705","01:43:26,790",- Are you ready? - All right. Just hang on.
tt0317919,"01:43:26,915","01:43:29,251","I'm gonna lose my citizenship because of this, you know."
tt0317919,"01:43:29,376","01:43:32,212",7-3-4-4-2-5-6-4-3-6-7.
tt0317919,"01:43:32,337","01:43:35,090","Okay. Wait. Okay. Hold the line, please."
tt0317919,"01:43:49,438","01:43:51,023",- Are you there? - Yeah.
tt0317919,"01:43:51,148","01:43:52,357",<i>Okay.</i>
tt0317919,"01:43:53,066","01:43:56,195","<i>Maybe we can share a jail cell together, you know?</i>"
tt0317919,"01:43:56,320","01:43:58,864","If this all goes tits up, which it will."
tt0317919,"01:43:58,989","01:44:00,782",The location of that number is Shanghai.
tt0317919,"01:44:00,908","01:44:02,159","There, I just told you. Shanghai."
tt0317919,"01:44:02,284","01:44:04,870",I've just aided and abetted an enemy of the state. Fantastic. Thank you.
tt0317919,"01:44:04,995","01:44:07,289",Am I close? Use this phone to track my location.
tt0317919,"01:44:07,414","01:44:09,792","Oh, you're there. Well, you're close."
tt0317919,"01:44:09,917","01:44:11,668",How close? Is the signal in the building?
tt0317919,"01:44:11,794","01:44:13,212","No, no, no. It isn't coming from there."
tt0317919,"01:44:13,337","01:44:15,130",It's in a building one mile to the northeast.
tt0317919,"01:44:15,255","01:44:16,840","<i>Benji, lead me to the signal.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:44:29,394","01:44:32,898",<i>There is one thing. What the hell are you doing in Shanghai?</i>
tt0317919,"01:44:33,023","01:44:35,192",I'll tell you when I see you.
tt0317919,"01:44:43,742","01:44:45,994",What you... You need to go north.
tt0317919,"01:44:46,119","01:44:48,455","Okay, there's a bridge. Get to it, cross it."
tt0317919,"01:44:48,580","01:44:51,917",<i>Make a left. Go three-quarters of a mile along the river.</i>
tt0317919,"01:44:52,042","01:44:53,836",I got it. I got it.
tt0317919,"01:45:29,246","01:45:31,165","Good, good. That's right. Keep going. Keep going."
tt0317919,"01:45:31,290","01:45:32,666",Make your next left and then the next one.
tt0317919,"01:45:32,791","01:45:34,376","And then follow that down 1,000 yards."
tt0317919,"01:45:34,501","01:45:36,170",A thousand yards.
tt0317919,"01:45:36,545","01:45:39,423","- Okay. Okay, okay. <i>- Okay, okay. Left. Left.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:45:40,007","01:45:42,092","Yeah, that's good. That's good. Keep going. Keep going."
tt0317919,"01:45:42,217","01:45:44,344","Okay, now look... Hiya. Hi."
tt0317919,"01:45:44,470","01:45:45,929","<i>Benji, where?</i>"
tt0317919,"01:45:46,054","01:45:48,307",<i>- Benji? Which way do I go?</i> - Now take a right.
tt0317919,"01:45:55,063","01:45:56,523","Okay. Go down, left."
tt0317919,"01:45:56,940","01:45:58,775",Left? I'm going left.
tt0317919,"01:46:00,694","01:46:01,778","<i>Good, good.</i>"
tt0317919,"01:46:01,904","01:46:03,614",It's in the second building on your left.
tt0317919,"01:46:03,739","01:46:06,074",The signal bearing's plus or minus three metres
tt0317919,"01:46:06,200","01:46:07,326",from the northeast corner.
tt0317919,"01:46:07,868","01:46:09,119",I owe you.
tt0317919,"01:48:06,403","01:48:08,322",Jules. Jules.
tt0317919,"01:48:08,989","01:48:10,616",You're gonna be okay.
tt0317919,"01:48:13,660","01:48:14,912","Oh, God!"
tt0317919,"01:48:15,454","01:48:16,497",God!
tt0317919,"01:48:27,174","01:48:29,593",I've activated the charge in your head.
tt0317919,"01:48:35,098","01:48:37,559",You have maybe four minutes left.
tt0317919,"01:48:47,069","01:48:49,738",Didn't I tell you she'd call out your name?
tt0317919,"01:48:55,869","01:48:58,831",Ethan. Ethan.
tt0317919,"01:49:02,960","01:49:04,044",No.
tt0317919,"01:49:08,924","01:49:10,217",Please.
tt0317919,"01:49:15,055","01:49:18,392",And I told you I was going to kill you in front of her?
tt0317919,"01:49:18,517","01:49:20,936","Well, I'm going to kill her in front of you."
tt0317919,"01:51:13,590","01:51:14,716",Ethan?
tt0317919,"01:51:18,053","01:51:19,513",Are you okay?
tt0317919,"01:51:20,597","01:51:22,307","I don't understand what's going on, Ethan."
tt0317919,"01:51:22,432","01:51:25,352",- I know. I know. Just wait. - What do those men want from you?
tt0317919,"01:51:25,477","01:51:28,105",Why are we here? How did you find me?
tt0317919,"01:51:29,231","01:51:32,025","Please, Ethan. What the hell is going on?"
tt0317919,"01:51:32,192","01:51:33,485",Are you okay?
tt0317919,"01:51:33,610","01:51:37,322","Ethan, what's wrong? Okay. Oh, God."
tt0317919,"01:51:40,450","01:51:44,329",I'm going to tell you everything. You just stay with me.
tt0317919,"01:51:50,961","01:51:53,881",Ethan. What's happening? What are you looking for?
tt0317919,"01:51:54,006","01:51:56,717",- We've got to get out of here. - Not yet.
tt0317919,"01:51:58,510","01:52:00,179",- They don't have one! - What?
tt0317919,"01:52:00,304","01:52:02,723",- A defibrillator. - A defibrillator?
tt0317919,"01:52:02,848","01:52:03,932",Ethan?
tt0317919,"01:52:04,725","01:52:08,645",Ethan? Who are these people? What the hell are we doing here?
tt0317919,"01:52:11,565","01:52:12,774",Good!
tt0317919,"01:52:14,234","01:52:16,320",This is a Beretta 92F.
tt0317919,"01:52:17,154","01:52:18,947","It's a very accurate, close-range weapon."
tt0317919,"01:52:19,072","01:52:21,283",- Don't point it at me. - Sorry.
tt0317919,"01:52:23,285","01:52:24,661",It holds 15 rounds.
tt0317919,"01:52:24,787","01:52:28,123","When the mag is empty, the slide will lock back like this."
tt0317919,"01:52:28,248","01:52:30,459",How do you know so much about this?
tt0317919,"01:52:30,584","01:52:33,170","To reload, push this button."
tt0317919,"01:52:33,629","01:52:35,172",The empty mag falls out
tt0317919,"01:52:35,297","01:52:37,216","and you shove the other one in,"
tt0317919,"01:52:37,341","01:52:39,802","like the batteries in the flashlight in the kitchen,"
tt0317919,"01:52:39,927","01:52:41,845",then release the slide.
tt0317919,"01:52:45,057","01:52:47,059",- Why are you giving me a gun? - There could be others.
tt0317919,"01:52:47,184","01:52:48,936","If you have to use it, you stay low."
tt0317919,"01:52:49,061","01:52:51,772",You identify your enemy. Point and shoot.
tt0317919,"01:52:51,897","01:52:53,440",It's very simple. Point and shoot.
tt0317919,"01:52:53,565","01:52:54,942",Stand back.
tt0317919,"01:52:56,693","01:52:57,778",Good.

tt1229238,"00:12:47,814","00:12:50,628","If The Secretary wanted me out of there,"
tt1229238,"00:12:51,406","00:12:54,078",must be pretty bad out here.
tt1229238,"00:12:56,733","00:13:00,126",We were after a file. We lost it.
tt1229238,"00:13:00,208","00:13:02,915","We? Who lost it, you?"
tt1229238,"00:13:08,141","00:13:11,340",- Agent Hanaway. - Where is Hanaway?
tt1229238,"00:13:21,219","00:13:23,332",It was a little drop
tt1229238,"00:13:23,784","00:13:25,597",... classified file.
tt1229238,"00:13:25,902","00:13:28,325",It should've been a simple intercept.
tt1229238,"00:13:36,418","00:13:38,404","They knew, which train the courier was on."
tt1229238,"00:13:38,439","00:13:40,281",ETA 2 minutes on the courier.
tt1229238,"00:13:40,316","00:13:43,267",- But there is one thing we didn't know. - Wild Cat.

tt1229238,"00:14:05,028","00:14:08,261","- Go ahead, shoot. - We're out of time."
tt1229238,"00:14:14,394","00:14:18,063","I need a name, folks. You can't track all these people at once."
tt1229238,"00:14:18,983","00:14:22,424","Aargh, Marek..Stefanski. For the love of God.."
tt1229238,"00:14:22,771","00:14:25,457",- You got it? - Marek Stefanski.
tt1229238,"00:14:28,442","00:14:30,594",Searching...
tt1229238,"00:14:42,601","00:14:44,763",I'll take it from here.
tt1229238,"00:14:54,912","00:14:55,945","Are you allright, buddy?"
tt1229238,"00:14:55,980","00:14:58,136","Hanaway dropped Marek, and grab his bag."
tt1229238,"00:14:58,137","00:15:01,884",Sit down. Get your breath.
tt1229238,"00:15:02,235","00:15:06,008",He had the file in his in hands. Easy in easy out.
tt1229238,"00:15:06,043","00:15:08,446",file's secured.
tt1229238,"00:15:08,744","00:15:11,544",But we weren't the only ones after it.
tt1229238,"00:15:11,765","00:15:14,647","Bob Cap, someone else is scratched this party."
tt1229238,"00:15:16,479","00:15:18,923",I'm not alone.
tt1229238,"00:15:18,958","00:15:22,701",- Local police? - No. Armed hostils.
tt1229238,"00:15:29,418","00:15:32,765","Maintain, I'm coming. I will get him backing up."
tt1229238,"00:15:32,957","00:15:36,423","Negative, Operator. Broad the route southwest corner, 60 seconds."
tt1229238,"00:15:38,604","00:15:41,431",Hanaway's lens came to a facial matched... and triggered a warning.
tt1229238,"00:15:39,680","00:15:41,431",...
tt1229238,"00:15:45,096","00:15:47,537",But it was too late.
tt1229238,"00:15:53,447","00:15:55,201",No!
tt1229238,"00:15:59,708","00:16:01,794",You're gonna be okay.
tt1229238,"00:16:04,770","00:16:07,425",You're so beautiful.
tt1229238,"00:16:08,099","00:16:11,830",I should've told you..
tt1229238,"00:16:15,987","00:16:18,224",It was my op.
tt1229238,"00:16:19,156","00:16:21,647",I put him in the field.
tt1229238,"00:16:22,030","00:16:25,754",And she left him just alive enough for me to see him die.
tt1229238,"00:16:42,563","00:16:45,096",I'm sorry.
tt1229238,"00:16:47,136","00:16:51,205",- You know her? - Sabine Moreau. Contract killer.
tt1229238,"00:16:52,164","00:16:54,536",Works for diamonds.
tt1229238,"00:16:55,196","00:16:57,286",Who is in the file?
tt1229238,"00:17:04,780","00:17:07,842",Russian nuclear launch codes.
tt1229238,"00:17:14,489","00:17:18,263","IMF's been looking for emerging extremist, codenamed Cobalt ."
tt1229238,"00:17:18,298","00:17:21,496",He's determined to detonate a nuclear weapon however he can.
tt1229238,"00:17:21,531","00:17:23,666",We know Moreau works for him before.
tt1229238,"00:17:23,882","00:17:26,700",What else did IMF know about him?
tt1229238,"00:17:27,115","00:17:28,709",As much as you do now.
tt1229238,"00:17:28,799","00:17:30,587","But if Moreau has nuclear launch codes,"
tt1229238,"00:17:30,588","00:17:35,661",you can bet Cobalt's confirmed person of interest to enemy number one .
tt1229238,"00:17:35,697","00:17:38,116",We're here.
tt1229238,"00:18:00,348","00:18:04,013",- Agent confirmed. - Why was he in prison?
tt1229238,"00:18:04,942","00:18:08,776",He disobeyed. After he and his wife ... you know.
tt1229238,"00:18:09,683","00:18:13,062",I thought he just been transferred. Or on leave.
tt1229238,"00:18:13,842","00:18:16,064",There were rumours then...
tt1229238,"00:18:16,099","00:18:17,841",to work on the unsanctioned hit.
tt1229238,"00:18:17,876","00:18:19,549","Welcome back, Mr. Hunt."
tt1229238,"00:18:19,584","00:18:22,847","In your absence, IMF has learnt that Cobalt is, or was,"
tt1229238,"00:18:22,882","00:18:26,111",a level one nuclear strategist for Russian Intelligent.
tt1229238,"00:18:26,112","00:18:29,170","Therefore, the only way to uncover his actual identity"
tt1229238,"00:18:29,205","00:18:32,031",is to infiltrate the Kremlin itself.
tt1229238,"00:18:32,176","00:18:33,616","In order to get passed their checkpoints,"
tt1229238,"00:18:33,651","00:18:36,681",you'll be impersonating General Anatoly Fedorov.
tt1229238,"00:18:36,682","00:18:40,560",We believe Cobalt will do everything he can to destroy any record of his identity.
tt1229238,"00:18:40,845","00:18:43,172","Your mission, should you choose to accept it,"
tt1229238,"00:18:43,207","00:18:46,355",is to penetrate the highly secured archive inside the Kremlin.
tt1229238,"00:18:46,390","00:18:48,927","And retrieve Cobalt's file, before he can destroy it."
tt1229238,"00:18:49,272","00:18:52,105","New intel suggests Cobalt is already in route,"
tt1229238,"00:18:52,210","00:18:55,437",leaving you... 4 hours 52 minutes
tt1229238,"00:18:55,692","00:18:56,971",to infiltrate.
tt1229238,"00:18:57,006","00:18:59,696","To save time, we've chosen your team for you."
tt1229238,"00:18:59,881","00:19:02,729",Agent Carter and Dunn.
tt1229238,"00:19:03,993","00:19:08,663","As always, should you or any member of your team, be caught or killed."
tt1229238,"00:19:08,698","00:19:11,448",The Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions.
tt1229238,"00:19:11,483","00:19:15,452","This message will self-destruct in 5 seconds. Good luck, Ethan."
tt1229238,"00:19:39,047","00:19:40,864",What do you got?
tt1229238,"00:19:45,029","00:19:47,799",We're going into the Kremlin.
tt1229238,"00:19:49,458","00:19:52,326","I thought you said ""the Kremlin""."
tt1229238,"00:19:52,902","00:19:56,029","I thought you said ""the Kremlin""."
tt1229238,"00:19:57,660","00:19:59,711",Okay.
tt1229238,"00:20:36,011","00:20:38,183",This is very exciting.
tt1229238,"00:20:39,581","00:20:42,789","Being on the field ... with you, you know."
tt1229238,"00:20:43,439","00:20:46,027",It's a bit of a dream ... for me.
tt1229238,"00:20:47,605","00:20:50,696",I love your disguise by the way. You look just like him.
tt1229238,"00:20:52,014","00:20:55,792",It's a shame would wear a masks. You know like a full masks.
tt1229238,"00:20:56,637","00:20:59,323","Everybody get to wear a mask, but Benji."
tt1229238,"00:21:00,344","00:21:03,269",Sorry. I'm dead. I babbled when I am nervous.
tt1229238,"00:21:03,304","00:21:05,822","When doing it again, shut up it."
tt1229238,"00:21:19,254","00:21:22,005","Okay, settle secure to go, that's x-ray machines, cameras..."
tt1229238,"00:21:22,040","00:21:24,756",metal detectors. Just what we expected.
tt1229238,"00:21:24,868","00:21:26,532",We can do this.
tt1229238,"00:21:30,468","00:21:34,185","Releasing in three, two, one."
tt1229238,"00:21:40,925","00:21:43,310","Going fast, going fast, Kremlin going fast."
tt1229238,"00:21:47,330","00:21:49,947",Mr. General.
tt1229238,"00:21:49,977","00:21:53,742","I am Major Yegorov. Show me the documents, please."
tt1229238,"00:21:59,960","00:22:04,194",Don't you think I am?
tt1229238,"00:22:28,068","00:22:31,480",It's not found.
tt1229238,"00:22:35,146","00:22:41,035","Try it again, Major ... ... Yegorov."
tt1229238,"00:22:49,657","00:22:53,330","Excuse me, General. I did not recognize."
tt1229238,"00:22:53,833","00:22:55,963","You should be kicked out, Major Yegorov."
tt1229238,"00:23:05,356","00:23:06,955",I think might not going well.
tt1229238,"00:23:07,402","00:23:10,094",- Relax. - Sorry.

tt1229238,"00:47:42,229","00:47:46,396",... some natural catastrophy devastates all life on earth.
tt1229238,"00:47:46,669","00:47:48,601",But life goes on.
tt1229238,"00:47:48,877","00:47:52,260",And what little remain is made stronger.
tt1229238,"00:47:52,594","00:47:56,168","Put simply world destruction, isn't unpleasant.."
tt1229238,"00:47:56,203","00:47:59,268",..but necessary part of evolution.
tt1229238,"00:48:01,597","00:48:03,572","What happens then, I wondered."
tt1229238,"00:48:03,712","00:48:06,578",When mankind faces the next end of the world.
tt1229238,"00:48:06,613","00:48:09,299","I don't care what you have to do, to get him to Dubai."
tt1229238,"00:48:09,334","00:48:11,986",I'll make you worse as well. Just do it.
tt1229238,"00:48:12,079","00:48:15,837","- I look to Hiroshima, Nagasaki. - Well, I'll be waiting for your call."
tt1229238,"00:48:15,872","00:48:18,626","Thriving cities, rebuilt from the ashes."

tt1229238,"00:48:23,643","00:48:26,544","It's occured to me here, that nuclear war.."
tt1229238,"00:48:26,579","00:48:29,315",might have a place in the natural order.
tt1229238,"00:48:29,688","00:48:32,158",But only if it could be controlled.
tt1229238,"00:48:32,244","00:48:36,681",Only if attached every living song equally.
tt1229238,"00:48:37,994","00:48:42,402","IMF and I believe this man, Kurt Hendricks, is a nuclear extremist."
tt1229238,"00:48:42,437","00:48:44,279","Codename, Cobalt."
tt1229238,"00:48:44,314","00:48:46,737","Today he was seen leaving the Kremlin, that would most likely"
tt1229238,"00:48:46,738","00:48:47,738",a nuclear launch device.
tt1229238,"00:48:51,159","00:48:54,106","A few days ago, Sabine Moreau killed one of our agents in Budapest."
tt1229238,"00:48:54,141","00:48:56,745",We believe him off Russian nuclear launch code.
tt1229238,"00:48:56,935","00:49:01,341",Intel indicates she would check in the Burj Hotel in Dubai in 36 hours.
tt1229238,"00:49:02,574","00:49:05,087",Mariusz Wistrom is known operative of Cobalt.
tt1229238,"00:49:05,404","00:49:07,690",Wistrom is currently on route to Dubai.
tt1229238,"00:49:07,725","00:49:11,384","For the launch device to work, Cobalt needs the activation codes."
tt1229238,"00:49:11,419","00:49:14,627","He's sending Wistrom, to buy them from Moreau."
tt1229238,"00:49:15,416","00:49:19,395",The Secretary is dead.
tt1229238,"00:49:24,707","00:49:27,627",The President has invoked Ghost Protocol.
tt1229238,"00:49:28,329","00:49:30,006",We're shut down.
tt1229238,"00:49:30,041","00:49:33,942","No satellites, safehouse, support or extraction."
tt1229238,"00:49:33,943","00:49:35,460",The four of us ...
tt1229238,"00:49:35,712","00:49:40,295",... and the content of this car are all that remain of the IMF.
tt1229238,"00:49:40,330","00:49:42,303",And as if this moment any actions are unsanctioned.
tt1229238,"00:49:42,338","00:49:46,225","So if you want out, speak now."
tt1229238,"00:50:02,390","00:50:03,919",Our mission is Hendricks.
tt1229238,"00:50:03,954","00:50:07,335","We're all  distance between him and his goal, nothing can be left to chance."
tt1229238,"00:50:07,370","00:50:10,716",Everyone connected with this man is considered an asset
tt1229238,"00:50:10,751","00:50:12,447",with valuable information about our target.
tt1229238,"00:50:12,482","00:50:14,108",No one can know we're still online.
tt1229238,"00:50:14,143","00:50:16,664","We lose Hendricks now, we lose him forever."
tt1229238,"00:50:16,699","00:50:18,188","So, what's the plan?"
tt1229238,"00:50:18,223","00:50:20,816",Wistrom  will take delivery from Moreau in 36 hours.
tt1229238,"00:50:20,851","00:50:23,136",Now we can not let the launch codes leave the hotel.
tt1229238,"00:50:23,171","00:50:26,255",But we need Wistrom to lead us to Hendricks.
tt1229238,"00:50:26,290","00:50:28,590","Yeah, we only do that if he has the codes"
tt1229238,"00:50:28,625","00:50:30,891",- Or if he thinks he has it. - Objective. ..
tt1229238,"00:50:30,926","00:50:32,575",... is to intercept the sale.
tt1229238,"00:50:32,704","00:50:34,453",Place the authentic codes with counterfeits.
tt1229238,"00:50:34,488","00:50:37,704","- and follow Wistrom to Hendricks. - Well, that's, that's simple enough."
tt1229238,"00:50:37,739","00:50:39,941","We just, we snatch the codes, we generate some fakes."
tt1229238,"00:50:40,055","00:50:43,391","Jane, you double Moreau and sell the codes to Wistrom."
tt1229238,"00:50:43,426","00:50:44,600",And bob your ankle.
tt1229238,"00:50:44,635","00:50:48,450","And how do you propose, that we just snatch the code from Moreau?"
tt1229238,"00:50:48,554","00:50:50,473",You take her out.
tt1229238,"00:50:51,641","00:50:54,674","Yeah, we take her out,but you know, discreetly."
tt1229238,"00:50:54,883","00:50:57,182",- Discreetly? - Yeah.
tt1229238,"00:50:58,346","00:51:00,224","- Right, she's an asset. - Right."
tt1229238,"00:51:00,259","00:51:02,068","I get it. Sorry. Nothing left to chance, he said."
tt1229238,"00:51:02,103","00:51:04,481","I'm just, I'm a spit bowling. You know, it's not all gonna be go."
tt1229238,"00:51:04,482","00:51:07,893",- We don't touch Wistrom.. . - All right. -..or Moreau.
tt1229238,"00:51:09,726","00:51:12,723","As you asked for Hanaway, but it has to be when I say."
tt1229238,"00:51:12,758","00:51:15,365",After we had Hendricks.
tt1229238,"00:51:20,307","00:51:22,258",- Only pack what we need. - Yeah absolutely.
tt1229238,"00:51:22,293","00:51:24,210",Only pack what we need. You never know.
tt1229238,"00:51:34,130","00:51:38,222",DUBAI
tt1229238,"00:51:52,035","00:51:55,152","So even if we can double Wistrom and Moreau,"
tt1229238,"00:51:55,187","00:51:57,649","How do we keep them in separate rooms,"
tt1229238,"00:51:57,684","00:52:00,112",Or having they think they are in the same room?
tt1229238,"00:52:00,378","00:52:02,372",We give the hotel a facelift.
tt1229238,"00:52:02,407","00:52:05,077",Wistrom will think he's arriving at Moreau's suite.
tt1229238,"00:52:05,428","00:52:07,782","But really, he will be walking into our decoy room."
tt1229238,"00:52:07,817","00:52:09,391",Where I'll double Moreau.
tt1229238,"00:52:09,426","00:52:11,393",Downstairs Benji will double Wistrom...
tt1229238,"00:52:11,428","00:52:13,883",- a masks! - And meet with real Moreau.
tt1229238,"00:52:13,959","00:52:17,476","And eh, huh, What am I doing?"
tt1229238,"00:52:18,010","00:52:20,745",You? You're the helper.
tt1229238,"00:52:23,468","00:52:25,989",Help ... okay.
tt1229238,"00:52:26,104","00:52:29,498","So, to the extent understand what are you talking about here  ..."
tt1229238,"00:52:30,622","00:52:33,065","uhm, Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world."
tt1229238,"00:52:33,348","00:52:35,488","And you want to alter its infrastructure,"
tt1229238,"00:52:35,523","00:52:37,556",with the hopes of convincing two people that
tt1229238,"00:52:38,362","00:52:41,591","they had a meeting, which actually really never happened ..."
tt1229238,"00:52:42,644","00:52:44,685",Right?
tt1229238,"00:52:52,072","00:52:54,226",Camels.
tt1229238,"00:53:40,397","00:53:42,710",ETA on dry cleaning.
tt1229238,"00:53:42,968","00:53:45,061",I'm on my way out.
tt1229238,"00:53:47,630","00:53:49,928","Okay, 34 minutes to doorknock."
tt1229238,"00:53:56,501","00:54:00,732","wow,.. ehm, okay. this, this is a slight wrinkle,.. nothing, nothing to worry about."
tt1229238,"00:54:00,767","00:54:04,478","We're just gonna have to go into server room, from the outside."
tt1229238,"00:54:05,797","00:54:10,473","- What? - Well, the firewalls in this building serve a  military grade."
tt1229238,"00:54:10,508","00:54:13,467","I mean, this would be a synched if I could call Yusuf back at headquarter,"
tt1229238,"00:54:13,502","00:54:15,882","but Yusuf doen't exist anymore, and neither do we."
tt1229238,"00:54:15,917","00:54:17,488","I could hack it, but it would take too long."
tt1229238,"00:54:17,523","00:54:18,636",Their hardware in.
tt1229238,"00:54:18,637","00:54:21,383",And there's four layers of an exchange security because not in server-in.
tt1229238,"00:54:21,418","00:54:23,871",and there is no way we can get into it from inside.
tt1229238,"00:54:24,193","00:54:28,770","If we can't get through the server, we don't control the elevators, we don't control security cameras."
tt1229238,"00:54:28,961","00:54:30,977",This operation is over even before it begins.
tt1229238,"00:54:31,012","00:54:32,994",I'm telling you we can get to it from outside.
tt1229238,"00:54:33,029","00:54:34,865",We?
tt1229238,"00:54:35,051","00:54:37,589","I'm,  I'm on the computer."
tt1229238,"00:54:38,497","00:54:42,328",I'm just a ... the helper.
tt1229238,"00:54:45,364","00:54:48,218",- What floor is it now? - 130.
tt1229238,"00:54:48,783","00:54:51,525",130 ?
tt1229238,"00:54:54,343","00:54:55,632",- Vent out? - pressure's unstiff.
tt1229238,"00:54:55,633","00:54:56,633",don't have enough time.
tt1229238,"00:54:56,790","00:54:58,008",- Elevator shaft. - infrared sensors.
tt1229238,"00:54:58,009","00:54:59,009",don't have enough time.
tt1229238,"00:55:02,924","00:55:05,610",How am I suppose to do this?
tt1229238,"00:55:11,017","00:55:12,967",Dammit!
tt1229238,"00:55:15,606","00:55:17,907","Oh, that's high."
tt1229238,"00:55:22,686","00:55:26,607","Okay, now remember, it's a rolling off motion, that disengages the bond."
tt1229238,"00:55:26,880","00:55:28,840","When the emitter is blue, that's full adhesion."
tt1229238,"00:55:28,940","00:55:30,880","Easy way to remember. ""Blue is glue."""
tt1229238,"00:55:30,915","00:55:32,821",- And when it's red? - Dead.
tt1229238,"00:55:32,921","00:55:35,555","ah, here's your cutter, okay? And your server interface."
tt1229238,"00:55:35,590","00:55:36,711",Both going back here.
tt1229238,"00:55:36,746","00:55:38,391","One, two."
tt1229238,"00:55:38,426","00:55:41,091","Okay Ethan, holds-all service, 11 stories up"
tt1229238,"00:55:41,092","00:55:42,327",and 7 units over.
tt1229238,"00:55:42,841","00:55:43,762",Okay?
tt1229238,"00:55:44,075","00:55:47,011","- Com check? - Yeah, copy."
tt1229238,"00:55:48,859","00:55:50,616",So ...
tt1229238,"00:55:54,240","00:55:57,007",It's 26 minutes to doorknock.
tt1229238,"00:56:12,700","00:56:13,700",Yeah ...
tt1229238,"00:56:53,771","00:56:56,082",25 minutes to doorknock.
tt1229238,"00:57:11,062","00:57:13,055",What the hell is that?
tt1229238,"00:57:27,498","00:57:30,263","Hell, what the hell is that?"
tt1229238,"00:57:31,456","00:57:33,805",It's a sandstorm.
tt1229238,"00:57:35,331","00:57:37,925","It's a long way off, Ethan. There's shouldn't be a problem."
tt1229238,"00:57:40,847","00:57:43,335",24 minutes to doorknock.
tt1229238,"00:57:46,481","00:57:48,450",Where is Ethan?
tt1229238,"00:57:50,459","00:57:52,748",You gotta be kidding me.
tt1229238,"00:58:41,696","00:58:44,534",23 minutes to doorknock.
tt1229238,"00:59:03,051","00:59:05,169",I'm in the server level.
tt1229238,"00:59:27,505","00:59:30,093",23 minutes to doorknock.
tt1229238,"00:59:30,266","00:59:33,163",Your countdown is not helping.
tt1229238,"00:59:34,770","00:59:36,676",I'm just saying.
tt1229238,"01:00:06,138","01:00:08,918","- I'm in. - That's great, Ethan. You're half way home."
tt1229238,"01:00:16,491","01:00:18,655",Located server.
tt1229238,"01:00:24,626","01:00:26,361",Please tell me we're online.
tt1229238,"01:00:26,468","01:00:28,415","All right, we're live."
tt1229238,"01:00:28,450","01:00:30,362","Okay, now I have control of the elevators."
tt1229238,"01:00:30,462","01:00:33,056",- And the security cameras. - Time to evacuate.
tt1229238,"01:00:33,091","01:00:35,918","Okay. You drive, and look out for Wistrom and Moreau."
tt1229238,"01:00:50,981","01:00:54,063",Moreau is at the elevator. It has resceduled.
tt1229238,"01:00:54,266","01:00:55,749",Go.
tt1229238,"01:01:00,972","01:01:04,201","- We can't open this door, can  we? - That door? No."
tt1229238,"01:01:04,236","01:01:06,743",Ethan you gotta get down here now.
tt1229238,"01:01:07,262","01:01:10,346",Ethan. Ethan. Is there a problem?
tt1229238,"01:01:11,061","01:01:12,667",Ethan?
tt1229238,"01:01:18,952","01:01:21,650",- We're not gonna make it. - We have to make it.
tt1229238,"01:01:22,529","01:01:24,320",Where is Ethan?
tt1229238,"01:01:45,040","01:01:49,534","- Your line is not long enough! - No, shit!"
tt1229238,"01:02:36,430","01:02:39,812","That was not easy, but I, I did it."
tt1229238,"01:02:42,820","01:02:44,689",What I missed?
tt1229238,"01:02:50,556","01:02:54,066",The lense might be a little uncomfortable.
tt1229238,"01:02:54,101","01:02:57,609",It captures images and transmits them to the printer in the briefcase.
tt1229238,"01:02:58,007","01:02:59,887",- All right? - hmm...
tt1229238,"01:03:00,085","01:03:02,273","I can't see, one eye right of it, fine."
tt1229238,"01:03:02,308","01:03:04,461",Blinks twice to activate the shutter.
tt1229238,"01:03:05,410","01:03:08,357","Notice, the numbers are in order."
tt1229238,"01:03:11,068","01:03:13,504",A perfect copy.
tt1229238,"01:03:13,937","01:03:16,501",But the numbers are scrambled.
tt1229238,"01:03:17,294","01:03:20,489","Masks? ah, 60 seconds. Are you sure that I shouldn't wear a mask?"
tt1229238,"01:03:20,524","01:03:22,767","You know, cause I'm not exactly Omar Sharif."
tt1229238,"01:03:22,767","01:03:25,135",I'll play a french. This is you tracking device.

tt1229238,"01:03:26,990","01:03:28,697","No, it's a paper. It's in the briefcase."
tt1229238,"01:03:28,697","01:03:30,781","It's caught to be isotops, which should give a unique  ..."
tt1229238,"01:03:30,781","01:03:33,157","- It just means that you can track documents, even if they switch briefcases. - Range?"
tt1229238,"01:03:33,157","01:03:35,596","- Not that good, like a half a mile (800 meters)."
tt1229238,"01:03:35,596","01:03:37,884",Safest thing to do not let Wistrom out of your sight.
tt1229238,"01:03:37,885","01:03:39,534",Is that Wistrom?
tt1229238,"01:03:43,981","01:03:44,980",Who's out with him?
tt1229238,"01:03:44,980","01:03:47,391","- I don't know. - We don't have an uplink, so there's no facial recognition."
tt1229238,"01:03:47,391","01:03:49,843",Who's out with him?
tt1229238,"01:03:50,228","01:03:52,838",That's Leonid Lisenker. Polish phone cryptographer.
tt1229238,"01:03:52,838","01:03:56,097",He redesigned Russia's nuclear security at the Cold War.
tt1229238,"01:03:56,098","01:03:58,376",He set off to authenticate the launch codes.
tt1229238,"01:03:58,376","01:04:00,105","- yeah shit, we are blown. - No, no, no."
tt1229238,"01:04:00,105","01:04:02,941","Well, we'll would be as soon as he sees the counterfeit launch codes."
tt1229238,"01:04:02,941","01:04:05,290",- We're not alone. - He's in the elevator.
tt1229238,"01:04:05,290","01:04:07,467",Delay it.
tt1229238,"01:04:15,767","01:04:17,975","Benji, how long would take it reprogram the case?"
tt1229238,"01:04:17,975","01:04:19,950","Ah, a couple seconds. Wow, What for that?"
tt1229238,"01:04:19,950","01:04:22,969",- To make an exact copy of the launch codes. - What?!
tt1229238,"01:04:22,969","01:04:25,060",- You can't do that. - Wistrom's on 22.
tt1229238,"01:04:25,060","01:04:27,427",- Slow him down. - I do what I can.
tt1229238,"01:04:29,365","01:04:32,534","wait, wait, Ethan! Hey! Hang on now, hang on, just a second!"
tt1229238,"01:04:32,534","01:04:36,033","You, you're talking about handing over active nuclear launch code to Wistrom?"
tt1229238,"01:04:36,033","01:04:38,772","- the case, reprogram the case. - Listen, listen, stop! Listen, listen."
tt1229238,"01:04:38,966","01:04:41,512","You're saying you're fixating, you're thinking clearly."
tt1229238,"01:04:41,512","01:04:43,333","Listen, that's not gonna happened!"
tt1229238,"01:04:43,560","01:04:45,691","- I won't allow it. - 33, and climbing."
tt1229238,"01:04:45,691","01:04:49,066","Brandt, use your head. The mission is not the code, the mission is Hendricks."
tt1229238,"01:04:49,066","01:04:51,273","And this little play out, give him back codes neutralize it."
tt1229238,"01:04:51,273","01:04:53,269",You know that won't do it. Failure to a terrorist...
tt1229238,"01:04:53,269","01:04:55,260",...just a rehearsal for success.
tt1229238,"01:04:55,260","01:04:56,529",41!
tt1229238,"01:04:56,529","01:04:58,928","We lose Hendricks today, he shows up somewhere else tomorrow."
tt1229238,"01:04:58,928","01:05:01,632",He finds another way. With no IMF to stop him.
tt1229238,"01:05:01,632","01:05:03,950","Now, it's now or never. Now hand me the case."
tt1229238,"01:05:03,950","01:05:06,115",Nothing left to chance. You said that !
tt1229238,"01:05:06,115","01:05:07,800",You're the analyst. Now tell me..
tt1229238,"01:05:07,801","01:05:09,419",..there's another way for Hendricks to get those codes. - 50!
tt1229238,"01:05:10,425","01:05:13,226","You tell me that this is only happened right here, right now. Today!"
tt1229238,"01:05:13,226","01:05:15,073","You tell me that, I'll walk away."
tt1229238,"01:05:23,197","01:05:24,953",- We go without! - Without masks?
tt1229238,"01:05:24,954","01:05:26,500",- Changes to go. - Ethan!
tt1229238,"01:05:26,501","01:05:29,263","- We have no choice. - Ethan, you will be walking on Moreau unarmed."
tt1229238,"01:05:29,263","01:05:31,986",- Face first. Literally. - How do we know they've met?
tt1229238,"01:05:31,987","01:05:33,862",- How do we know they haven't? - It doesn't matter!
tt1229238,"01:05:34,960","01:05:37,848",Damn! We have no choice.
tt1229238,"01:06:29,374","01:06:30,822",Goggles.
tt1229238,"01:06:33,003","01:06:35,096",What if they have met?
tt1229238,"01:06:36,991","01:06:39,143",Come in.

tt1229238,"01:08:52,966","01:08:55,969",You want payment? I want guarantees.

tt1229238,"01:13:34,636","01:13:36,504",I'll handle it.
tt1229238,"01:13:49,169","01:13:53,023","Benji, I got a lot call of Wistrom, but I can't tell. Is he still in the elevator?"

tt1229238,"01:14:57,066","01:14:58,996",You and I are not enemies. It was a setup.
tt1229238,"01:14:58,996","01:15:03,029",We'll find out your lies soon enough. Move it!
tt1229238,"01:15:04,716","01:15:07,425",I'm sorry about this.

tt1229238,"01:16:15,666","01:16:17,815","Jane, don't!"
tt1229238,"01:22:13,675","01:22:15,218","Now what happened with Moreau, Jane?"
tt1229238,"01:22:15,218","01:22:18,014","- She couldn't help us with... - Yeah, so let's throw her off the building?"
tt1229238,"01:22:18,114","01:22:20,161",- I didn't throw her! - That's throw her off the building!
tt1229238,"01:22:20,161","01:22:22,687","She was not the mission, Jane."
tt1229238,"01:22:22,687","01:22:26,313",The mission was to track the file back to Hendricks.
tt1229238,"01:22:26,680","01:22:29,586",Whose in the wind ...
tt1229238,"01:22:50,686","01:22:53,866",Better have good news for me. Is he here?
tt1229238,"01:22:55,694","01:22:58,816",I got it. Talk to you later. I'll be there.
tt1229238,"01:22:58,816","01:23:02,094",But no one will be following me. Just make sure no one's following you.
tt1229238,"01:23:02,194","01:23:04,852",- And how the hell that the Russians find us? - Why do you ask me for?
tt1229238,"01:23:05,009","01:23:07,610",Because you are in communication. You in charge covering our tracks.
tt1229238,"01:23:07,611","01:23:10,647","We can not afford to make mistakes like that now, Benji."
tt1229238,"01:23:10,647","01:23:13,038",You are  not a technician anymore. You're field agent.
tt1229238,"01:23:13,038","01:23:15,127",And you're just an analyst?!
tt1229238,"01:23:16,014","01:23:18,526",Right? Right?
tt1229238,"01:23:20,144","01:23:23,127","Who are you really, Brandt?"
tt1229238,"01:23:23,649","01:23:25,520",- What do you ask me? - What am I asking?
tt1229238,"01:23:25,520","01:23:27,413",Let me see if I can put in another ...
tt1229238,"01:23:34,857","01:23:39,179","How does an agent whose skills like that, end up an analyst?"
tt1229238,"01:23:46,896","01:23:49,541",What if we all have secrets?
tt1229238,"01:23:50,539","01:23:53,223","tell me, Ethan."
tt1229238,"01:23:57,018","01:23:59,983","You tell me yours, I tell you mine."
tt1229238,"01:24:12,374","01:24:14,519",I'm all clear.
tt1229238,"01:24:19,350","01:24:22,980",I have friends in the region. Just sit tight. I'll send someone to get you out of here.
tt1229238,"01:24:23,192","01:24:25,155",What about Hendricks? What's the plan?
tt1229238,"01:24:25,156","01:24:28,077",The plan was first to stop him together.
tt1229238,"01:24:28,116","01:24:31,402",- And what would you gonna do? - Change the plan.
tt1229238,"01:24:31,402","01:24:33,510","Wait, that's it?"
tt1229238,"01:24:33,659","01:24:35,996",What we gonna do? go after him alone?
tt1229238,"01:24:37,907","01:24:40,540","You can explain yourself, agent Brandt?"
tt1229238,"01:25:44,687","01:25:47,513",I was in a protection detail in Croatia.
tt1229238,"01:25:47,816","01:25:51,101","Shadowing the assets, husband and wife."
tt1229238,"01:25:52,151","01:25:56,035",We were never suppose to know we were there. Whole things routines as in no crap.
tt1229238,"01:25:59,275","01:26:05,521","Three years in,we caught wind that this Serbian hit squad was after our couple."
tt1229238,"01:26:05,757","01:26:09,654","But my team had it under control, I knew that they would coming."
tt1229238,"01:26:10,980","01:26:15,315",But I couldn't shake this feeling that I should warn the couple somehow.
tt1229238,"01:26:15,315","01:26:18,383",I wanted to..  find the way to let them know
tt1229238,"01:26:20,007","01:26:23,133","But you know, orders are oders, so I didn't."
tt1229238,"01:26:27,836","01:26:32,210","One day, the husband decides to leave the hotel and go for a run."
tt1229238,"01:26:32,210","01:26:33,798",So I followed him.
tt1229238,"01:26:34,374","01:26:37,113",And leave two men with the wife.
tt1229238,"01:26:37,921","01:26:40,058","When I get back,"
tt1229238,"01:26:40,058","01:26:42,951",my guys were unconscious and the wife is gone.
tt1229238,"01:26:43,875","01:26:46,765",Local police found her body three days later.
tt1229238,"01:26:47,881","01:26:50,553",What was left over anyway.
tt1229238,"01:26:55,502","01:26:58,215",It was my last day on the field.
tt1229238,"01:26:59,112","01:27:02,461",I couldn't face another life or death situations after that.
tt1229238,"01:27:02,461","01:27:04,281","So, what happened with her husband?"
tt1229238,"01:27:04,495","01:27:07,240",Never saw him again.
tt1229238,"01:27:07,819","01:27:12,653","Until two days ago, in Moscow, when the Secretary introduced me to Ethan Hunt."
tt1229238,"01:27:16,285","01:27:19,628","No, that's not what happened. She left him, you know."
tt1229238,"01:27:19,622","01:27:22,597","I heard that one too, Benji."
tt1229238,"01:27:22,853","01:27:26,481","But, unfortunately, I was there."
tt1229238,"01:27:27,227","01:27:30,953",Just like I was there when the Secretary got the phone call..
tt1229238,"01:27:30,954","01:27:35,491",..that Ethan was in custody for killing 6 Serbian nationals  in cold blood.
tt1229238,"01:27:35,609","01:27:37,690","- ah, I'm sorry, shouldn't hit? - Yeah."
tt1229238,"01:27:37,734","01:27:40,769",Disavowed.
tt1229238,"01:27:48,153","01:27:52,629",Last thing I know ... I am on the plane to Dubai.
tt1229238,"01:27:53,977","01:27:57,776",Wondering the old time ... Do I tell him?
tt1229238,"01:27:59,766","01:28:02,512",How do I tell him?
tt1229238,"01:28:03,457","01:28:06,185",That I'm responsible.
tt1229238,"01:28:07,926","01:28:11,093",I could've warned him. I should've warned him.
tt1229238,"01:28:13,652","01:28:15,915",But I didn't.
tt1229238,"01:28:16,956","01:28:19,210",And she died.
tt1229238,"01:28:24,846","01:28:28,435","Sergei! Sergei, my friend!"
tt1229238,"01:28:28,435","01:28:31,498","I told you, I was gathered here. Didn't I say?"
tt1229238,"01:28:31,498","01:28:33,669","- I don't know it's him? - Yes, it's him."
tt1229238,"01:28:33,791","01:28:36,004","You trust me, I trust you, right?"
tt1229238,"01:28:36,728","01:28:41,024","This is the guy! This is the guy, the one I told you about."
tt1229238,"01:28:41,120","01:28:43,988","So, we can take these things off."
tt1229238,"01:28:48,455","01:28:51,637","Sorry, he's a great guy, but he doesn't know you like I do, you understand."
tt1229238,"01:28:51,637","01:28:54,611","So, you work for American government?"
tt1229238,"01:28:55,835","01:28:59,737","- And you are an arm stealer. - No, no! Sergei, Sergei!"
tt1229238,"01:29:00,423","01:29:04,517","He's independent defense coordinator, right?"
tt1229238,"01:29:05,589","01:29:07,591","That's right, very classic job."
tt1229238,"01:29:07,591","01:29:10,337","- Listen, he's a friend. - Those diamonds are for Bogdan."
tt1229238,"01:29:10,338","01:29:12,278","No, no, it's okay. He can have it."
tt1229238,"01:29:12,593","01:29:16,049","Whatever arrangements you made with my cousin, it's between you and him."
tt1229238,"01:29:16,140","01:29:18,795","You want something from me, you pay."
tt1229238,"01:29:18,795","01:29:21,700",You misunderstand. I am not buying.
tt1229238,"01:29:21,794","01:29:23,606",I'm selling.
tt1229238,"01:29:23,743","01:29:25,830",You selling?
tt1229238,"01:29:26,009","01:29:28,873",- Selling what? - The future.
tt1229238,"01:29:29,523","01:29:31,513","Yeah, I got all I need, thank you."
tt1229238,"01:29:31,513","01:29:34,033",Our countries are on the break of war.
tt1229238,"01:29:34,033","01:29:36,322",War is very good for business.
tt1229238,"01:29:36,322","01:29:39,022",Nuclear war?
tt1229238,"01:29:48,207","01:29:49,415",Go on.
tt1229238,"01:29:49,415","01:29:52,571",I'm looking for a man named Kurt Hendricks. You may know him as Cobalt.
tt1229238,"01:29:52,671","01:29:55,538","In this case, I think you know what he wants."
tt1229238,"01:29:55,720","01:29:58,764",I bet he even try to buy it from you at some point.
tt1229238,"01:29:59,819","01:30:03,277","- Go on. - He has a case, he has codes."
tt1229238,"01:30:03,608","01:30:06,656",But they're worthless without tactical satellite.
tt1229238,"01:30:07,186","01:30:10,080",I want to know where he get it.
tt1229238,"01:30:10,080","01:30:13,990",A man with information like that would be a potential terrorist.
tt1229238,"01:30:14,565","01:30:21,106","And to your government, a potential terrorist is a terrorist."
tt1229238,"01:30:23,499","01:30:26,019",Do you help me?
tt1229238,"01:30:26,019","01:30:30,004",My friends become your friends.
tt1229238,"01:30:32,082","01:30:35,949",Sorry. I can not help you.
tt1229238,"01:30:41,585","01:30:46,164","I certainly can not tell you that, Russia quitely sold an obselete technical satellite..."
tt1229238,"01:30:46,164","01:30:49,656",to a certain telecom in Mumbai.
tt1229238,"01:30:50,387","01:30:53,500",And who ever gave them that idea?
tt1229238,"01:30:54,109","01:30:56,559",An enterprising third party.
tt1229238,"01:30:56,559","01:30:58,040",Working on commission.
tt1229238,"01:30:58,040","01:31:01,793","Helping old friends, making new ones."
tt1229238,"01:31:01,793","01:31:05,399",- Can the satellite be shut down? - That would take a special skills then.
tt1229238,"01:31:06,319","01:31:08,642",You can not do it alone.
tt1229238,"01:31:33,915","01:31:36,727",- What's in the bags? - It's our gear.
tt1229238,"01:31:37,098","01:31:40,533",- How'd you get it? - Made a friend.
tt1229238,"01:31:41,339","01:31:44,083",- I'm glad we could help. - You can help now.
tt1229238,"01:31:44,986","01:31:47,600","- Look Ethan, before... - Whatever happened, happened."
tt1229238,"01:31:47,601","01:31:53,083","We still have a chance to clean this up. But we have to do it now, we have to do it together."
tt1229238,"01:31:59,913","01:32:02,403","Yeah sure, where are we going?"
tt1229238,"01:32:03,215","01:32:05,363",India.
tt1229238,"01:32:08,793","01:32:11,442","- India? India? - Yeah, sure. - Okay."
tt1229238,"01:32:15,176","01:32:17,180",Love the jet!
tt1229238,"01:32:17,180","01:32:19,602",Where do you see the car?
tt1229238,"01:32:25,846","01:32:28,445","- Sidorov. - (in Russian) What are you doing, man?"
tt1229238,"01:32:28,445","01:32:30,392",You were ...
tt1229238,"01:32:30,858","01:32:34,033",I was worried for nothing.
tt1229238,"01:32:38,655","01:32:42,803",- I heard that you're looking for an American.. - Continue.
tt1229238,"01:32:43,600","01:32:49,513",And launching devices were stolen yesterday.
tt1229238,"01:32:50,234","01:32:54,599",- Seriously? - I can help you find them.
tt1229238,"01:32:54,599","01:32:57,890",If you agree with that.
tt1229238,"01:33:03,620","01:33:04,740",Brij Nath.
tt1229238,"01:33:04,740","01:33:07,161",Brij Nath. Playboy. Multimedia tycoon.
tt1229238,"01:33:07,566","01:33:10,700","On the surface, this turn network as state of the art"
tt1229238,"01:33:10,814","01:33:14,150",but its  build time illegally acquired Cold War cast off
tt1229238,"01:33:14,150","01:33:16,095","including this,the Novosti satellite."
tt1229238,"01:33:16,289","01:33:18,087","Hendricks needs it to launch a nuclear strike,"
tt1229238,"01:33:18,087","01:33:21,020","and we have to shut it down, before he gets that chance."
tt1229238,"01:33:21,020","01:33:23,807","And to do that we need to get the acess codes from him,"
tt1229238,"01:33:23,807","01:33:25,838",one way or another.
tt1229238,"01:33:26,112","01:33:28,398",And if I don't ...
tt1229238,"01:33:28,624","01:33:31,381",None of this works.
tt1229238,"01:33:31,381","01:33:34,122",- You can do this. - Yeah.
tt1229238,"01:33:34,528","01:33:37,305",A week ago I would've believed you.
tt1229238,"01:33:42,538","01:33:45,412",I don't blame you for what happened.
tt1229238,"01:33:49,807","01:33:52,975",She took someone you cared about. That just not something ...
tt1229238,"01:33:54,097","01:33:55,920","...you just, let go."
tt1229238,"01:33:56,559","01:34:00,163",Did that make you feel better?
tt1229238,"01:34:01,061","01:34:04,045",When you kill the man who killed your wife?
tt1229238,"01:34:12,042","01:34:14,684",We can't get them back.
tt1229238,"01:34:20,328","01:34:24,354","Okay, to shut down the satellite we have to manually tap into the central server."
tt1229238,"01:34:24,521","01:34:28,150",And you'll enter through the exhaust vent wearing this under your suit.
tt1229238,"01:34:28,150","01:34:30,346",I'll drop down into the computer ray
tt1229238,"01:34:30,346","01:34:32,727","and I'll catch you, and we have you along the relay room"
tt1229238,"01:34:32,727","01:34:34,911",and you jack into the panel.
tt1229238,"01:34:38,119","01:34:40,805","Okay, so we enter the party separately as guests"
tt1229238,"01:34:40,805","01:34:43,537","Ethan quarterbacks, while Jane gets the codes ..."
tt1229238,"01:34:43,538","01:34:46,398","from billionaire, I switch off the vent, you jump into the computer,"
tt1229238,"01:34:46,398","01:34:48,422","and I'll catch you, you plug in the transmitter,"
tt1229238,"01:34:48,422","01:34:52,081","Ethan feeds me the codes, which I then use to pinpoit Hendricks' location."
tt1229238,"01:34:52,081","01:34:55,470","okay, you breach over something,"
tt1229238,"01:34:55,470","01:35:00,387","I think it really important to computer array, part,.. or I just,.. jump?"
tt1229238,"01:35:01,015","01:35:02,870",- And I catch you. - Yeah.
tt1229238,"01:35:02,870","01:35:05,070","I don't,.. Why is it so hard to grasp?"

tt1229238,"01:35:09,893","01:35:12,086",- and it's using magnets. - Yeah
tt1229238,"01:35:13,176","01:35:16,630","In lye of our recent efforts, the technology is. .."
tt1229238,"01:35:16,630","01:35:20,276",Science is sign. I'd be more worried about the heat.
tt1229238,"01:35:21,454","01:35:23,692",And then there is that... What heat?
tt1229238,"01:35:24,260","01:35:26,850","Well it's like any computer, isn't it? If you switch off the fan,"
tt1229238,"01:35:27,030","01:35:29,040",it's gonna get really hot.
tt1229238,"01:35:29,040","01:35:31,160","- Of course. - Relatively, you know."
tt1229238,"01:35:32,978","01:35:36,637",Of course it will. So I'm jumping into a ...

tt1229238,"01:42:59,406","01:43:03,504","Look left, look up. I find your complicious passion intriguing."
tt1229238,"01:43:04,356","01:43:10,686","You can keep repeat telling anyone, but he's not your type. completely not your type. He's completely cold, I'm hot."

tt1229238,"01:46:02,851","01:46:05,888","Hendricks is killing the server, before we can count the satellite."
tt1229238,"01:46:05,888","01:46:07,787",Hendricks is reprogramming the satellite.
tt1229238,"01:46:07,787","01:46:10,523",He's gonna lost its capabilty in five minutes.

tt1229238,"01:48:50,887","01:48:52,838",That should start the ball running.

tt1229238,"01:48:54,452","01:48:56,972",How long it till Hendricks can launch the missile?
tt1229238,"01:48:56,973","01:48:58,903",Less than 30 seconds.

tt1229238,"01:50:57,717","01:50:59,819",The missile's in the air.
tt1229238,"01:51:11,999","01:51:13,989",There has to be a way to abort the warhead.
tt1229238,"01:51:13,989","01:51:15,753",If there is a wild on the launch device.
tt1229238,"01:51:15,753","01:51:18,221",We gonna get that case!
tt1229238,"01:51:27,701","01:51:31,063",May there be peace on Earth.

tt1229238,"01:52:14,931","01:52:16,706",Wistrom destroyed the relay.
tt1229238,"01:52:16,706","01:52:19,084","- Ethan ran after Hendricks and case, but.. - It doesn't matter if he has the case."
tt1229238,"01:52:19,084","01:52:20,700",We can't transmit the abort codes.
tt1229238,"01:52:20,700","01:52:24,522","- Can you fix it? - ah yeah, but it's gonna be pointless we don't have any power."
tt1229238,"01:52:24,557","01:52:26,102",Wistrom!
tt1229238,"01:52:27,534","01:52:29,918",- Jane? - I'm okay.

tt1229238,"01:58:53,235","01:58:56,298",You wanted me to find you.
tt1229238,"01:58:58,569","01:59:01,548",How else to deal with all these?
tt1229238,"01:59:08,351","01:59:11,307",hospital?

tt1229238,"01:59:24,237","01:59:26,771",large enough to be visible during daylight.
tt1229238,"01:59:26,771","01:59:28,923",You actually said that?
tt1229238,"01:59:28,923","01:59:32,242",Outloud? Mission accomplished?
tt1229238,"01:59:32,642","01:59:35,865",- I said it. - You're still cornered Ethan.
tt1229238,"01:59:36,261","01:59:38,986",And I can't imagine the look on that guy's face.
tt1229238,"01:59:40,635","01:59:42,882",- Hey - These must be them.
tt1229238,"01:59:42,791","01:59:46,491","Luther Stickell, the affirmative,  Carter, Dunn and Brandt."

tt1229238,"02:00:10,785","02:00:12,783","on that car you crashed, Ethan."
tt1229238,"02:00:12,784","02:00:16,602",Something about intentional a hundred meters that could drop not being covered.
tt1229238,"02:00:16,611","02:00:18,334",Go figured.

tt1229238,"02:00:35,715","02:00:37,437","Caught sweats, middle of the night."
tt1229238,"02:00:38,287","02:00:41,037","All these people are just happy and smiling,"
tt1229238,"02:00:41,037","02:00:45,266","and they are completely oblivious, for the fact they were almost...vaporized."
tt1229238,"02:00:46,104","02:00:49,408",- and if I've been inferred... - Dumb luck?
tt1229238,"02:00:49,931","02:00:51,244",Was it?
tt1229238,"02:00:52,247","02:00:55,990","I mean, look, we were unprepared, in the dark,"
tt1229238,"02:00:55,990","02:00:58,062",disavowed.
tt1229238,"02:00:58,570","02:01:00,841",The only thing that functioned properly
tt1229238,"02:01:01,317","02:01:03,590","on that mission,"
tt1229238,"02:01:04,049","02:01:06,214",was this team.
tt1229238,"02:01:07,330","02:01:09,978","I don't know how we ended up together,"
tt1229238,"02:01:11,874","02:01:14,254",but I'm glad we did.
tt1229238,"02:01:20,668","02:01:22,968",Your missions.
tt1229238,"02:01:22,968","02:01:25,519",Choose to accept them.
tt1229238,"02:01:30,177","02:01:31,836","all right ... you know, I am in."
tt1229238,"02:01:32,129","02:01:35,912","Seriously, this is not as hard as any mission gonna rougher than the last one, is it?"
tt1229238,"02:01:37,654","02:01:40,628","It's just ... a bomb, is it?"
tt1229238,"02:01:58,914","02:02:01,578","- Thanks, Ethan. - I thank you."
tt1229238,"02:02:03,710","02:02:06,622",- Agent Hunt. - Agent Carter.

tt1229238,"02:02:19,202","02:02:23,767","I'm not picking up that phone Ethan, because I don't think you want me the field"
tt1229238,"02:02:26,522","02:02:29,193",I know your wife is dead.
tt1229238,"02:02:30,840","02:02:33,762",I was there in Croatia.
tt1229238,"02:02:34,656","02:02:37,367",I was there for one reason. One.
tt1229238,"02:02:38,392","02:02:40,724",And I failed.
tt1229238,"02:02:44,152","02:02:46,393",It was my job to protect her.
tt1229238,"02:02:46,393","02:02:49,326",How do you know she's dead?
tt1229238,"02:02:51,240","02:02:55,944",- where's the body? - Did you see it?
tt1229238,"02:02:57,690","02:03:00,786",- You killed those Serbians. - I had to get her back.
tt1229238,"02:03:00,786","02:03:02,632",You sent out to rankout prison.
tt1229238,"02:03:02,632","02:03:04,551",That was a sacrifice I'm willing to make.
tt1229238,"02:03:04,551","02:03:07,936",IMF suspected that Hendricks had people in rankout.
tt1229238,"02:03:10,233","02:03:13,299",And six dead Serbians was your idea of cover?
tt1229238,"02:03:14,567","02:03:17,346","I always not one, not"
tt1229238,"02:03:33,349","02:03:36,111",Secretary never told me.
tt1229238,"02:03:39,365","02:03:42,757",I accepted the direct call prison mission on one condition.
tt1229238,"02:03:42,757","02:03:45,994",No one can know she's still alive.
tt1229238,"02:03:46,518","02:03:49,568",But ... you telling me.
tt1229238,"02:03:56,925","02:03:59,945",When did you find out that I was in Croatia?
tt1229238,"02:04:00,046","02:04:04,400","- I put your file, after India. - Great."

tt1229238,"02:04:09,911","02:04:13,158","As long as we're together, she can never be safe."
tt1229238,"02:04:13,926","02:04:16,744","It wasn't your job to protect her, Brandt."
tt1229238,"02:04:19,214","02:04:21,423",It's mine.
tt1229238,"02:04:27,608","02:04:31,539",- So we're good? - We're good.
tt1229238,"02:05:52,900","02:05:54,378","Good evening, Mr. Hunt."
tt1229238,"02:05:54,378","02:05:58,324","36 hours ago, there was a breach on military's communication network."
tt1229238,"02:05:58,324","02:06:02,982","Now, an emerging terror organization known as the Syndicate,"
tt1229238,"02:06:02,982","02:06:04,358",has control over entire drone fleet.

tt1981115,"00:00:34,040","00:00:38,628","Long before the birth of light‎, there was darkness‎."
tt1981115,"00:00:38,795","00:00:42,840",And from that darkness came the Dark Elves‎.
tt1981115,"00:00:44,717","00:00:48,429","Millennia ago‎, the most ruthless of their kind‎, Malekith"
tt1981115,"00:00:48,596","00:00:53,434",sought to transform our universe back into one of eternal night‎.
tt1981115,"00:00:55,895","00:01:00,608","Such evil was possible through the power of the Aether‎,"
tt1981115,"00:01:00,817","00:01:04,487",an ancient force of infinite destruction‎.
tt1981115,"00:01:07,657","00:01:08,783",Malekith‎.
tt1981115,"00:01:08,950","00:01:10,660",Asgard's forces are upon us‎.
tt1981115,"00:01:19,085","00:01:23,381","The noble armies of Asgard‎, led by my father‎, King Bor‎,"
tt1981115,"00:01:23,506","00:01:26,425",waged a mighty war against these creatures‎.
tt1981115,"00:01:37,395","00:01:39,689",Send in the Cursed‎!
tt1981115,"00:01:56,497","00:01:59,350","As the Nine Worlds converged above him‎,"
tt1981115,"00:01:59,375","00:02:03,838",Malekith could at last unleash the Aether‎.
tt1981115,"00:02:18,060","00:02:19,145",Ahh‎!
tt1981115,"00:02:21,981","00:02:25,234",But Asgard ripped the weapon from his grasp‎.
tt1981115,"00:02:26,277","00:02:28,446","Without it‎, the Dark Elves fell‎."
tt1981115,"00:02:43,336","00:02:44,921","With the battle all but lost‎,"
tt1981115,"00:02:45,213","00:02:47,590",Malekith sacrificed his own people
tt1981115,"00:02:48,424","00:02:52,470",in a desperate attempt to lay waste to Asgard's army‎.
tt1981115,"00:02:55,306","00:02:57,642",Their deaths will mean our survival‎.
tt1981115,"00:02:59,101","00:03:01,103",This war is far from over‎.
tt1981115,"00:03:08,736","00:03:14,325","Malekith was vanquished‎, and the Aether was no more‎."
tt1981115,"00:03:15,368","00:03:17,245",Or so we were led to believe‎.
tt1981115,"00:03:18,704","00:03:22,041","Sire‎, the Aether‎. Shall we destroy it‎?"
tt1981115,"00:03:22,708","00:03:25,086",If only we could‎.
tt1981115,"00:03:25,253","00:03:27,088",But its power is too great‎.
tt1981115,"00:03:27,797","00:03:30,174",Bury it deep‎.
tt1981115,"00:03:30,549","00:03:32,718",Somewhere no one will ever find it‎.
tt1981115,"00:04:14,510","00:04:15,553",Loki‎.
tt1981115,"00:04:16,053","00:04:17,263","Hello‎, Mother‎."
tt1981115,"00:04:18,097","00:04:19,640",Have I made you proud‎?
tt1981115,"00:04:19,807","00:04:22,184","Please‎, don't make this worse‎."
tt1981115,"00:04:22,518","00:04:24,103","Define ""worse‎."""
tt1981115,"00:04:24,270","00:04:25,855",Enough‎!
tt1981115,"00:04:26,022","00:04:28,316",I will speak to the prisoner alone‎.
tt1981115,"00:04:42,371","00:04:44,707",I really don't see what all the fuss is about‎.
tt1981115,"00:04:44,874","00:04:48,252",Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes‎?
tt1981115,"00:04:48,377","00:04:51,213","Wherever you go‎, there is war‎, ruin‎,"
tt1981115,"00:04:51,881","00:04:53,382",and death‎.
tt1981115,"00:04:53,549","00:04:57,762",I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent God‎.
tt1981115,"00:04:58,637","00:05:00,097",Just like you‎.
tt1981115,"00:05:00,431","00:05:04,060","We are not gods‎. We are born‎, we live‎, we die‎."
tt1981115,"00:05:04,435","00:05:06,604",Just as humans do‎.
tt1981115,"00:05:07,563","00:05:09,940","Give or take 5‎,000 years‎."
tt1981115,"00:05:10,107","00:05:13,861",All this because Loki desires a throne‎.
tt1981115,"00:05:14,028","00:05:15,363",It is my birthright‎.
tt1981115,"00:05:15,529","00:05:18,866",Your birthright was to die
tt1981115,"00:05:19,367","00:05:20,910",as a child‎.
tt1981115,"00:05:22,036","00:05:24,497",Cast out onto a frozen rock‎.
tt1981115,"00:05:26,415","00:05:28,626","If I had not taken you in‎,"
tt1981115,"00:05:28,793","00:05:31,420",you would not be here now to hate me‎.
tt1981115,"00:05:31,629","00:05:33,773","If I am for the axe‎, then for mercy's sake‎,"
tt1981115,"00:05:33,798","00:05:36,300",just swing it‎.
tt1981115,"00:05:36,842","00:05:38,652","It's not that I don't love our little talks‎,"
tt1981115,"00:05:38,677","00:05:40,596",it's just‎.‎.‎.
tt1981115,"00:05:41,680","00:05:43,349",I don't love them‎.
tt1981115,"00:05:43,516","00:05:45,743","Frigga is the only reason you're still alive‎,"
tt1981115,"00:05:45,768","00:05:47,186",and you will never see her again‎.
tt1981115,"00:05:48,104","00:05:52,400",You will spend the rest of your days in the dungeons‎.
tt1981115,"00:05:55,528","00:05:57,655",And what of Thor‎?
tt1981115,"00:05:58,280","00:06:01,867",You'll make that witless oaf king while I rot in chains‎.
tt1981115,"00:06:02,034","00:06:05,538",Thor must strive to undo the damage you have done‎.
tt1981115,"00:06:05,704","00:06:07,224",He will bring order to the Nine Realms
tt1981115,"00:06:07,373","00:06:09,333","and then‎, yes‎.‎.‎."
tt1981115,"00:06:10,251","00:06:12,169",He will be king‎.
tt1981115,"00:06:21,887","00:06:23,013",‎- Ah‎!
tt1981115,"00:06:59,550","00:07:01,260",I've got this completely under control‎!
tt1981115,"00:07:01,427","00:07:03,471",Is that why everything is on fire‎?
tt1981115,"00:07:18,444","00:07:19,445",Ah‎!
tt1981115,"00:07:27,495","00:07:29,038",You're welcome‎.
tt1981115,"00:07:31,707","00:07:32,708",Ha‎!
tt1981115,"00:07:50,726","00:07:51,769",All yours‎.
tt1981115,"00:08:14,375","00:08:15,376",Hello‎.
tt1981115,"00:08:18,754","00:08:20,297",I accept your surrender‎.
tt1981115,"00:08:33,185","00:08:34,520",Anyone else‎?
tt1981115,"00:08:42,403","00:08:45,948",Perhaps next time we should start with the big one‎.
tt1981115,"00:08:46,991","00:08:49,159",Keep moving‎. Come on‎!
tt1981115,"00:09:00,629","00:09:03,090",Keep moving‎. Go ahead of me‎. Don't you turn around‎!
tt1981115,"00:09:04,133","00:09:05,884",Where do we go next‎?
tt1981115,"00:09:06,051","00:09:10,014","Hogan‎, the peace is nearly won across the Nine Realms‎."
tt1981115,"00:09:11,140","00:09:13,684","You should stay here‎. Be with your people‎, where your heart is‎."
tt1981115,"00:09:13,851","00:09:15,436",Asgard can wait‎.
tt1981115,"00:09:16,854","00:09:18,814",You have my thanks‎.
tt1981115,"00:09:19,607","00:09:21,650",As you have mine‎.
tt1981115,"00:09:25,863","00:09:27,448","Heimdall‎, when you're ready‎."
tt1981115,"00:10:12,451","00:10:14,370",Is Vanaheim secure‎?
tt1981115,"00:10:14,536","00:10:15,996",As are Nornheim and Ria‎.
tt1981115,"00:10:16,246","00:10:18,846",Though our work would have gone more quickly with you at the fore‎.
tt1981115,"00:10:19,583","00:10:23,879",You must think I'm a piece of bread that needs to be buttered so heavily‎.
tt1981115,"00:10:24,254","00:10:26,131",That was not my intent‎.
tt1981115,"00:10:26,423","00:10:28,692","For the first time since Bifrost was destroyed‎,"
tt1981115,"00:10:28,717","00:10:30,511",the Nine Realms are at peace‎.
tt1981115,"00:10:30,678","00:10:33,097",They're well reminded of our strength
tt1981115,"00:10:33,263","00:10:37,951",and you have earned their respect and my gratitude‎.
tt1981115,"00:10:37,976","00:10:39,103",Thank you‎.
tt1981115,"00:10:39,978","00:10:41,730",Nothing out of order
tt1981115,"00:10:41,980","00:10:45,025",except your confused and distracted heart‎.
tt1981115,"00:10:45,192","00:10:47,444","This isn't about Jane Foster‎, Father‎."
tt1981115,"00:10:47,861","00:10:49,501","Human lives are fleeting‎, they're nothing‎."
tt1981115,"00:10:49,655","00:10:51,695",You'd be better served by what lies in front of you‎.
tt1981115,"00:10:54,375","00:10:56,095","I'm telling you this‎, not as the Allfather‎,"
tt1981115,"00:10:56,120","00:10:57,221",but as your father‎.
tt1981115,"00:10:57,246","00:10:58,247",You are ready‎.
tt1981115,"00:10:58,580","00:11:00,374",The time has come for you to take the throne‎.
tt1981115,"00:11:00,499","00:11:02,251",Embrace and celebrate what you've won‎.
tt1981115,"00:11:02,835","00:11:04,436",Join your warriors‎.
tt1981115,"00:11:04,461","00:11:06,922","Eat and drink‎, revel in their celebration‎."
tt1981115,"00:11:08,048","00:11:10,384",At least pretend to enjoy yourself‎.
tt1981115,"00:11:55,220","00:11:56,555",Another‎!
tt1981115,"00:12:12,863","00:12:15,866",There was a time when you would celebrate for weeks‎.
tt1981115,"00:12:17,201","00:12:20,287",I remember you celebrated the Battle of Harokin
tt1981115,"00:12:20,412","00:12:22,664",so much that you nearly started the second‎.
tt1981115,"00:12:23,332","00:12:25,334","Well‎, the first was so much fun‎."
tt1981115,"00:12:31,799","00:12:33,842",Take a drink with me‎.
tt1981115,"00:12:33,967","00:12:37,012","Surely‎, the Allfather could have no further task for you tonight‎."
tt1981115,"00:12:37,179","00:12:39,014","No‎, this is one I set myself‎."
tt1981115,"00:12:40,766","00:12:44,061",It does not go unnoticed that you disappear each night‎.
tt1981115,"00:12:44,436","00:12:46,438",There are nine realms‎.
tt1981115,"00:12:46,605","00:12:49,566",The future king of Asgard must focus on more than one‎.
tt1981115,"00:12:54,655","00:12:56,465",I thank you for your sword
tt1981115,"00:12:56,490","00:12:59,618",and for your counsel good Lady‎.
tt1981115,"00:13:20,097","00:13:21,098",Hi‎.
tt1981115,"00:13:21,932","00:13:23,433",Hi‎.
tt1981115,"00:13:23,725","00:13:24,925","So‎, what's the story with you‎?"
tt1981115,"00:13:25,602","00:13:27,704",Why does there have to be a story‎? There's no story‎.
tt1981115,"00:13:27,729","00:13:30,040",You spent the first ten minutes of our date
tt1981115,"00:13:30,065","00:13:32,025",hiding behind a menu that has three choices on it‎.
tt1981115,"00:13:32,609","00:13:34,528","It's either chicken‎, vegetarian‎, or fish‎, Jane‎."
tt1981115,"00:13:34,903","00:13:36,738",I think there's a story
tt1981115,"00:13:36,905","00:13:40,075",and I'm thinking the story involves a guy‎.
tt1981115,"00:13:40,742","00:13:42,077",It's complicated‎.
tt1981115,"00:13:42,244","00:13:43,412",Is he still around‎?
tt1981115,"00:13:43,620","00:13:45,539","No‎, he‎.‎.‎."
tt1981115,"00:13:46,039","00:13:47,207",Went away‎.
tt1981115,"00:13:47,374","00:13:48,750",I've been there‎.
tt1981115,"00:13:48,917","00:13:50,961","The going away‎. It's hard‎, isn't it‎?"
tt1981115,"00:13:51,253","00:13:52,462",I was seeing a woman
tt1981115,"00:13:52,754","00:13:54,423",and she took a job in New York‎.
tt1981115,"00:13:55,090","00:13:56,884","Eventually‎, the distance killed it‎."
tt1981115,"00:13:57,092","00:14:00,429",And the fact that she kept sleeping with other dudes‎.
tt1981115,"00:14:00,596","00:14:02,180","‎- No‎! ‎- Oh‎, so many‎."
tt1981115,"00:14:03,599","00:14:06,351","Hi‎. Could we get some wine‎, please‎?"
tt1981115,"00:14:06,518","00:14:07,561","Sure‎, I'd love some‎."
tt1981115,"00:14:07,686","00:14:09,271","Richard‎, this is Darcy‎."
tt1981115,"00:14:10,314","00:14:11,773",What are you doing here‎?
tt1981115,"00:14:13,984","00:14:14,985",Oh‎. Hello‎.
tt1981115,"00:14:15,235","00:14:18,822","So‎, I show up to work at the lab your mom's house‎,"
tt1981115,"00:14:18,947","00:14:22,659","fully expecting you to be moping around in your pajamas‎,"
tt1981115,"00:14:22,784","00:14:24,494",eating ice cream and obsessing about‎.‎.‎.
tt1981115,"00:14:24,661","00:14:25,662",You know who‎.
tt1981115,"00:14:25,829","00:14:26,872",Ah‎.
tt1981115,"00:14:26,997","00:14:29,416",But you're not‎. You're wearing lady clothes‎.
tt1981115,"00:14:29,541","00:14:31,126","You even showered‎, didn't you‎? You smell good‎."
tt1981115,"00:14:31,151","00:14:32,311",Is there a point to all this‎?
tt1981115,"00:14:32,336","00:14:34,438",Because there really needs to be a point to all this‎.
tt1981115,"00:14:34,463","00:14:35,672",Right‎.
tt1981115,"00:14:36,214","00:14:38,774",You know all that scientific equipment you don't look at anymore‎?
tt1981115,"00:14:39,301","00:14:41,261",You might want to start looking at it again‎.
tt1981115,"00:14:41,386","00:14:43,430",This is the reason we came all the way out here‎.
tt1981115,"00:14:43,555","00:14:44,615",It's malfunctioning‎.
tt1981115,"00:14:44,640","00:14:45,641",That's what I said‎.
tt1981115,"00:14:47,184","00:14:48,660",That's what I did‎.
tt1981115,"00:14:48,685","00:14:50,646",I thought you would do something a little more scientific‎.
tt1981115,"00:14:50,812","00:14:52,414","‎- I'm sure it's nothing‎. ‎- Yeah‎, it's‎.‎.‎."
tt1981115,"00:14:52,439","00:14:53,607",it doesn't look like nothing‎.
tt1981115,"00:14:53,732","00:14:56,252",It kind of looks like the readings that Erik was rambling about‎.
tt1981115,"00:14:56,276","00:14:57,361",Our friend Erik
tt1981115,"00:14:57,986","00:14:59,488",kind of went banana balls‎.
tt1981115,"00:14:59,613","00:15:00,631",He's not interested‎.
tt1981115,"00:15:00,656","00:15:01,657",‎- I'm not interested‎. ‎- I'm interested‎.
tt1981115,"00:15:01,907","00:15:03,325",It's time for you to go now‎.
tt1981115,"00:15:04,701","00:15:05,786",Okay‎.
tt1981115,"00:15:08,997","00:15:10,223",Short but sweet‎.
tt1981115,"00:15:10,248","00:15:11,959",She needs help‎.
tt1981115,"00:15:15,337","00:15:17,172",I think I'm going to have the sea bass‎.
tt1981115,"00:15:17,339","00:15:19,216","Sea bass‎, yeah‎. Sea bass is good‎."
tt1981115,"00:15:20,258","00:15:24,680","Sea bass‎, sea bass‎, sea bass‎, sea bass‎, sea bass‎, sea bass‎."
tt1981115,"00:15:24,846","00:15:27,307",Sea bass‎.‎.‎.
tt1981115,"00:15:28,600","00:15:29,660",Sea bass‎.
tt1981115,"00:15:29,685","00:15:31,161",Jane‎?
tt1981115,"00:15:31,186","00:15:32,829","Maybe you should stop saying ""sea bass"""
tt1981115,"00:15:32,854","00:15:33,897",and go after your friend‎.
tt1981115,"00:15:34,898","00:15:36,024",This was so fun‎.
tt1981115,"00:15:37,025","00:15:38,944","I'll just stay here and say ""sea bass"" alone‎."
tt1981115,"00:15:46,827","00:15:47,828",And I hate you‎.
tt1981115,"00:15:48,620","00:15:50,580",What‎? I said he was cute‎.
tt1981115,"00:15:50,914","00:15:52,708",Just shut up and drive‎.
tt1981115,"00:16:01,842","00:16:03,163",‎- You need to take the next left‎.
tt1981115,"00:16:04,302","00:16:06,054",‎- Who's he‎? ‎- He's my intern‎.
tt1981115,"00:16:06,596","00:16:08,390","‎- You have an intern‎? ‎- Oh‎, yeah‎."
tt1981115,"00:16:08,640","00:16:10,517","Hello‎, Dr‎. Foster‎."
tt1981115,"00:16:10,642","00:16:12,483",It's such a great honor to be working with you‎.
tt1981115,"00:16:12,728","00:16:14,855",Right‎. I have to call Erik‎.
tt1981115,"00:16:14,980","00:16:16,314","Oh‎, take a right‎."
tt1981115,"00:16:18,567","00:16:19,651",And a left‎.
tt1981115,"00:16:21,737","00:16:24,698",I have totally mastered driving in London‎.
tt1981115,"00:16:24,823","00:16:28,326","Hi‎, Erik‎. It's me again‎. Where are you‎?"
tt1981115,"00:16:28,452","00:16:31,372","I came here because you said you were onto something‎, and then you vanish‎."
tt1981115,"00:16:31,496","00:16:32,914",I'm here at Stonehenge
tt1981115,"00:16:33,081","00:16:36,251",for what has been an interesting unfolding of events today‎.
tt1981115,"00:16:36,585","00:16:38,145",The police were called to the scene
tt1981115,"00:16:38,170","00:16:39,730",shortly after 11 A‎.M‎. this morning
tt1981115,"00:16:39,755","00:16:43,233",after a seemingly harmless rambler approached the area
tt1981115,"00:16:43,258","00:16:46,053","then‎, decided to strip naked and effectively"
tt1981115,"00:16:46,178","00:16:48,305",terrorize tourists there with scientific equipment
tt1981115,"00:16:48,597","00:16:51,308",whilst shouting that he was trying to save them‎.
tt1981115,"00:16:51,850","00:16:55,746","The man‎, later identified as noted astrophysicist Dr‎. Erik Selvig"
tt1981115,"00:16:55,771","00:16:58,398",has been called in for questioning by police‎.
tt1981115,"00:17:00,650","00:17:02,444","Come on‎, this is exciting‎."
tt1981115,"00:17:03,111","00:17:04,738",Look‎! The intern is excited‎.
tt1981115,"00:17:04,946","00:17:06,073","""Ian‎."""
tt1981115,"00:17:06,198","00:17:07,716",Do you want the phase meter‎?
tt1981115,"00:17:07,741","00:17:09,201",‎- No‎. ‎- Bring the phase meter‎.
tt1981115,"00:17:10,118","00:17:11,161",The toaster‎-looking thing‎.
tt1981115,"00:17:11,328","00:17:13,872",Yeah‎. I know what the phase meter is‎.
tt1981115,"00:17:21,546","00:17:23,982",How do I change the ring‎-tone on this thing‎?
tt1981115,"00:17:24,007","00:17:26,026",An astrophysicist with three degrees
tt1981115,"00:17:26,051","00:17:27,803",should be able to change her own ring‎-tone‎.
tt1981115,"00:17:27,928","00:17:29,446",Why are you calling me‎?
tt1981115,"00:17:29,471","00:17:31,782",I didn't want to shout‎. Intern says it's this way‎.
tt1981115,"00:17:31,807","00:17:33,850","‎- ""Ian‎."" My name is Ian‎. ‎- Shh‎."
tt1981115,"00:17:47,364","00:17:51,034",I am not getting stabbed in the name of science‎.
tt1981115,"00:17:51,159","00:17:52,719","It's okay‎, we're Americans‎."
tt1981115,"00:17:52,744","00:17:54,763",Is that supposed to make them like us‎?
tt1981115,"00:17:54,788","00:17:56,540",‎- They'll make it go away‎. ‎- Shh‎.
tt1981115,"00:17:58,875","00:18:00,460","Oh‎, they're kids‎."
tt1981115,"00:18:00,794","00:18:01,920",Are you the police‎?
tt1981115,"00:18:02,546","00:18:05,257","No‎, we're scientists‎. Well‎, I am‎."
tt1981115,"00:18:05,549","00:18:06,633",Thanks‎.
tt1981115,"00:18:06,758","00:18:08,426",We just found it‎.
tt1981115,"00:18:10,637","00:18:11,847",Can you show us‎?
tt1981115,"00:18:38,331","00:18:40,834",That doesn't seem right‎.
tt1981115,"00:18:57,726","00:18:58,894",Where'd it go‎?
tt1981115,"00:19:12,449","00:19:13,450",That's‎.‎.‎.
tt1981115,"00:19:14,034","00:19:15,118",That's incredible‎!
tt1981115,"00:19:28,840","00:19:30,258",What happened‎?
tt1981115,"00:19:30,425","00:19:31,801",Sometimes they come back‎.
tt1981115,"00:19:32,093","00:19:33,511",Sometimes they don't‎.
tt1981115,"00:19:36,264","00:19:37,682",I want to throw something‎!
tt1981115,"00:19:37,807","00:19:38,934","Jane‎, give me your shoe‎."
tt1981115,"00:19:41,436","00:19:43,730",I haven't seen readings like this since‎.‎.‎.
tt1981115,"00:19:44,356","00:19:46,483",Since‎.‎.‎. New Mexico‎?
tt1981115,"00:19:51,029","00:19:52,948",Don't touch anything‎!
tt1981115,"00:19:55,700","00:19:57,285",Give me your shoe‎.
tt1981115,"00:20:02,916","00:20:04,125",Oh‎.
tt1981115,"00:20:18,348","00:20:20,809",Were those the car keys‎?
tt1981115,"00:20:49,170","00:20:50,672",Whoa‎. Ah‎!
tt1981115,"00:20:52,674","00:20:54,175",Oh‎!
tt1981115,"00:20:58,513","00:20:59,514",Darcy‎!
tt1981115,"00:21:46,728","00:21:47,729",Oh‎!
tt1981115,"00:23:00,552","00:23:02,804",The Aether awakens us‎.
tt1981115,"00:23:02,971","00:23:06,433",The Convergence returns‎.
tt1981115,"00:23:21,156","00:23:22,824",You're late‎.
tt1981115,"00:23:23,908","00:23:27,162",Merriment can sometimes be a heavier burden than battle‎.
tt1981115,"00:23:27,328","00:23:28,968",Then you're doing one of them incorrectly‎.
tt1981115,"00:23:29,747","00:23:31,666",Perhaps‎.
tt1981115,"00:23:31,833","00:23:33,668",How fare the stars‎?
tt1981115,"00:23:33,835","00:23:35,503",Heimdall Still shining‎.
tt1981115,"00:23:35,670","00:23:38,465","From here‎, I can see nine realms and ten trillion souls‎."
tt1981115,"00:23:43,344","00:23:46,097",Do you recall what I taught you of the Convergence‎?
tt1981115,"00:23:46,264","00:23:47,348",Yes‎.
tt1981115,"00:23:47,599","00:23:49,851",The alignment of the worlds‎.
tt1981115,"00:23:50,018","00:23:51,728","It approaches‎, doesn't it‎?"
tt1981115,"00:23:51,978","00:23:55,857",The universe hasn't seen this marvel since before my watch began‎.
tt1981115,"00:23:56,900","00:24:00,111",Few can sense it‎. Even fewer can see it‎.
tt1981115,"00:24:01,529","00:24:04,073","But while its effects can be dangerous‎,"
tt1981115,"00:24:04,908","00:24:07,744",it is truly beautiful‎.
tt1981115,"00:24:09,037","00:24:10,555",I see nothing‎.
tt1981115,"00:24:10,580","00:24:14,209","Or‎, perhaps‎, that is not the beauty you seek‎."
tt1981115,"00:24:20,048","00:24:21,382",How is she‎?
tt1981115,"00:24:21,549","00:24:23,468","She's quite clever‎, your mortal‎."
tt1981115,"00:24:23,593","00:24:24,903","She doesn't know it yet‎,"
tt1981115,"00:24:24,928","00:24:27,430",but she studies the Convergence as well‎.
tt1981115,"00:24:27,597","00:24:28,806",Even‎.
tt1981115,"00:24:30,558","00:24:31,976",What‎?
tt1981115,"00:24:34,812","00:24:36,231",I can't see her‎.
tt1981115,"00:25:15,645","00:25:18,231",Jane‎!
tt1981115,"00:25:18,815","00:25:20,108",Where the hell were you‎?
tt1981115,"00:25:20,441","00:25:21,918",Tell me you didn't call the police‎.
tt1981115,"00:25:21,943","00:25:23,069",What was I supposed to do‎?
tt1981115,"00:25:23,194","00:25:25,046",‎- Not call the police‎. ‎- I was freaking out‎.
tt1981115,"00:25:25,071","00:25:26,339","You call the cops‎, they call the Feds‎."
tt1981115,"00:25:26,364","00:25:28,283","Next thing you know‎, we have S‎.H‎.I‎.E‎.L‎.D‎. crawling all over‎."
tt1981115,"00:25:28,491","00:25:30,009","‎- ""Area 51‎-ing"" the place‎. ‎- Jane‎."
tt1981115,"00:25:30,034","00:25:32,178",We had a stable gravitation anomaly‎.
tt1981115,"00:25:32,203","00:25:33,496",We had unimpeded access‎.
tt1981115,"00:25:33,830","00:25:36,124",Our only competition was ten years old‎!
tt1981115,"00:25:36,291","00:25:37,834",Jane‎! You were gone for five hours‎.
tt1981115,"00:25:38,376","00:25:39,627",What‎?
tt1981115,"00:25:46,467","00:25:48,136",That's weird‎.
tt1981115,"00:26:09,699","00:26:11,117",Typical‎.
tt1981115,"00:26:11,868","00:26:12,910",Jane‎.
tt1981115,"00:26:15,580","00:26:18,333",Sorry‎. I just needed to make sure you were real‎.
tt1981115,"00:26:18,499","00:26:20,001",It's been a very strange day‎.
tt1981115,"00:26:20,168","00:26:21,669","I am‎. Jane‎, what‎.‎.‎."
tt1981115,"00:26:22,086","00:26:23,129",Where were you‎?
tt1981115,"00:26:23,338","00:26:24,339",Where were you‎?
tt1981115,"00:26:25,256","00:26:26,591",Heimdall cannot see you‎.
tt1981115,"00:26:26,758","00:26:28,509",I was right here where you left me‎.
tt1981115,"00:26:28,760","00:26:30,845","I was waiting‎, and then I was crying"
tt1981115,"00:26:30,970","00:26:32,513",and then I went out looking for you‎.
tt1981115,"00:26:32,680","00:26:34,223",You said you were coming back‎.
tt1981115,"00:26:34,390","00:26:36,726","I know‎. I know‎, but the Bifrost was destroyed‎."
tt1981115,"00:26:36,893","00:26:38,436",The Nine Realms erupted into chaos‎.
tt1981115,"00:26:38,561","00:26:40,730","Wars were raging‎, marauders were pillaging‎."
tt1981115,"00:26:41,272","00:26:42,899",I had to put an end to the slaughter‎.
tt1981115,"00:26:44,484","00:26:48,296","As excuses go‎, it's not terrible‎."
tt1981115,"00:26:48,321","00:26:51,157",But I saw you on TV‎. You were in New York‎!
tt1981115,"00:26:52,075","00:26:54,844","Jane‎, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world"
tt1981115,"00:26:54,869","00:26:56,663",but I was wrong‎.
tt1981115,"00:26:56,829","00:26:58,706",I was a fool‎.
tt1981115,"00:26:59,582","00:27:03,044",But I believe that fate brought us together‎.
tt1981115,"00:27:05,129","00:27:08,174","Jane‎, I don't know where you were‎, or what happened‎, but I do know this‎.‎.‎."
tt1981115,"00:27:09,008","00:27:10,009",What‎?
tt1981115,"00:27:11,260","00:27:12,303",I know‎.‎.‎.
tt1981115,"00:27:13,513","00:27:14,639",You do‎?
tt1981115,"00:27:16,140","00:27:17,225",Do what‎?
tt1981115,"00:27:17,850","00:27:18,976",What‎?
tt1981115,"00:27:19,560","00:27:20,561",Hey‎!
tt1981115,"00:27:22,313","00:27:23,773",Is this you‎?
tt1981115,"00:27:28,002","00:27:29,962","Uh‎, we're kind of in the middle of something here‎."
tt1981115,"00:27:29,987","00:27:32,657","Um‎, I'm pretty sure we are getting arrested‎."
tt1981115,"00:27:32,907","00:27:33,908",Hold that thought‎.
tt1981115,"00:27:35,326","00:27:38,971","Look at you‎, still all muscly and everything‎."
tt1981115,"00:27:38,996","00:27:40,723",How's space‎?
tt1981115,"00:27:40,748","00:27:42,875",Space is fine‎.
tt1981115,"00:27:43,000","00:27:44,252",Excuse me‎.
tt1981115,"00:27:44,419","00:27:45,561",‎- Are you Jane Foster‎? ‎- Yes‎.
tt1981115,"00:27:45,586","00:27:46,587",Do you know this man‎?
tt1981115,"00:27:48,131","00:27:49,257",He's my intern‎.
tt1981115,"00:27:50,425","00:27:51,592",My intern's intern‎.
tt1981115,"00:27:51,718","00:27:53,778","This is private property and you're trespassing‎, the lot of you‎."
tt1981115,"00:27:53,803","00:27:55,096",You'll have to come with me‎.
tt1981115,"00:28:00,893","00:28:01,894",Jane‎.
tt1981115,"00:28:02,687","00:28:04,647",‎- Jane‎. ‎- Thor‎?
tt1981115,"00:28:04,981","00:28:05,982",Are you all right‎?
tt1981115,"00:28:06,190","00:28:07,358",What just happened‎?
tt1981115,"00:28:07,942","00:28:10,503",Place your hands on your heads‎. Step back‎.
tt1981115,"00:28:10,528","00:28:11,629",This woman is unwell‎.
tt1981115,"00:28:11,654","00:28:12,655",She's dangerous‎.
tt1981115,"00:28:13,656","00:28:14,991",So am I‎.
tt1981115,"00:28:15,992","00:28:18,119",Requesting armed response officers to scene‎.
tt1981115,"00:28:18,494","00:28:20,121",‎- Hold on to me‎. ‎- What are you doing‎?
tt1981115,"00:28:28,463","00:28:30,506",Holy shit‎.
tt1981115,"00:28:57,992","00:29:00,036",We have to do that again‎.
tt1981115,"00:29:00,495","00:29:01,496",Hi‎.
tt1981115,"00:29:04,332","00:29:06,501",Welcome to Asgard‎.
tt1981115,"00:29:27,939","00:29:30,525","Look upon my legacy‎, Algrim‎."
tt1981115,"00:29:32,360","00:29:34,737",I can barely remember a time before the light‎.
tt1981115,"00:29:35,488","00:29:38,658",Our survival will be your legacy‎.
tt1981115,"00:29:40,618","00:29:44,347",The Asgardians will suffer as we have suffered‎.
tt1981115,"00:29:44,372","00:29:45,681",I will reclaim the Aether‎.
tt1981115,"00:29:45,706","00:29:47,016",I will restore our world‎.
tt1981115,"00:29:47,041","00:29:49,752",And I will put an end to this poisoned universe‎.
tt1981115,"00:29:58,052","00:29:59,111",What's that‎?
tt1981115,"00:29:59,136","00:30:00,179",Be still‎.
tt1981115,"00:30:07,728","00:30:10,106",This is not of Earth‎. What is it‎?
tt1981115,"00:30:10,898","00:30:12,567",We do not know‎.
tt1981115,"00:30:13,276","00:30:17,238",But she will not survive the amount of energy surging within her‎.
tt1981115,"00:30:22,785","00:30:24,465","That's a quantum field generator‎, isn't it‎?"
tt1981115,"00:30:25,079","00:30:26,914",It's a soul forge‎.
tt1981115,"00:30:27,039","00:30:30,251",Does a soul forge transfer molecular energy from one place to another‎?
tt1981115,"00:30:33,129","00:30:34,171",Yes‎.
tt1981115,"00:30:34,297","00:30:36,048",Quantum field generator‎.
tt1981115,"00:30:37,174","00:30:40,094",My words are mere noises to you that you ignore them completely‎?
tt1981115,"00:30:40,261","00:30:41,387",She is ill‎.
tt1981115,"00:30:41,512","00:30:43,764",She is mortal‎.
tt1981115,"00:30:43,931","00:30:45,474",Illness is their defining trait‎.
tt1981115,"00:30:45,600","00:30:47,285",I brought her here because we can help her‎.
tt1981115,"00:30:47,310","00:30:49,228",She does not belong here in Asgard
tt1981115,"00:30:49,395","00:30:52,773",any more than a goat belongs at a banquet table‎.
tt1981115,"00:30:52,940","00:30:56,252",Did he just‎.‎.‎. Who do you think you are‎?
tt1981115,"00:30:56,277","00:30:58,821","I am Odin‎, King of Asgard‎."
tt1981115,"00:30:58,988","00:31:00,531",Protector of the Nine Realms‎.
tt1981115,"00:31:01,407","00:31:03,284","Oh‎. Well‎, I'm‎.‎.‎."
tt1981115,"00:31:03,451","00:31:06,287","I know very well who you are‎, Jane Foster‎."
tt1981115,"00:31:07,246","00:31:08,623",You told your dad about me‎?
tt1981115,"00:31:09,498","00:31:10,958","Something is within her‎, Father‎."
tt1981115,"00:31:11,083","00:31:12,404",Something I have not seen before‎.
tt1981115,"00:31:12,418","00:31:13,628",Her world has its healers‎.
tt1981115,"00:31:13,753","00:31:15,673","They are called ""doctors‎."" Let them deal with it‎."
tt1981115,"00:31:15,796","00:31:17,590","Guards‎, take her back to Midgard‎."
tt1981115,"00:31:18,966","00:31:20,468","No‎, I would not‎.‎.‎."
tt1981115,"00:31:22,303","00:31:23,387",touch her‎.
tt1981115,"00:31:23,512","00:31:24,805","Jane‎, are you all right‎?"
tt1981115,"00:31:25,348","00:31:26,474",Yeah‎.
tt1981115,"00:31:30,186","00:31:31,437",It's impossible‎.
tt1981115,"00:31:32,647","00:31:35,399",The infection‎.‎.‎. It's defending her‎.
tt1981115,"00:31:36,025","00:31:37,318",No‎.
tt1981115,"00:31:37,818","00:31:39,487",It's defending itself‎.
tt1981115,"00:31:40,529","00:31:42,531",Come with me‎.
tt1981115,"00:31:42,657","00:31:46,452",There are relics that pre‎-date the universe itself‎.
tt1981115,"00:31:46,619","00:31:50,498",What lies within her appears to be one of them‎.
tt1981115,"00:31:51,499","00:31:54,001",The Nine Realms are not eternal‎.
tt1981115,"00:31:54,168","00:31:56,671",They had a dawn as they will have a dusk‎.
tt1981115,"00:31:58,005","00:31:59,006",But before that dawn
tt1981115,"00:31:59,173","00:32:05,513","the dark forces‎, the Dark Elves‎, reigned absolute and unchallenged‎."
tt1981115,"00:32:07,473","00:32:08,766",Born of eternal night
tt1981115,"00:32:08,891","00:32:11,727","""the Dark Elves come to steal away the light‎."""
tt1981115,"00:32:12,186","00:32:15,665",I know these stories‎. Mother told them to us as children‎.
tt1981115,"00:32:15,690","00:32:19,001",Their leader Malekith made a weapon out of that darkness
tt1981115,"00:32:19,026","00:32:20,670",and it was called the Aether‎.
tt1981115,"00:32:20,695","00:32:23,798",While the other relics often appear as stones
tt1981115,"00:32:23,823","00:32:26,492",the Aether is fluid and ever changing‎.
tt1981115,"00:32:26,659","00:32:29,245",It changes matter into dark matter‎.
tt1981115,"00:32:29,370","00:32:32,957","It seeks out host bodies‎, drawing strength from their life‎-force‎."
tt1981115,"00:32:34,208","00:32:37,169",Malekith sought to use the Aether's power
tt1981115,"00:32:37,336","00:32:41,090",to return the universe to one of darkness‎.
tt1981115,"00:32:41,757","00:32:44,443","But‎, after eternities of bloodshed"
tt1981115,"00:32:44,468","00:32:47,054",my father Bor finally triumphed
tt1981115,"00:32:47,221","00:32:51,726",ushering in a peace that lasted thousands of years‎.
tt1981115,"00:32:52,727","00:32:53,894",What happened‎?
tt1981115,"00:32:55,187","00:32:57,106",He killed them all‎.
tt1981115,"00:32:57,231","00:32:59,458",Are you certain‎?
tt1981115,"00:32:59,483","00:33:01,563","The Aether was said to have been destroyed with them‎,"
tt1981115,"00:33:01,569","00:33:02,820",and yet here it is‎.
tt1981115,"00:33:04,238","00:33:06,407",The Dark Elves are dead‎.
tt1981115,"00:33:07,074","00:33:10,594",Does your book happen to mention how to get it out of me‎?
tt1981115,"00:33:10,619","00:33:11,620",No‎.
tt1981115,"00:33:12,621","00:33:14,248",It does not‎.
tt1981115,"00:33:24,091","00:33:26,969",The worlds are nearly aligned‎.
tt1981115,"00:33:32,391","00:33:34,143",You will be the last of the Kursed‎.
tt1981115,"00:33:35,311","00:33:36,937",Let my life be sacrificed‎.
tt1981115,"00:33:37,897","00:33:40,608","It is no less than our people did‎,"
tt1981115,"00:33:41,275","00:33:42,443",or you have done‎.
tt1981115,"00:33:50,242","00:33:52,203","You will become darkness‎,"
tt1981115,"00:33:53,412","00:33:57,124",cursed to this existence until it consumes you‎.
tt1981115,"00:34:02,379","00:34:06,258","Until then‎, no power our enemies possess can stop you‎."
tt1981115,"00:34:09,345","00:34:16,143",I will tear down their defenses and ensure your return to a universe reborn‎.
tt1981115,"00:34:38,374","00:34:41,377",Acting as caretakers to these scoundrels is beneath us‎.
tt1981115,"00:34:41,544","00:34:43,687","Oh‎, please‎! If they were beneath you‎,"
tt1981115,"00:34:43,712","00:34:45,840","my rotund friend‎, they'd all be dead‎."
tt1981115,"00:35:00,521","00:35:02,523",‎- Keep in line‎! ‎- Move it‎!
tt1981115,"00:35:04,024","00:35:07,695",Odin continues to bring me new friends‎.
tt1981115,"00:35:08,070","00:35:09,822",How thoughtful‎.
tt1981115,"00:35:10,072","00:35:13,534","The books I sent‎, do they not interest you‎?"
tt1981115,"00:35:14,034","00:35:17,388",Is that how I am to while away eternity‎? Reading‎?
tt1981115,"00:35:17,413","00:35:20,599","I've done everything in my power to make you comfortable‎, Loki‎."
tt1981115,"00:35:20,624","00:35:21,667",Have you‎?
tt1981115,"00:35:22,710","00:35:24,545",Does Odin share your concern‎?
tt1981115,"00:35:26,005","00:35:27,548",Does Thor‎?
tt1981115,"00:35:27,715","00:35:31,402","It must be so inconvenient‎, them asking after me day and night‎."
tt1981115,"00:35:31,427","00:35:34,555",You know full well it was your actions that brought you here‎.
tt1981115,"00:35:35,097","00:35:36,432",My actions‎?
tt1981115,"00:35:36,599","00:35:39,910",I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life‎.‎.‎.
tt1981115,"00:35:39,935","00:35:41,662",That I was born to be a king‎.
tt1981115,"00:35:41,687","00:35:43,706",A king‎?
tt1981115,"00:35:43,731","00:35:45,733",A true king admits his faults‎.
tt1981115,"00:35:45,858","00:35:47,298",What of the lives you took on Earth‎?
tt1981115,"00:35:47,443","00:35:49,086",A mere handful compared to the number
tt1981115,"00:35:49,111","00:35:50,905",that Odin has taken himself‎.
tt1981115,"00:35:51,071","00:35:53,741",‎- Your father‎.‎.‎. ‎- He's not my father‎!
tt1981115,"00:35:56,619","00:35:58,829",Then am I not your mother‎?
tt1981115,"00:36:04,043","00:36:06,003",You're not‎.
tt1981115,"00:36:09,798","00:36:14,762",You're always so perceptive about everyone but yourself‎.
tt1981115,"00:36:29,944","00:36:33,113","When you came for me‎, you knew I was in trouble‎."
tt1981115,"00:36:33,239","00:36:34,490",Heimdall had lost sight of you‎.
tt1981115,"00:36:34,615","00:36:36,283",You were no longer on Earth‎.
tt1981115,"00:36:36,450","00:36:37,743",How is that possible‎?
tt1981115,"00:36:37,952","00:36:39,970",I believe you were and you weren't‎.
tt1981115,"00:36:39,995","00:36:42,873",The Nine Realms travel within Yggdrasil
tt1981115,"00:36:43,165","00:36:46,418",orbiting Midgard much the way your planets orbit the sun‎.
tt1981115,"00:36:46,585","00:36:50,773","And every 5‎,000 years‎, the worlds align perfectly"
tt1981115,"00:36:50,798","00:36:53,008",and we call this the Convergence‎.
tt1981115,"00:36:55,135","00:36:58,806","During this time‎, the borders between worlds become blurred‎."
tt1981115,"00:36:59,473","00:37:02,268",It's possible you found one of these points‎.
tt1981115,"00:37:04,311","00:37:06,522",We are lucky that it remained open‎.
tt1981115,"00:37:06,689","00:37:10,943",Once the worlds pass out of alignment
tt1981115,"00:37:12,361","00:37:14,405",then the connection is lost‎.
tt1981115,"00:37:27,167","00:37:29,545",I like the way you explain things‎.
tt1981115,"00:37:31,839","00:37:33,215",What's going to happen to me‎?
tt1981115,"00:37:33,382","00:37:34,967","I'll find a way to save you‎, Jane‎."
tt1981115,"00:37:35,134","00:37:38,304",‎- Your father said there was‎.‎.‎. ‎- My father doesn't know everything‎.
tt1981115,"00:37:38,512","00:37:40,180",Don't let him hear you say that‎.
tt1981115,"00:37:41,557","00:37:44,326","Jane Foster‎.‎.‎. Please meet Frigga‎,"
tt1981115,"00:37:44,351","00:37:46,270","Queen of Asgard‎, and my mother‎."
tt1981115,"00:37:49,023","00:37:50,482",Hi‎.
tt1981115,"00:38:39,615","00:38:41,033",Move‎!
tt1981115,"00:39:27,621","00:39:28,872",To the dungeons‎!
tt1981115,"00:39:29,248","00:39:30,249",Come on‎!
tt1981115,"00:39:54,064","00:39:56,483",You might want to take the stairs to the left‎.
tt1981115,"00:40:07,536","00:40:08,871",The prisons‎.
tt1981115,"00:40:09,037","00:40:10,831",‎- Loki‎.‎.‎. ‎- Go‎.
tt1981115,"00:40:10,998","00:40:12,833",I will look after her‎.
tt1981115,"00:40:24,261","00:40:25,862",It's as if they resent being imprisoned‎!
tt1981115,"00:40:29,850","00:40:32,686",‎- There's no pleasing some creatures‎.
tt1981115,"00:40:40,694","00:40:42,855","Return to your cells‎, no further harm will come to you‎."
tt1981115,"00:40:43,030","00:40:44,198",You have my word‎.
tt1981115,"00:40:46,033","00:40:48,368","Very well‎, you do not have my word‎."
tt1981115,"00:40:58,253","00:41:00,255",Send a squadron to the weapons vault‎.
tt1981115,"00:41:00,380","00:41:02,925",Defend it at all costs‎. Secure the dungeon‎.
tt1981115,"00:41:03,091","00:41:04,676",‎- Odin‎. ‎- Frigga‎.
tt1981115,"00:41:05,552","00:41:06,553",Go‎!
tt1981115,"00:41:07,346","00:41:08,597",It's a skirmish‎.
tt1981115,"00:41:08,722","00:41:09,948",Nothing to fear‎.
tt1981115,"00:41:09,973","00:41:11,475",You've never been a very good liar‎.
tt1981115,"00:41:12,434","00:41:13,535",Take her to your chambers‎.
tt1981115,"00:41:13,560","00:41:15,437",I'll come for you when it's safe‎.
tt1981115,"00:41:15,562","00:41:17,122",You take care‎.
tt1981115,"00:41:17,147","00:41:18,268","Despite all I have survived‎,"
tt1981115,"00:41:19,066","00:41:21,777",my queen still worries over me‎.
tt1981115,"00:41:21,891","00:41:23,212",It's only because I worry over you
tt1981115,"00:41:23,237","00:41:25,072",that you have survived‎.
tt1981115,"00:41:27,574","00:41:28,784",Listen to me now‎.
tt1981115,"00:41:28,951","00:41:31,912","I need you to do everything I ask‎, no questions‎."
tt1981115,"00:41:32,037","00:41:33,205","Yes‎, ma'am‎."
tt1981115,"00:42:14,246","00:42:15,414",Oh‎!
tt1981115,"00:45:45,791","00:45:47,167",‎- Ow‎! ‎- Ah‎!
tt1981115,"00:46:42,764","00:46:45,892",The throne of Asgard is destroyed‎! To the king‎!
tt1981115,"00:47:01,700","00:47:02,701",Frigga‎.
tt1981115,"00:47:11,501","00:47:13,920","Stand down‎, creature‎,"
tt1981115,"00:47:14,087","00:47:15,772",and you may still survive this‎.
tt1981115,"00:47:15,797","00:47:17,883","I have survived worse‎, woman‎."
tt1981115,"00:47:19,342","00:47:20,719",Who are you‎?
tt1981115,"00:47:21,261","00:47:23,305",I am Malekith‎.
tt1981115,"00:47:23,471","00:47:26,099",And I would have what is mine‎.
tt1981115,"00:47:38,361","00:47:39,362",Ah‎!
tt1981115,"00:47:56,755","00:47:58,924","You have taken something‎, child‎."
tt1981115,"00:47:59,966","00:48:01,009",Give it back‎.
tt1981115,"00:48:15,398","00:48:16,483",Witch‎!
tt1981115,"00:48:20,195","00:48:21,696",Where is the Aether‎?
tt1981115,"00:48:21,821","00:48:24,115",I'll never tell you‎.
tt1981115,"00:48:25,116","00:48:26,326",I believe you‎.
tt1981115,"00:48:28,828","00:48:30,997",No‎!
tt1981115,"00:51:57,745","00:51:59,914","The universe rotates on a 5‎,000 year cycle"
tt1981115,"00:52:00,790","00:52:03,168","and once a cycle‎, all the worlds align‎."
tt1981115,"00:52:03,835","00:52:06,754",Imagine‎.‎.‎. Imagine that this is our world‎.
tt1981115,"00:52:07,505","00:52:09,549","Oh‎, thank you‎. And this is another world‎."
tt1981115,"00:52:09,716","00:52:11,676","Normally‎, they're separate‎."
tt1981115,"00:52:11,843","00:52:13,611","But during the Alignment‎,"
tt1981115,"00:52:13,636","00:52:17,182","everything is connected‎, all nine realms‎."
tt1981115,"00:52:17,348","00:52:19,576",All nine realms are passing through each other
tt1981115,"00:52:19,601","00:52:21,936","and gravity‎, light‎, and even matter‎,"
tt1981115,"00:52:22,228","00:52:24,647",is crashing from one world to the other‎.
tt1981115,"00:52:26,983","00:52:30,962","But if this happens to us now‎, the result will be cataclysmic‎."
tt1981115,"00:52:30,987","00:52:35,491",My gravimetric spikes can stabilize the focal point of the Convergence‎.
tt1981115,"00:52:36,201","00:52:38,553","This time‎, the Alignment"
tt1981115,"00:52:38,578","00:52:41,581",and all the other worlds would just pass us by‎.
tt1981115,"00:52:41,748","00:52:43,249",It's beautiful‎.
tt1981115,"00:52:44,751","00:52:46,920",It's simple‎. Any questions‎?
tt1981115,"00:52:50,048","00:52:51,090",Yeah‎.
tt1981115,"00:52:51,549","00:52:54,260",Can I have my shoe back‎?
tt1981115,"00:53:02,018","00:53:06,022",Heal‎. You will need your strength to reclaim the Aether‎.
tt1981115,"00:53:06,522","00:53:10,109","And when you wake‎, we will kill them all‎."
tt1981115,"00:53:45,687","00:53:46,980",Jane Foster‎?
tt1981115,"00:53:48,648","00:53:50,817",You need to come with us‎.
tt1981115,"00:53:52,068","00:53:55,154",We are still unable to restore the palace shields‎.
tt1981115,"00:53:55,280","00:53:56,698",Our artillery cannot detect them‎.
tt1981115,"00:53:56,823","00:53:58,616",Even Heimdall cannot see them‎.
tt1981115,"00:54:01,995","00:54:05,915","My king‎, we are all but defenseless‎."
tt1981115,"00:54:08,501","00:54:09,961",She's your prisoner now‎?
tt1981115,"00:54:12,338","00:54:13,673",Leave us‎.
tt1981115,"00:54:22,682","00:54:24,851",I do not wish to fight with you‎.
tt1981115,"00:54:25,351","00:54:27,161",Nor I with you‎.
tt1981115,"00:54:27,186","00:54:29,022",But I intend to pursue Malekith‎.
tt1981115,"00:54:29,188","00:54:30,481",We possess the Aether‎.
tt1981115,"00:54:31,149","00:54:32,358",Malekith will come to us‎.
tt1981115,"00:54:32,525","00:54:34,585","Yes‎, and he will destroy us‎."
tt1981115,"00:54:34,610","00:54:36,738",You overestimate the power of these creatures‎.
tt1981115,"00:54:36,863","00:54:39,198","No‎, I value our people's lives‎."
tt1981115,"00:54:39,365","00:54:42,660","I'll take Jane to the Dark World‎, and draw the enemy away from Asgard‎."
tt1981115,"00:54:43,411","00:54:45,680","When Malekith pulls the Aether from Jane‎,"
tt1981115,"00:54:45,705","00:54:47,707",it will be exposed and vulnerable‎.
tt1981115,"00:54:47,874","00:54:49,667",And I will destroy it and him‎.
tt1981115,"00:54:51,711","00:54:54,522","If you fail‎, you risk this weapon"
tt1981115,"00:54:54,547","00:54:56,382",falling into the hands of our enemies‎.
tt1981115,"00:54:56,507","00:54:58,885",The risk is far greater if we do nothing‎.
tt1981115,"00:54:59,010","00:55:00,970","His ship could be over our heads right now‎,"
tt1981115,"00:55:01,179","00:55:02,388",we would never even know it‎.
tt1981115,"00:55:02,555","00:55:03,781",If and when he comes
tt1981115,"00:55:03,806","00:55:08,036","his men will fall on 10‎,000 Asgardian blades‎."
tt1981115,"00:55:08,061","00:55:09,479",And how many of our men shall fall on theirs‎?
tt1981115,"00:55:09,604","00:55:11,564",As many as are needed‎!
tt1981115,"00:55:14,650","00:55:15,735",Ah‎!
tt1981115,"00:55:20,531","00:55:22,075",We Will fight‎!
tt1981115,"00:55:24,577","00:55:27,121",Till the last Asgardian breath‎.
tt1981115,"00:55:27,914","00:55:30,958",Till the last drop of Asgardian blood‎.
tt1981115,"00:55:33,086","00:55:36,214",Then how are you different from Malekith‎?
tt1981115,"00:55:39,425","00:55:42,011","The difference‎, my son‎, is that I will win‎."
tt1981115,"00:55:56,317","00:55:59,112","Jane isn't calling me back‎, Erik isn't calling me back‎,"
tt1981115,"00:55:59,237","00:56:01,155",stupid S‎.H‎.I‎.E‎.L‎.D‎. isn't calling me back‎.
tt1981115,"00:56:01,280","00:56:03,174",‎- What's S‎.H‎.I‎.E‎.L‎.D‎? ‎- It's a secret‎.
tt1981115,"00:56:03,199","00:56:05,118","Hey‎, Erik‎, it's Darcy again‎."
tt1981115,"00:56:05,243","00:56:08,037","Thor came back‎, he took Jane to Asgard‎,"
tt1981115,"00:56:08,287","00:56:11,808",and I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do‎.
tt1981115,"00:56:11,833","00:56:13,810",Something else went missing this week
tt1981115,"00:56:13,835","00:56:16,963",when astrophysicist Dr‎. Erik Selvig
tt1981115,"00:56:17,088","00:56:20,633",notable for his involvement in the alien invasion of New York
tt1981115,"00:56:20,800","00:56:22,093",streaked nude across‎.‎.‎.
tt1981115,"00:56:22,260","00:56:24,804","Darcy‎, you really need to look at this‎."
tt1981115,"00:56:24,971","00:56:26,197","Your friend‎, Erik‎.‎.‎."
tt1981115,"00:56:26,222","00:56:27,974",What was his last name again‎?
tt1981115,"00:56:28,933","00:56:32,311",And began shouting at visitors to the historic site‎.
tt1981115,"00:56:32,478","00:56:34,522",He was later taken into police custody
tt1981115,"00:56:35,148","00:56:37,442",for psychiatric evaluation‎.
tt1981115,"00:56:37,608","00:56:39,652",Police are still refusing to confirm‎.‎.‎.
tt1981115,"00:56:50,163","00:56:52,206",You were not at Odin's war council‎.
tt1981115,"00:56:52,331","00:56:54,667",The Bifrost is closed by your father's orders‎.
tt1981115,"00:56:54,876","00:56:57,545",No one is to come or to go‎.
tt1981115,"00:56:59,630","00:57:02,341",We face an enemy that is invisible even to me‎.
tt1981115,"00:57:02,508","00:57:06,220",What use is a guardian such as that‎?
tt1981115,"00:57:07,680","00:57:10,433","Malekith will return‎, you know this‎."
tt1981115,"00:57:12,977","00:57:14,020",I need your help‎.
tt1981115,"00:57:14,645","00:57:18,232",I cannot overrule my king's wishes‎. Not even for you‎.
tt1981115,"00:57:18,357","00:57:19,984",I'm not asking you to‎.
tt1981115,"00:57:20,193","00:57:22,528",The realms need their Allfather strong and unchallenged
tt1981115,"00:57:22,695","00:57:25,239",whether he is or not‎.
tt1981115,"00:57:25,406","00:57:27,175","But he is blinded‎, Heimdall"
tt1981115,"00:57:27,200","00:57:29,010",by hatred and by grief‎.
tt1981115,"00:57:29,035","00:57:30,761",As are we all‎.
tt1981115,"00:57:30,786","00:57:32,054",I see clearly enough‎.
tt1981115,"00:57:32,079","00:57:33,706",The risks are too great‎.
tt1981115,"00:57:33,998","00:57:36,709",Everything we do from here on is a risk‎.
tt1981115,"00:57:36,876","00:57:38,586",There is no other way‎.
tt1981115,"00:57:42,548","00:57:44,759",What do you require of me‎?
tt1981115,"00:57:44,884","00:57:48,429",What I'm about to ask of you is treason of the highest order‎.
tt1981115,"00:57:48,721","00:57:52,767",Success will bring us exile and failure shall mean our death‎.
tt1981115,"00:57:55,645","00:57:59,732",Malekith knew the Aether was here‎. He can sense its power‎.
tt1981115,"00:58:00,274","00:58:02,443","If we do nothing‎, he will come for it again"
tt1981115,"00:58:02,610","00:58:06,739","but this time‎, lay waste to all of Asgard‎."
tt1981115,"00:58:07,740","00:58:09,742",We must move Jane off‎-world‎.
tt1981115,"00:58:09,909","00:58:11,577",The Bifrost has been shut down
tt1981115,"00:58:11,702","00:58:13,412",and the Tesseract locked away in the vault‎.
tt1981115,"00:58:13,579","00:58:17,767",There are other paths off Asgard‎. Ways known only to a few‎.
tt1981115,"00:58:17,792","00:58:19,710","One‎, actually‎."
tt1981115,"00:58:21,796","00:58:23,548",No‎.
tt1981115,"00:58:27,927","00:58:31,239",Thor‎. After all this time
tt1981115,"00:58:31,264","00:58:33,933",and now you come to visit me‎.
tt1981115,"00:58:35,142","00:58:36,435",Why‎?
tt1981115,"00:58:37,770","00:58:40,815",Have you come to gloat‎? To mock‎?
tt1981115,"00:58:40,940","00:58:42,567","Loki‎, enough‎."
tt1981115,"00:58:42,984","00:58:44,819",No more illusions‎.
tt1981115,"00:58:51,993","00:58:54,078","Now you see me‎, brother‎."
tt1981115,"00:59:02,795","00:59:04,505",Did she suffer‎?
tt1981115,"00:59:04,630","00:59:06,966",I did not come here to share our grief‎.
tt1981115,"00:59:07,091","00:59:10,177",Instead I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament‎.
tt1981115,"00:59:11,596","00:59:12,805",Go on‎.
tt1981115,"00:59:12,972","00:59:15,700",I know you seek vengeance as much as I do‎.
tt1981115,"00:59:15,725","00:59:18,686",You help me escape Asgard and I will grant it to you‎.
tt1981115,"00:59:18,978","00:59:22,940","Vengeance and afterward‎, this cell‎."
tt1981115,"00:59:29,697","00:59:34,493",You must be truly desperate to come to me for help‎.
tt1981115,"00:59:36,162","00:59:37,805",What makes you think you can trust me‎?
tt1981115,"00:59:37,830","00:59:39,248",I don't‎.
tt1981115,"00:59:40,958","00:59:42,043",Mother did‎.
tt1981115,"00:59:43,336","00:59:45,838","But you should know that when we fought each other in the past‎,"
tt1981115,"00:59:46,672","00:59:48,190",I did so with a glimmer of hope
tt1981115,"00:59:48,215","00:59:50,092",that my brother was still in there somewhere‎.
tt1981115,"00:59:51,719","00:59:54,180",That hope no longer exists to protect you‎.
tt1981115,"00:59:55,014","00:59:58,392","You betray me‎, and I will kill you‎."
tt1981115,"01:00:01,062","01:00:02,396",Hmm‎.
tt1981115,"01:00:03,898","01:00:05,666",When do we start‎?
tt1981115,"01:00:05,691","01:00:07,084",He will betray you‎.
tt1981115,"01:00:07,109","01:00:08,736",He will try‎.
tt1981115,"01:00:13,324","01:00:15,701","This is so unlike you‎, brother‎."
tt1981115,"01:00:15,868","01:00:17,870",So clandestine‎.
tt1981115,"01:00:17,995","01:00:20,236",Are you sure you wouldn't rather just punch your way out‎?
tt1981115,"01:00:20,998","01:00:22,875","If you keep speaking‎, I just might‎."
tt1981115,"01:00:23,000","01:00:24,835",Fine‎. As you wish‎.
tt1981115,"01:00:25,211","01:00:26,379",I'm not even here‎.
tt1981115,"01:00:27,713","01:00:29,215",Is this better‎?
tt1981115,"01:00:29,382","01:00:31,884",It's better company at least‎.
tt1981115,"01:00:32,009","01:00:35,930","Still‎, we could be less conspicuous‎."
tt1981115,"01:00:37,515","01:00:39,850","Mmm‎, brother‎, you look ravishing‎."
tt1981115,"01:00:41,852","01:00:44,397",It will hurt no less when I kill you in this form‎.
tt1981115,"01:00:44,563","01:00:47,733",Very well‎. Perhaps you prefer one of your new companions
tt1981115,"01:00:47,900","01:00:49,944",given that you seem to like them so much‎.
tt1981115,"01:00:50,528","01:00:52,588","Oh‎, this is much better‎."
tt1981115,"01:00:52,613","01:00:53,614",Ooh‎.
tt1981115,"01:00:53,948","01:00:56,575",The costume is a bit much‎. So tight‎.
tt1981115,"01:00:56,742","01:00:58,035",But the confidence‎.‎.‎.
tt1981115,"01:00:58,202","01:01:00,621",I can feel the righteousness surging‎.
tt1981115,"01:01:00,788","01:01:03,249","Hey‎, do you want to have a rousing discussion about truth‎?"
tt1981115,"01:01:03,708","01:01:04,975",Honor‎? Patriotism‎?
tt1981115,"01:01:05,000","01:01:06,001",God bless Amer‎.‎.‎.
tt1981115,"01:01:08,713","01:01:10,047",What‎?
tt1981115,"01:01:14,552","01:01:16,929",You could at least furnish me with a weapon‎.
tt1981115,"01:01:17,096","01:01:18,973","My dagger‎, something‎."
tt1981115,"01:01:24,478","01:01:25,788",At last‎.
tt1981115,"01:01:25,813","01:01:27,523",A little common sense‎.
tt1981115,"01:01:33,654","01:01:36,257",And I thought you liked tricks‎.
tt1981115,"01:01:36,282","01:01:40,828","Well‎, what then‎? Your lovely mortal is being guarded by a legion of Einherjar"
tt1981115,"01:01:40,995","01:01:42,805",who will see you coming from Miles away‎.
tt1981115,"01:01:42,830","01:01:44,540",I won't be the one who comes for her‎.
tt1981115,"01:01:52,339","01:01:53,340",I'm not hungry‎.
tt1981115,"01:01:54,133","01:01:58,220",What the‎.‎.‎. Good‎. Let's go‎.
tt1981115,"01:02:03,601","01:02:04,643",You're‎.‎.‎.
tt1981115,"01:02:04,810","01:02:06,829","I'm Loki‎, you may have heard of me‎."
tt1981115,"01:02:06,854","01:02:09,457",That was for New York‎.
tt1981115,"01:02:09,482","01:02:10,858",I like her‎.
tt1981115,"01:02:10,983","01:02:12,651",And what of the Allfather‎?
tt1981115,"01:02:13,319","01:02:17,031",It is my sworn duty to notify him of crimes against the throne‎.
tt1981115,"01:02:17,156","01:02:20,785",You called me here on an urgent matter‎.
tt1981115,"01:02:21,827","01:02:22,828",What is it‎?
tt1981115,"01:02:23,287","01:02:24,638","Treason‎, my lord‎."
tt1981115,"01:02:24,663","01:02:25,998",Whose'‎?
tt1981115,"01:02:26,707","01:02:27,750",Mine‎.
tt1981115,"01:02:28,501","01:02:30,060",My king‎!
tt1981115,"01:02:30,085","01:02:32,087",The mortal has been taken‎.
tt1981115,"01:02:35,966","01:02:37,026",Stop Thor‎.
tt1981115,"01:02:37,051","01:02:39,178",By any means necessary‎.
tt1981115,"01:02:41,889","01:02:44,391",There they are‎! Take them‎.
tt1981115,"01:02:44,517","01:02:45,534",On my command‎.
tt1981115,"01:02:45,559","01:02:47,770",I'll hold them off‎. Take her‎.
tt1981115,"01:02:48,395","01:02:49,814",Thank you‎.
tt1981115,"01:02:52,525","01:02:54,777","Betray him‎, and I'll kill you‎."
tt1981115,"01:02:57,029","01:02:59,615","It's good to see you‎, too‎, Sif‎."
tt1981115,"01:03:05,204","01:03:09,542",Assuming you can get Loki's help and you can free this mortal
tt1981115,"01:03:09,667","01:03:11,227",what good would it do‎?
tt1981115,"01:03:11,252","01:03:14,188",We'd all be dead the minute we step one foot outside the palace‎.
tt1981115,"01:03:14,213","01:03:17,424","That‎, my friend‎, is why we won't be leaving by foot‎."
tt1981115,"01:03:21,554","01:03:23,364",I will give you as much time as I can‎.
tt1981115,"01:03:23,389","01:03:25,224","Thank you‎, my friend‎."
tt1981115,"01:03:29,395","01:03:32,565",If you even think about betraying him‎.‎.‎.
tt1981115,"01:03:32,690","01:03:34,375",You'll kill me‎?
tt1981115,"01:03:34,400","01:03:36,402","Evidently‎, there will be a line‎."
tt1981115,"01:03:51,709","01:03:53,794",I thought you said you knew how to fly this thing‎.
tt1981115,"01:03:53,961","01:03:55,754","I said‎, ""How hard could it be‎?"""
tt1981115,"01:03:59,133","01:04:00,134",They're on the ship‎!
tt1981115,"01:04:00,968","01:04:02,261",Get to the ship‎!
tt1981115,"01:04:05,973","01:04:08,617","Well‎, whatever you're doing‎, brother‎, I suggest you do it faster‎."
tt1981115,"01:04:08,642","01:04:11,020","‎- Shut up‎, Loki‎."
tt1981115,"01:04:12,132","01:04:13,372",You must have missed something‎.
tt1981115,"01:04:13,397","01:04:16,166","No‎, I didn't‎. I'm pressing every button on this thing‎."
tt1981115,"01:04:16,191","01:04:17,776","No‎, don't hit it‎. Just press it gently‎."
tt1981115,"01:04:17,902","01:04:19,737","I'm pressing it gently‎, it's networking‎!"
tt1981115,"01:04:22,865","01:04:23,866","Ha‎, ha‎!"
tt1981115,"01:04:27,494","01:04:29,079",Get him‎! Get him‎!
tt1981115,"01:04:57,650","01:05:00,152",‎- I think you missed a column‎. ‎- Shut up‎!
tt1981115,"01:05:07,279","01:05:08,719","Look‎, why don't you let me take over‎?"
tt1981115,"01:05:08,744","01:05:09,995",I'm clearly the better pilot‎.
tt1981115,"01:05:10,287","01:05:12,206","Is that right‎? Well‎, out of the two of us‎,"
tt1981115,"01:05:12,331","01:05:13,832",which one can actually fly‎?
tt1981115,"01:05:24,343","01:05:25,986","Oh‎, dear‎. Is she dead‎?"
tt1981115,"01:05:26,011","01:05:27,012",Jane‎.
tt1981115,"01:05:27,805","01:05:28,806",I'm okay‎.
tt1981115,"01:05:30,766","01:05:31,934",Ah‎!
tt1981115,"01:05:35,938","01:05:37,272",Not a word‎.
tt1981115,"01:05:39,400","01:05:40,776",Now they're following us‎.
tt1981115,"01:05:46,156","01:05:47,282",Now they're firing at us‎.
tt1981115,"01:05:47,449","01:05:48,842","Yeah‎, thank you for the commentary‎, Loki‎,"
tt1981115,"01:05:48,867","01:05:50,202",it's not at all distracting‎!
tt1981115,"01:05:54,748","01:05:57,376",Well done‎. You just decapitated your grandfather‎.
tt1981115,"01:06:08,804","01:06:10,139","You know‎, this is wonderful‎."
tt1981115,"01:06:10,264","01:06:12,558",This is a tremendous idea‎.
tt1981115,"01:06:12,725","01:06:15,811","Let's steal the biggest‎, most obvious ship in the universe"
tt1981115,"01:06:15,978","01:06:17,287",and escape in that‎.
tt1981115,"01:06:17,312","01:06:18,539","Flying around the city‎,"
tt1981115,"01:06:18,564","01:06:20,941",smashing into everything in sight so everyone can see us‎.
tt1981115,"01:06:21,066","01:06:22,786","It's brilliant‎, Thor‎! It's truly brilliant‎!"
tt1981115,"01:06:37,374","01:06:38,976",I see your time in the dungeons
tt1981115,"01:06:39,001","01:06:41,587","has made you no less graceful‎, Loki‎."
tt1981115,"01:06:45,799","01:06:47,760",You lied to me‎.
tt1981115,"01:06:49,011","01:06:50,446",I'm impressed‎.
tt1981115,"01:06:50,471","01:06:51,989",I'm glad you're pleased‎.
tt1981115,"01:06:52,014","01:06:53,073","Now‎, do as you promised‎."
tt1981115,"01:06:53,098","01:06:54,933",And take us to your secret pathway‎.
tt1981115,"01:07:18,165","01:07:19,708",‎- Fandral‎. ‎- Right‎.
tt1981115,"01:07:23,420","01:07:24,421",For Asgard‎.
tt1981115,"01:07:30,052","01:07:31,136","Nothing personal‎, boys‎."
tt1981115,"01:07:46,443","01:07:47,878",Loki‎.‎.‎.
tt1981115,"01:07:47,903","01:07:51,298","If it were easy‎, everyone would do it‎."
tt1981115,"01:07:51,323","01:07:53,325",‎- Are you mad‎? ‎- Possibly‎.
tt1981115,"01:08:08,924","01:08:10,509",LON'‎. Ya‎-den‎!
tt1981115,"01:08:16,056","01:08:19,393",We must strike now‎.
tt1981115,"01:08:20,435","01:08:21,436",No‎.
tt1981115,"01:08:23,063","01:08:28,694",Asgard is meaningless‎.
tt1981115,"01:08:32,906","01:08:34,825",The Aether has found its way home‎.
tt1981115,"01:08:50,591","01:08:54,153",What I could do with the power that flows through those veins‎.
tt1981115,"01:08:54,178","01:08:56,847",It would consume you‎.
tt1981115,"01:08:57,806","01:08:59,391",She's holding up all right‎.
tt1981115,"01:09:00,225","01:09:01,351",For now‎.
tt1981115,"01:09:01,894","01:09:04,438",She's strong in ways you'd never even know‎.
tt1981115,"01:09:04,563","01:09:05,956",Say goodbye‎.
tt1981115,"01:09:05,981","01:09:07,774",Not this day‎.
tt1981115,"01:09:07,900","01:09:10,694","This day‎, the next‎, a hundred years‎, it's nothing‎."
tt1981115,"01:09:11,945","01:09:13,488",It's a heartbeat‎.
tt1981115,"01:09:13,906","01:09:15,908",You'll never be ready‎.
tt1981115,"01:09:16,325","01:09:17,885",The only woman whose love you've prized
tt1981115,"01:09:17,910","01:09:19,761",will be snatched from you‎.
tt1981115,"01:09:19,786","01:09:21,079",And will that satisfy you‎?
tt1981115,"01:09:21,205","01:09:22,806",Satisfaction is not in my nature‎.
tt1981115,"01:09:22,831","01:09:25,042",Surrender is not in mine‎.
tt1981115,"01:09:25,834","01:09:27,394",‎- The son of Odin‎.‎.‎. ‎- No‎.
tt1981115,"01:09:27,419","01:09:29,463",Not just of Odin‎.
tt1981115,"01:09:29,588","01:09:31,924",You think you alone were loved of Mother‎?
tt1981115,"01:09:32,090","01:09:34,092","You had her tricks‎, but I had her trust‎."
tt1981115,"01:09:34,218","01:09:35,510",Trust‎?
tt1981115,"01:09:36,428","01:09:37,930",Was that her last expression‎?
tt1981115,"01:09:38,555","01:09:40,766",Trust‎? When you let her die‎?
tt1981115,"01:09:40,891","01:09:43,660",‎- What help were you in your cell‎? ‎- Who put me there‎?
tt1981115,"01:09:43,685","01:09:45,103",Who put me there‎?
tt1981115,"01:09:45,229","01:09:46,230",You know damn well‎!
tt1981115,"01:09:46,939","01:09:48,690",‎- You know damn well who‎!
tt1981115,"01:09:54,947","01:09:57,616",She wouldn't want us to fight‎.
tt1981115,"01:09:58,742","01:10:01,286","Well‎, she wouldn't exactly be shocked‎."
tt1981115,"01:10:05,999","01:10:08,502",I wish I could trust you‎.
tt1981115,"01:10:23,016","01:10:24,977",Trust my rage‎.
tt1981115,"01:10:31,650","01:10:34,528","You'll have to sign for your father's belongings‎, Mr‎. Selvig‎."
tt1981115,"01:10:35,195","01:10:36,363",What‎?
tt1981115,"01:10:36,488","01:10:37,881","Oh‎, yeah‎."
tt1981115,"01:10:37,906","01:10:40,909","My father‎, Dr‎. Erik Selvig‎."
tt1981115,"01:10:42,619","01:10:45,055","One man's leather wallet‎, brown‎."
tt1981115,"01:10:45,080","01:10:47,541","One key ring‎, three keys‎."
tt1981115,"01:10:47,666","01:10:49,584",Prescription medicine‎.‎.‎.
tt1981115,"01:10:50,335","01:10:51,586",Various‎.
tt1981115,"01:10:54,256","01:10:56,008",‎- And‎.‎.‎. ‎- Erik‎.
tt1981115,"01:10:57,592","01:10:59,069",‎- These‎. ‎- Yeah‎.
tt1981115,"01:10:59,094","01:11:00,304",Those‎.
tt1981115,"01:11:00,804","01:11:02,097",Thank goodness‎.
tt1981115,"01:11:03,765","01:11:04,975",Erik‎.
tt1981115,"01:11:06,768","01:11:07,894",Yes‎?
tt1981115,"01:11:08,020","01:11:09,688","It's‎, uh‎, Darcy‎."
tt1981115,"01:11:09,813","01:11:10,897",Darcy‎.
tt1981115,"01:11:13,108","01:11:14,901",So good to see you‎.
tt1981115,"01:11:15,027","01:11:16,069","Oh‎, I missed you‎, too‎."
tt1981115,"01:11:16,194","01:11:17,671",How did you find me‎?
tt1981115,"01:11:17,696","01:11:18,947",You were naked on TV‎.
tt1981115,"01:11:20,324","01:11:22,451","Okay‎, time to go‎, lots to do‎."
tt1981115,"01:11:24,536","01:11:26,538",Getting weird now‎.
tt1981115,"01:11:27,956","01:11:30,083",I should not be left in charge of stuff like this‎.
tt1981115,"01:11:30,208","01:11:34,104","I don't get paid enough‎. I don't get paid‎, period‎."
tt1981115,"01:11:34,129","01:11:37,132","I'm Ian by the way‎, uh‎, Darcy's intern‎."
tt1981115,"01:11:37,299","01:11:39,468","Yeah‎, I don't get paid either‎."
tt1981115,"01:11:40,344","01:11:41,803",Are you all right‎?
tt1981115,"01:11:41,970","01:11:43,805",I've had a God in my brain‎.
tt1981115,"01:11:45,140","01:11:46,600",‎- I don't recommend it‎.
tt1981115,"01:11:48,226","01:11:50,579","Dr‎. Selvig‎, sir‎, your gear is beeping at me‎."
tt1981115,"01:11:50,604","01:11:52,981",It's happening‎. It's sooner than I calculated‎.
tt1981115,"01:11:53,148","01:11:54,775",Wait‎. What's happening‎?
tt1981115,"01:11:58,070","01:11:59,738",Birds‎?
tt1981115,"01:11:59,863","01:12:01,298",Birds are happening‎?
tt1981115,"01:12:01,323","01:12:03,575",They're starlings‎. It's called a murmuration‎.
tt1981115,"01:12:03,742","01:12:05,911","My dad‎, he used to take me bird watching as a kid‎."
tt1981115,"01:12:06,078","01:12:07,579",‎- Nerd‎. ‎- Look‎!
tt1981115,"01:12:12,167","01:12:14,336",Where did they go‎?
tt1981115,"01:12:27,140","01:12:29,434",What the hell was that‎?
tt1981115,"01:12:29,935","01:12:31,603",Why are you smiling‎?
tt1981115,"01:12:31,770","01:12:33,038",There's nothing more reassuring
tt1981115,"01:12:33,063","01:12:36,833",than realizing that the world is crazier than you are‎.
tt1981115,"01:12:36,858","01:12:39,736",Take me to Jane's lab‎.
tt1981115,"01:12:52,207","01:12:53,667",Jane‎.
tt1981115,"01:13:00,298","01:13:01,633",Malekith‎.
tt1981115,"01:13:23,905","01:13:25,824",All right‎. Are you ready‎?
tt1981115,"01:13:25,991","01:13:27,242",I am‎.
tt1981115,"01:13:40,822","01:13:42,983","You know‎, this plan of yours is going to get us killed‎."
tt1981115,"01:13:43,008","01:13:44,885","Yes‎, possibly‎."
tt1981115,"01:13:48,513","01:13:49,874","You still don't trust me‎, brother‎?"
tt1981115,"01:13:51,349","01:13:52,642",Would you‎?
tt1981115,"01:14:01,568","01:14:02,777","No‎, I wouldn't‎."
tt1981115,"01:14:07,574","01:14:09,034",Thor‎!
tt1981115,"01:14:09,868","01:14:11,453",No‎!
tt1981115,"01:14:20,754","01:14:23,273",You really think I cared about Frigga‎?
tt1981115,"01:14:23,298","01:14:25,008",About any of you‎?
tt1981115,"01:14:28,011","01:14:29,012",All I ever wanted
tt1981115,"01:14:30,514","01:14:32,766",was you and Odin dead at my feet‎!
tt1981115,"01:14:45,403","01:14:46,404",Malekith‎!
tt1981115,"01:14:48,490","01:14:50,492","I am Loki of Jotunheim‎,"
tt1981115,"01:14:50,659","01:14:52,577",‎- and I bring you a gift‎.
tt1981115,"01:14:54,538","01:14:56,431",I ask only one thing in return‎.‎.‎.
tt1981115,"01:14:56,456","01:14:58,308",A good seat from which
tt1981115,"01:14:58,333","01:14:59,876",‎- to watch Asgard burn‎.
tt1981115,"01:15:00,502","01:15:02,812",He is an enemy of Asgard‎.
tt1981115,"01:15:02,837","01:15:05,590",He was a prisoner in their dungeons‎.
tt1981115,"01:15:19,813","01:15:20,939",Look at me‎.
tt1981115,"01:16:18,955","01:16:20,457",Loki‎! NOW‎!
tt1981115,"01:17:40,870","01:17:42,080",Ah‎!
tt1981115,"01:18:36,301","01:18:37,302",Ah‎!
tt1981115,"01:19:34,692","01:19:36,903",‎- Ah‎! ‎- No‎!
tt1981115,"01:19:46,162","01:19:48,289","See you in hell‎, monster‎."
tt1981115,"01:20:07,141","01:20:08,601","No‎. No‎, no‎, no‎."
tt1981115,"01:20:10,937","01:20:13,248","Oh‎, you fool‎, you didn't listen‎."
tt1981115,"01:20:13,273","01:20:14,274",I know‎.‎.‎.
tt1981115,"01:20:15,316","01:20:17,544","I'm a fool‎, I'm a fool‎."
tt1981115,"01:20:17,569","01:20:18,795","Stay with me‎, okay‎?"
tt1981115,"01:20:18,820","01:20:19,988",I'm sorry‎.
tt1981115,"01:20:22,031","01:20:24,242",‎- I'm sorry‎. I'm sorry‎. ‎- Shh‎.‎.‎.
tt1981115,"01:20:24,367","01:20:25,660",It's okay‎.
tt1981115,"01:20:29,289","01:20:30,790",It's all right‎.
tt1981115,"01:20:30,915","01:20:34,419",I'll tell Father what you did here today‎.
tt1981115,"01:20:37,505","01:20:40,425",I didn't do it for him‎.
tt1981115,"01:20:48,975","01:20:51,352",No‎!
tt1981115,"01:21:45,156","01:21:47,200",He's going to unleash it‎.
tt1981115,"01:21:47,325","01:21:52,497","Not just on Asgard‎, or on a star‎. Malekith is going to destroy everything‎."
tt1981115,"01:21:52,622","01:21:53,748",How‎?
tt1981115,"01:21:54,832","01:21:56,000","Jane‎, how‎?"
tt1981115,"01:21:56,125","01:21:59,337",I saw him on Earth‎. Why would he go to Earth‎?
tt1981115,"01:21:59,921","01:22:01,297",The Convergence‎.
tt1981115,"01:22:01,464","01:22:02,690","Oh‎, God‎."
tt1981115,"01:22:02,715","01:22:05,155",None of this would have happened if I hadn't found the Aether‎.
tt1981115,"01:22:05,927","01:22:07,679",Then Malekith would've only possessed it
tt1981115,"01:22:07,804","01:22:09,530",that much sooner‎.
tt1981115,"01:22:09,555","01:22:12,016",I only found it because I was looking for you‎.
tt1981115,"01:22:12,642","01:22:13,893",Jane‎.
tt1981115,"01:22:15,520","01:22:17,230",Now we're trapped here‎.
tt1981115,"01:22:23,778","01:22:24,988",It's not me‎.
tt1981115,"01:22:26,280","01:22:27,490",Hello‎?
tt1981115,"01:22:27,615","01:22:28,825","Hi‎, Jane‎, it's Richard‎."
tt1981115,"01:22:28,992","01:22:30,743",Richard‎? Where are you‎?
tt1981115,"01:22:30,868","01:22:32,078",I'm still at the office‎.
tt1981115,"01:22:32,203","01:22:34,222",It's been a crazy day here today‎.
tt1981115,"01:22:34,247","01:22:36,165","‎- Oh‎, my God‎, this is amazing‎. ‎- Is it‎?"
tt1981115,"01:22:36,290","01:22:37,558",I quite enjoyed our lunch
tt1981115,"01:22:37,583","01:22:39,727",despite never actually ordering anything‎.
tt1981115,"01:22:39,752","01:22:41,229",How am I getting service here‎?
tt1981115,"01:22:41,254","01:22:43,381",Is this a bad time‎? Do you want me to try you later‎?
tt1981115,"01:22:43,506","01:22:46,676","No‎, no‎, no‎. Please‎, whatever you do‎, do not hang up the phone‎."
tt1981115,"01:22:47,552","01:22:48,736","Okay‎, then‎."
tt1981115,"01:22:48,761","01:22:51,197",I was just wondering if you want to try again‎.
tt1981115,"01:22:51,222","01:22:52,740","Uh‎, maybe dinner next time‎."
tt1981115,"01:22:52,765","01:22:54,392","Uh‎, yeah‎, yeah‎, yeah‎."
tt1981115,"01:22:54,517","01:22:56,769","‎- Just stay on the phone‎, okay‎? ‎- Yeah‎, I will‎."
tt1981115,"01:22:56,894","01:22:58,855","On‎, my God‎."
tt1981115,"01:23:02,734","01:23:03,876",Am I interrupting something‎?
tt1981115,"01:23:03,901","01:23:05,611","No‎, no‎, no‎. Nothing at all‎."
tt1981115,"01:23:05,778","01:23:06,838",Come on‎.
tt1981115,"01:23:06,863","01:23:07,947",I'm losing you there‎. Are you in a tunnel‎?
tt1981115,"01:23:08,114","01:23:09,590",Where are we going‎?
tt1981115,"01:23:09,615","01:23:10,616",Hello‎?
tt1981115,"01:23:10,742","01:23:12,577",Why are there so many shoes in here‎?
tt1981115,"01:23:14,162","01:23:15,997",I'll just text her‎.
tt1981115,"01:23:28,301","01:23:29,469","So‎, who's Richard‎?"
tt1981115,"01:23:29,635","01:23:31,095",Really‎?
tt1981115,"01:23:39,437","01:23:40,955",‎- Jane‎! ‎- Hey‎.
tt1981115,"01:23:40,980","01:23:42,790",You can't just leave like that‎.
tt1981115,"01:23:42,815","01:23:44,108",The whole world is going crazy‎.
tt1981115,"01:23:44,275","01:23:46,110",All the stuff we saw is spreading‎.
tt1981115,"01:23:47,612","01:23:49,447",‎- Did you go to a party‎? ‎- Erik‎?
tt1981115,"01:23:49,572","01:23:53,242",Jane‎! How wonderful‎.
tt1981115,"01:23:54,118","01:23:55,161",Oh‎!
tt1981115,"01:23:55,453","01:23:57,388",‎- You've been to Asgard‎. ‎- Where are your pants‎?
tt1981115,"01:23:57,413","01:23:59,165","Oh‎, he‎, uh‎.‎.‎. He says it helps him think‎."
tt1981115,"01:23:59,290","01:24:00,933","Okay‎, well‎, I'm going to need everything you got on this‎."
tt1981115,"01:24:00,958","01:24:03,669","All the work you've been doing on gravimetric anomalies‎, everything‎."
tt1981115,"01:24:03,795","01:24:05,021",Okay‎.
tt1981115,"01:24:05,046","01:24:07,131","‎- Are you well‎, Erik‎?"
tt1981115,"01:24:07,590","01:24:09,092","Your brother's not coming‎, is he‎?"
tt1981115,"01:24:10,093","01:24:11,486",Loki is dead‎.
tt1981115,"01:24:11,511","01:24:12,595","Oh‎, thank God‎!"
tt1981115,"01:24:13,763","01:24:15,973","I‎.‎.‎. I meant‎, I'm so sorry‎."
tt1981115,"01:24:16,099","01:24:17,642",Thank you‎.
tt1981115,"01:24:41,249","01:24:43,126","Forgive me‎, my liege‎."
tt1981115,"01:24:43,960","01:24:46,462",I've returned from the Dark World with news‎.
tt1981115,"01:24:48,923","01:24:50,007",Thor‎?
tt1981115,"01:24:50,675","01:24:55,096","There was no sign of Thor‎, or the weapon‎, but‎.‎.‎."
tt1981115,"01:24:56,931","01:24:58,141",What‎?
tt1981115,"01:25:01,102","01:25:02,728",We found a body‎.
tt1981115,"01:25:07,441","01:25:08,568",Loki‎.
tt1981115,"01:25:12,655","01:25:14,490",Malekith is going to fire the Aether at a spot
tt1981115,"01:25:14,657","01:25:16,576",where all the nine worlds are connecting‎.
tt1981115,"01:25:16,701","01:25:19,220",Amplifying the weapon's impact‎.
tt1981115,"01:25:19,245","01:25:20,663","For each additional world‎,"
tt1981115,"01:25:20,788","01:25:22,874",the power will increase exponentially‎.
tt1981115,"01:25:23,166","01:25:26,043",The effect would be universal‎.
tt1981115,"01:25:26,169","01:25:27,854",But the Alignment is only temporary‎.
tt1981115,"01:25:27,879","01:25:30,923",He must be in exactly the right place at the right time‎.
tt1981115,"01:25:31,048","01:25:32,717","Well‎, how do we know where that is‎?"
tt1981115,"01:25:33,926","01:25:36,345",We follow the directions‎.
tt1981115,"01:25:36,512","01:25:37,763",This has happened before
tt1981115,"01:25:37,889","01:25:41,225","thousands of years ago‎, and the Ancients were there to see it‎."
tt1981115,"01:25:41,893","01:25:43,269","All the great constructions‎,"
tt1981115,"01:25:44,103","01:25:46,873","the Mayans‎, the Chinese‎, the Egyptians‎."
tt1981115,"01:25:46,898","01:25:50,376",They made use of the gravitational effects of the Convergence‎.
tt1981115,"01:25:50,401","01:25:52,545",And they left us a map‎.
tt1981115,"01:25:52,570","01:25:53,988","Stonehenge‎,"
tt1981115,"01:25:55,448","01:25:57,800","Snow‎-don‎, the Great Orme‎."
tt1981115,"01:25:57,825","01:25:59,702",These are all coordinates taking us‎.‎.‎.
tt1981115,"01:26:01,078","01:26:02,079",Here‎.
tt1981115,"01:26:04,582","01:26:06,100",Greenwich‎?
tt1981115,"01:26:06,125","01:26:08,753",The walls between worlds will be almost non‎-existent‎.
tt1981115,"01:26:08,920","01:26:10,271",Physics is going to go ballistic‎.
tt1981115,"01:26:10,296","01:26:12,131","Increases and decreases in gravity‎,"
tt1981115,"01:26:12,256","01:26:13,774",spatial extrusions‎.
tt1981115,"01:26:13,799","01:26:16,427",The very fabric of reality is going to be torn apart‎.
tt1981115,"01:26:19,680","01:26:21,933",I better get my pants‎.
tt1981115,"01:26:23,517","01:26:24,852",Focus‎! This is important‎.
tt1981115,"01:26:25,019","01:26:26,479",We have to hammer them in all around the site
tt1981115,"01:26:26,604","01:26:28,898",and then Jane and Erik will activate them from the tower‎.
tt1981115,"01:26:29,232","01:26:30,691",They're taped together‎.
tt1981115,"01:26:30,900","01:26:33,194",Do you even know what these things do‎?
tt1981115,"01:26:33,569","01:26:35,196",Uh‎.‎.‎. No‎.
tt1981115,"01:26:35,529","01:26:36,530",Neither do I‎.
tt1981115,"01:26:41,535","01:26:42,620",Shh‎!
tt1981115,"01:26:45,331","01:26:47,333","‎- Come on‎, come on‎, come on‎! ‎- Right‎."
tt1981115,"01:27:00,137","01:27:02,265",Holy‎.‎.‎. Shit‎.
tt1981115,"01:27:14,777","01:27:15,778",Ah‎!
tt1981115,"01:28:20,801","01:28:23,095","You needn't have come so far‎, Asgardian‎."
tt1981115,"01:28:23,220","01:28:25,431",Death would've come to you soon enough‎.
tt1981115,"01:28:25,556","01:28:27,116",Not by your hand‎.
tt1981115,"01:28:27,141","01:28:29,952",Your universe was never meant to be‎.
tt1981115,"01:28:29,977","01:28:33,122",Your world and your family
tt1981115,"01:28:33,147","01:28:35,274",will be extinguished‎!
tt1981115,"01:28:37,485","01:28:38,903",We're running out of time‎.
tt1981115,"01:28:39,028","01:28:41,422",‎- Almost there‎. ‎- Are you sure this is going to work‎?
tt1981115,"01:28:41,447","01:28:44,033","These devices were made to detect anomalies‎, not cause them‎."
tt1981115,"01:28:45,076","01:28:46,160","Oh‎, come on‎."
tt1981115,"01:28:51,415","01:28:53,542","Come on‎, Darcy‎."
tt1981115,"01:29:03,969","01:29:05,930","You know‎, with all that power‎,"
tt1981115,"01:29:06,055","01:29:07,556",I thought you'd hit harder‎.
tt1981115,"01:29:32,957","01:29:34,041",Done‎.
tt1981115,"01:29:40,965","01:29:43,676",The Convergence will be in full effect in seven minutes‎.
tt1981115,"01:29:43,801","01:29:46,002",That just means we have to keep Malekith busy for eight‎.
tt1981115,"01:29:52,476","01:29:54,353","Okay‎, you might want to hold on to something‎."
tt1981115,"01:30:00,025","01:30:01,460",That is awesome‎!
tt1981115,"01:30:01,485","01:30:03,045",How did you do that‎?
tt1981115,"01:30:03,070","01:30:04,422","Well‎, the gravitational fields"
tt1981115,"01:30:04,447","01:30:06,799","interact with the weak spots between worlds‎, creating‎.‎.‎."
tt1981115,"01:30:06,824","01:30:08,242","Ooh‎, get the guy with the sword‎!"
tt1981115,"01:30:11,662","01:30:13,539",‎- Oops‎. ‎- Let's go‎.
tt1981115,"01:30:13,664","01:30:15,082",Um‎.‎.‎.
tt1981115,"01:30:15,499","01:30:17,168",‎- What the hell just happened‎?
tt1981115,"01:30:17,334","01:30:18,961",Move‎!
tt1981115,"01:30:36,770","01:30:38,063",What are you all doing‎?
tt1981115,"01:30:38,189","01:30:39,857","You need to get out of here‎, now‎!"
tt1981115,"01:30:39,982","01:30:41,525","You're joking‎, right‎?"
tt1981115,"01:30:41,650","01:30:42,668",That's Thor out there‎.
tt1981115,"01:30:42,693","01:30:44,820",He's waving his hammer around and everything‎!
tt1981115,"01:31:43,629","01:31:45,130",Ah‎!
tt1981115,"01:32:03,190","01:32:04,692",Confirming ship is hostile‎.
tt1981115,"01:32:04,858","01:32:06,794","Confirmed‎, ship is hostile‎."
tt1981115,"01:32:06,819","01:32:08,295",You have permission to engage‎.
tt1981115,"01:32:08,320","01:32:09,588",Roger‎.
tt1981115,"01:32:09,613","01:32:10,739",Missiles locked‎.
tt1981115,"01:32:11,574","01:32:13,325",Missiles away‎.
tt1981115,"01:32:14,785","01:32:16,011",Missiles off target‎.
tt1981115,"01:32:16,036","01:32:18,806","I repeat‎, target missed‎. I'm losing control‎."
tt1981115,"01:32:18,831","01:32:21,625",Mayday‎! Mayday‎! Lost positive control‎.
tt1981115,"01:32:23,752","01:32:24,812",What are you doing‎?
tt1981115,"01:32:24,837","01:32:26,338",My signal's not connecting‎.
tt1981115,"01:32:28,632","01:32:29,692",Jane‎!
tt1981115,"01:32:29,717","01:32:30,801",Come on‎.
tt1981115,"01:33:13,093","01:33:14,386",Are you all right‎?
tt1981115,"01:33:14,553","01:33:15,554",You saved my life‎.
tt1981115,"01:33:19,183","01:33:20,242",Yeah‎.
tt1981115,"01:33:20,267","01:33:21,560",I guess I did‎.
tt1981115,"01:33:29,360","01:33:30,361",Mmm‎.

tt1981115,"01:33:40,829","01:33:42,706",Mind the gap‎.
tt1981115,"01:33:44,958","01:33:45,998",How do I get to Greenwich‎?
tt1981115,"01:33:47,044","01:33:49,046",Take this train‎. Three stops‎.
tt1981115,"01:33:51,131","01:33:53,634",Mind the gap‎.
tt1981115,"01:33:55,552","01:33:57,513",Sorry‎. Sorry‎.
tt1981115,"01:34:35,008","01:34:36,677",‎- We're out of time‎. ‎- Jane‎.

tt1981115,"01:35:07,291","01:35:08,333",We're too late‎.
tt1981115,"01:35:09,710","01:35:11,795",The Convergence is at its peak‎.
tt1981115,"01:35:12,671","01:35:13,797",Can those things stop him‎?
tt1981115,"01:35:13,922","01:35:15,007",Not from here‎.
tt1981115,"01:35:15,174","01:35:17,968",We can't get close enough‎.
tt1981115,"01:35:19,011","01:35:20,262",I can‎.
tt1981115,"01:35:45,579","01:35:46,580",Malekith‎!
tt1981115,"01:35:53,962","01:35:57,216","Darkness returns‎, Asgardian‎."
tt1981115,"01:35:57,341","01:36:00,694",Have you come to witness the end of your universe‎?
tt1981115,"01:36:00,719","01:36:02,763",I've come to accept your surrender‎.
tt1981115,"01:36:22,324","01:36:24,409",You think you can stop this‎?
tt1981115,"01:36:25,118","01:36:27,913",The Aether cannot be destroyed‎.
tt1981115,"01:36:28,038","01:36:29,706",But you can‎.
tt1981115,"01:37:15,252","01:37:17,254",Thor‎! No‎.
tt1981115,"01:37:27,598","01:37:28,640",Jane‎!
tt1981115,"01:37:50,203","01:37:51,204",Ah‎!
tt1981115,"01:37:59,338","01:38:00,923",Everybody okay‎?
tt1981115,"01:38:45,509","01:38:47,427",He's gonna come back‎.
tt1981115,"01:38:49,930","01:38:51,807","Except‎, you know‎,"
tt1981115,"01:38:51,932","01:38:54,159","last time he was gone for‎, like‎, two years‎."
tt1981115,"01:38:54,184","01:38:56,103","Well‎, it's only been two days‎, so‎.‎.‎."
tt1981115,"01:38:58,021","01:38:59,856",Did he say anything before he left‎?
tt1981115,"01:38:59,982","01:39:02,209","Yeah‎, he had to figure some stuff out with his father‎."
tt1981115,"01:39:02,234","01:39:06,363",He kinda committed treason‎.‎.‎. On our way out‎.
tt1981115,"01:39:11,201","01:39:12,244",Oh‎.
tt1981115,"01:39:14,871","01:39:19,543",You once said there would never be a wiser king than me‎.
tt1981115,"01:39:19,710","01:39:20,711",You were wrong‎.
tt1981115,"01:39:21,294","01:39:25,232",The Alignment has brought all the realms together‎.
tt1981115,"01:39:25,257","01:39:28,385",Every one of them saw you offer your life to save them‎.
tt1981115,"01:39:29,052","01:39:33,473",What can Asgard offer its new king in return‎?
tt1981115,"01:39:34,641","01:39:36,518",My life‎.
tt1981115,"01:39:37,644","01:39:40,414","Father‎, I cannot be king of Asgard‎."
tt1981115,"01:39:40,439","01:39:45,235","I will protect Asgard and all the realms with my last and every breath‎,"
tt1981115,"01:39:45,360","01:39:47,612",but I cannot do so from that chair‎.
tt1981115,"01:39:47,738","01:39:51,867","Loki‎, for all his grave imbalance‎, understood rule as I know I never will‎."
tt1981115,"01:39:52,868","01:39:55,537","The brutality‎, the sacrifice‎.‎.‎."
tt1981115,"01:39:55,704","01:39:57,222",It changes you‎.
tt1981115,"01:39:57,247","01:40:00,667",I'd rather be a good man than a great king‎.
tt1981115,"01:40:01,251","01:40:06,106","Is this my son I hear‎, or the woman he loves‎?"
tt1981115,"01:40:06,131","01:40:08,675","When you speak‎, do I never hear Mother's voice‎?"
tt1981115,"01:40:10,677","01:40:13,280","This is not for Jane‎, Father‎."
tt1981115,"01:40:13,305","01:40:15,782",She does not know what I came here to say‎.
tt1981115,"01:40:15,807","01:40:19,144","Now‎, forbid me to see her‎, or say she can rule at my side‎."
tt1981115,"01:40:19,269","01:40:20,604",It changes nothing‎.
tt1981115,"01:40:21,188","01:40:24,524","One son who wanted the throne too much‎,"
tt1981115,"01:40:25,442","01:40:27,569",another who will not take it‎.
tt1981115,"01:40:28,111","01:40:29,863",Is this my legacy‎?
tt1981115,"01:40:30,030","01:40:31,615",Loki died with honor‎.
tt1981115,"01:40:32,574","01:40:34,009",I shall try to live the same‎.
tt1981115,"01:40:34,034","01:40:35,452",Is that not legacy enough‎?
tt1981115,"01:40:46,463","01:40:48,799",It belongs to you‎.
tt1981115,"01:40:49,549","01:40:51,359",If you are worthy of it‎.
tt1981115,"01:40:51,384","01:40:53,887",I shall try to be‎.
tt1981115,"01:40:55,305","01:41:00,018","I cannot give you my blessing‎, nor can I wish you good fortune‎."
tt1981115,"01:41:00,977","01:41:02,646",I know‎.
tt1981115,"01:41:05,482","01:41:08,819","If I were proud of the man my son had become‎,"
tt1981115,"01:41:09,319","01:41:11,655","even that‎, I could not say‎."
tt1981115,"01:41:14,157","01:41:17,786",It would speak only from my heart‎.
tt1981115,"01:41:19,162","01:41:20,580","Go‎,"
tt1981115,"01:41:21,665","01:41:23,166",my son‎.
tt1981115,"01:41:25,293","01:41:26,545","Thank you‎, Father‎."
tt1981115,"01:41:42,144","01:41:43,186",No‎.
tt1981115,"01:41:44,521","01:41:46,189",Thank you‎.
tt1981115,"01:44:04,202","01:44:06,621","I present to you‎,"
tt1981115,"01:44:07,330","01:44:10,834","Taneleer Tivan‎, the Collector‎."
tt1981115,"01:44:12,335","01:44:13,503",Whoa‎.‎.‎.
tt1981115,"01:44:16,589","01:44:21,136","Asgardians‎, it's an honor‎."
tt1981115,"01:44:24,848","01:44:26,933",You know why we're here‎.
tt1981115,"01:44:30,645","01:44:32,564",Of course‎.
tt1981115,"01:44:33,398","01:44:35,650","But‎, if I may ask‎,"
tt1981115,"01:44:35,817","01:44:39,696",why not keep it secure in your own vault‎?
tt1981115,"01:44:39,821","01:44:42,741",The Tesseract is already on Asgard‎.
tt1981115,"01:44:42,866","01:44:46,411",It is not wise to keep two Infinity Stones so close together‎.
tt1981115,"01:44:47,037","01:44:49,539",That's very wise‎.
tt1981115,"01:44:59,382","01:45:00,759","I can assure you‎,"
tt1981115,"01:45:02,010","01:45:07,223","it will be absolutely safe here‎,"
tt1981115,"01:45:09,434","01:45:11,936",in my collection‎.
tt1981115,"01:45:13,104","01:45:15,523",See that it is‎.

tt2381249,"00:01:22,513","00:01:24,919",The package is on the plane.

tt2381249,"00:01:26,539","00:01:30,442","We're currently formulate a plan B although technically, it's a plan C."
tt2381249,"00:01:30,467","00:01:31,840",This isn't going very well.
tt2381249,"00:01:31,880","00:01:34,165","I am aware of that, Brandt. You're not helping."
tt2381249,"00:01:34,189","00:01:35,299",Where's Ethan?
tt2381249,"00:01:35,324","00:01:36,777",I don't know. We're on radio silence.
tt2381249,"00:01:36,802","00:01:39,548","That plane cannot takeoff, with the package on it."
tt2381249,"00:01:39,573","00:01:41,672",- You understand? - We're working on it.
tt2381249,"00:01:41,704","00:01:43,779",Luther?  What the hell are you doing there?
tt2381249,"00:01:43,804","00:01:45,569",You are supposed to be on an assignment in Malaysia.
tt2381249,"00:01:45,594","00:01:48,621","I'm in Malaysia, I've been here 2 days. Benji needed my help."
tt2381249,"00:01:48,676","00:01:52,160","I didn't need help. I just- I needed assistance, it's a different thing."
tt2381249,"00:01:52,185","00:01:54,504",The package is still on that plane.
tt2381249,"00:01:55,875","00:01:57,663",We understand the package is on the plane.
tt2381249,"00:01:57,688","00:02:00,140",- We're trying to cripple it remotely. - You can do that.
tt2381249,"00:02:00,165","00:02:02,931",We can if the pilot left the satellite uplink switch on.
tt2381249,"00:02:02,956","00:02:05,305",- Which he has. - And how do you access the uplink?
tt2381249,"00:02:05,330","00:02:08,855",- It involves hacking a Russian satellite. - I can't authorise that.
tt2381249,"00:02:08,878","00:02:10,697",Which is why I didn't ask permission.
tt2381249,"00:02:10,722","00:02:13,178",We are under investigation for misconduct.
tt2381249,"00:02:13,203","00:02:16,599",The package is on-board. What do you want me to do?

tt2381249,"00:02:29,136","00:02:30,695",Yeah. I'm aware of that.
tt2381249,"00:02:30,720","00:02:34,233",But I can't do anything until I'm connected to the satellite.
tt2381249,"00:02:34,522","00:02:37,401","Benji, you are connected. - Okay, Great."
tt2381249,"00:02:38,050","00:02:40,804",The package is still on that plane.

tt2381249,"00:03:04,560","00:03:06,472","Benji, can you open the door?"
tt2381249,"00:03:06,497","00:03:09,226",Uh. Can I open the door? Uh. Maybe.
tt2381249,"00:03:09,251","00:03:11,763",Open the door when I tell you.
tt2381249,"00:03:25,760","00:03:27,572",I'm on the plane. Open the door.

tt2381249,"00:03:28,762","00:03:31,506","Not in the plane, I'm on the plane!"
tt2381249,"00:03:31,531","00:03:33,798",Open the door!

tt2381249,"00:07:03,201","00:07:05,036",You're in luck.
tt2381249,"00:07:06,477","00:07:08,804",I've a first pressing.
tt2381249,"00:07:16,875","00:07:19,158",It really is you.
tt2381249,"00:07:21,719","00:07:23,859",I've heard stories.
tt2381249,"00:07:24,091","00:07:26,325",They can't all be true.
tt2381249,"00:07:47,970","00:07:49,752","Good even, Mr. Hunt."
tt2381249,"00:07:49,777","00:07:53,502",The weapons you recovered in Belarus were confirmed to be VX nerve gas.
tt2381249,"00:07:53,527","00:07:56,250",Capable of devastating a major city.
tt2381249,"00:07:56,275","00:07:58,121",The bodies of the air crew were found less than
tt2381249,"00:07:58,146","00:08:01,038",24 hours after they landed in Damascus.
tt2381249,"00:08:01,063","00:08:04,080",They were identified as low level Chechen separatist.
tt2381249,"00:08:04,105","00:08:05,978",With neither the access nor the ability
tt2381249,"00:08:06,003","00:08:09,116",to acquire the weapons they were transporting.
tt2381249,"00:08:09,141","00:08:10,859",This would support your suspicion
tt2381249,"00:08:10,884","00:08:14,110",that a shadow organization is committed to inciting revolution.
tt2381249,"00:08:14,134","00:08:18,319",by enabling acts of terror in nations friendly to Western interests.
tt2381249,"00:08:18,345","00:08:21,322",IMF suspects this to be the same shadow organization
tt2381249,"00:08:21,347","00:08:23,605",you have been tracking for the last year
tt2381249,"00:08:23,630","00:08:25,993",Also known as the Syndicate.
tt2381249,"00:08:26,018","00:08:28,397",IMF would be right.
tt2381249,"00:08:28,422","00:08:30,671","Normally, you and your team would be tasked"
tt2381249,"00:08:30,696","00:08:33,662","with infiltrating and disrupting this terrorist network,"
tt2381249,"00:08:33,687","00:08:37,338",but we have taken steps to ensure that this will not happen.
tt2381249,"00:08:37,363","00:08:40,022","Because, we, are the Syndicate, Mr. Hunt."
tt2381249,"00:08:40,047","00:08:42,734",And now we know who you are.
tt2381249,"00:08:42,759","00:08:45,059","Your mission, should you choose to accept it,"
tt2381249,"00:08:45,084","00:08:46,709",is to face your fate.
tt2381249,"00:08:46,734","00:08:50,891","Pursue us, you'll be caught. Resist us, you'll be killed."
tt2381249,"00:08:50,916","00:08:55,065",And you precious Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions.
tt2381249,"00:08:55,090","00:08:56,409","Good luck, Mr. Hunt."
tt2381249,"00:08:56,434","00:09:00,625",This message will self destruct in 5 seconds.
tt2381249,"00:09:50,248","00:09:55,148","Mr. Chairman, the IMF's misadventures date back to my earliest days in the CIA"
tt2381249,"00:09:55,187","00:09:59,829",when the IMF broke into the CIA to steal a list of covert operatives.
tt2381249,"00:09:59,854","00:10:02,840","- And now, more recently a Russian warhead. - Disarmed Russian warhead."
tt2381249,"00:10:02,865","00:10:05,658",- A Russian nuclear warhead. - Branded safe by Th IMF.
tt2381249,"00:10:05,683","00:10:09,074",Clipped the Transamerica Pyramid before plunging into the San Francisco bay.
tt2381249,"00:10:09,099","00:10:10,613",Saving the western atmosphere.
tt2381249,"00:10:10,638","00:10:13,168",This made possible by IMF agents who did willing
tt2381249,"00:10:13,193","00:10:16,304",provide the launch codes to a known terrorist.
tt2381249,"00:10:16,329","00:10:19,175","Do I have that right, agent Brandt?"
tt2381249,"00:10:19,705","00:10:23,890",I can neither confirm nor deny details of any such operation without Secretary's approval.
tt2381249,"00:10:23,924","00:10:26,836",This was the same week after IMF infiltrated the Kremlin.
tt2381249,"00:10:26,861","00:10:29,327",Here's the Kremlin before.
tt2381249,"00:10:30,184","00:10:32,823",And the Kremlin after.
tt2381249,"00:10:34,698","00:10:37,477",I can neither confirm nor deny details of any operation...
tt2381249,"00:10:37,502","00:10:39,256","Without the Secretary's approval. Yes, we know."
tt2381249,"00:10:39,281","00:10:41,779","In fact, until this panel appoints a new Secretary,"
tt2381249,"00:10:41,804","00:10:44,221","you really can't say much of anything, can you, agent Brandt?"
tt2381249,"00:10:44,246","00:10:45,785","Well. I didn't write the rules, Mr. Hunley."
tt2381249,"00:10:45,810","00:10:48,528","Mr. Chairman, the so call Impossible Missions Force"
tt2381249,"00:10:48,568","00:10:52,008","is not just a rogue organization, it is an outdated one."
tt2381249,"00:10:52,034","00:10:55,905",A throwback to an era without transparency and without oversight.
tt2381249,"00:10:55,930","00:10:58,336",- Mr. Chairman. - The time has come to dissolve the IMF.
tt2381249,"00:10:58,361","00:11:02,504",- Mr. Chairman. - And transfer the salvageable assets to the CIA.
tt2381249,"00:11:02,529","00:11:05,827","Mr. Chairman, the IMF has operated without oversight for 40 years."
tt2381249,"00:11:05,852","00:11:08,266","- Now, are its methods unorthodox? Yes. - Mr. Chairman."
tt2381249,"00:11:08,291","00:11:11,451",Are it's results less than perfect? Absolutely.
tt2381249,"00:11:11,490","00:11:14,059","- But without the IMF, to be force... - There'll be order and stability."
tt2381249,"00:11:14,084","00:11:16,247",Without the IMF...
tt2381249,"00:11:17,398","00:11:22,551",This panel recognizes the IMF's contribution to global security.
tt2381249,"00:11:22,576","00:11:25,874",But the events laid out by CIA director Hunley
tt2381249,"00:11:25,903","00:11:28,929",also show a pattern of once and brinkmanship
tt2381249,"00:11:28,954","00:11:31,860",and a total disregard for protocol.
tt2381249,"00:11:31,885","00:11:33,106","From where I sit,"
tt2381249,"00:11:33,131","00:11:37,100",you unorthodox methods are indistinguishable from chance.
tt2381249,"00:11:37,125","00:11:40,204","And your results, perfect or not,"
tt2381249,"00:11:40,229","00:11:42,948",looked suspiciously like luck.
tt2381249,"00:11:43,624","00:11:48,750",I'm afraid today is the day when the IMF's luck runs out.
tt2381249,"00:13:27,681","00:13:29,559",What are you doing here?
tt2381249,"00:13:30,274","00:13:31,619",Huh?
tt2381249,"00:13:34,351","00:13:37,298","I said: ""What are you doing here?"""
tt2381249,"00:13:44,555","00:13:47,694","What does he see in you, I wonder."
tt2381249,"00:13:48,023","00:13:49,657",Who is he?
tt2381249,"00:13:53,320","00:13:56,045",I want to see what is done.
tt2381249,"00:13:57,185","00:13:59,511",Why don't you take off the cuffs.
tt2381249,"00:13:59,536","00:14:01,683",And I'll show you.
tt2381249,"00:14:01,708","00:14:03,481",Vinter.
tt2381249,"00:14:06,862","00:14:08,831",You know who I am?
tt2381249,"00:14:08,856","00:14:10,930",Janik Vinter.
tt2381249,"00:14:11,541","00:14:14,947","They call you, the bone doctor."
tt2381249,"00:14:16,070","00:14:18,139",The funny thing is.
tt2381249,"00:14:18,164","00:14:22,272","You're officially declared dead, 3 years ago."
tt2381249,"00:14:22,297","00:14:24,456",Nice shoes by the way.
tt2381249,"00:14:25,942","00:14:27,795",Not his.
tt2381249,"00:14:28,005","00:14:29,720",Yours.
tt2381249,"00:14:36,156","00:14:38,722","We have instructions to talk,"
tt2381249,"00:14:38,747","00:14:40,193",not to kill him.
tt2381249,"00:14:40,218","00:14:43,342",There are men who are broken in different ways.
tt2381249,"00:14:44,838","00:14:46,862",This one's a fighter.
tt2381249,"00:14:46,887","00:14:49,486","He'll die, before you turn him."
tt2381249,"00:14:49,511","00:14:52,283",Are you worry he's gonna take your place?
tt2381249,"00:15:02,801","00:15:07,285","You should go, before it gets ugly."
tt2381249,"00:15:09,493","00:15:11,929","Yeah, he's right."
tt2381249,"00:15:11,954","00:15:13,975",You should go.
tt2381249,"00:15:27,587","00:15:30,841","Now, let's see how tough you are."
tt2381249,"00:15:32,011","00:15:33,981","You, Janik."
tt2381249,"00:16:56,482","00:16:59,177","We've never met before, right?"
tt2381249,"00:17:00,910","00:17:02,707",Follow me.
tt2381249,"00:17:10,671","00:17:12,434",Give me the gun.
tt2381249,"00:17:15,695","00:17:18,569",- What're you doing? - I can't leave.
tt2381249,"00:17:18,594","00:17:20,662",Look. You can't stay. We just killed those men.
tt2381249,"00:17:20,687","00:17:22,868",We didn't kill them. You did.
tt2381249,"00:17:22,893","00:17:26,476",I tried to stop you. You got away.
tt2381249,"00:17:27,694","00:17:29,611",Who are you?
tt2381249,"00:17:29,636","00:17:32,750",You better hurry now. Good luck.
tt2381249,"00:17:32,775","00:17:34,441","No, wait. Wait!"
tt2381249,"00:17:34,466","00:17:35,596",Where is he?
tt2381249,"00:17:35,621","00:17:38,109",He's heading to the north corridor. He has closed the gate.
tt2381249,"00:17:38,134","00:17:41,304","Hurry, don't let him escape. Quick!"

tt2381249,"00:18:14,909","00:18:18,714",A face. He wanted something. Not information.
tt2381249,"00:18:18,739","00:18:21,819","He could've kill me, but he didn't."
tt2381249,"00:18:21,859","00:18:25,500","- Okay, what do you think it means. - The Syndicate is real."
tt2381249,"00:18:25,588","00:18:28,287","They know who we're, how we operate."
tt2381249,"00:18:28,312","00:18:31,028",I think I know why they've been so hard to find.
tt2381249,"00:18:31,053","00:18:36,188",Just focus operations on gathering any available Intel regarding formal covert operatives.
tt2381249,"00:18:36,213","00:18:38,248",It doesn't matter what country or agency.
tt2381249,"00:18:38,273","00:18:40,713",Just as long as they are dead Or presumed dead.
tt2381249,"00:18:40,738","00:18:45,498",Start with Janik Vinter. He's also known as the bone doctor.
tt2381249,"00:18:45,523","00:18:47,809",- I can't do that. - What?
tt2381249,"00:18:47,834","00:18:49,845",What're you talking about?
tt2381249,"00:18:50,134","00:18:52,086",The Committee has shut us down.
tt2381249,"00:18:52,111","00:18:55,283",Operations are to be handled over to the CIA.
tt2381249,"00:18:55,308","00:18:57,041",There is no more IMF.
tt2381249,"00:18:57,065","00:18:59,839",I've been ordered to bring everyone in.
tt2381249,"00:19:00,851","00:19:02,620",- Ethan. - I understand.
tt2381249,"00:19:02,645","00:19:05,008","- Ethan. - I understand, Brandt."
tt2381249,"00:19:05,033","00:19:06,994",We didn't have this conversation.
tt2381249,"00:19:07,019","00:19:10,155",I disappeared in London. You don't know where I am.
tt2381249,"00:19:10,180","00:19:11,743",If I'm dead or alive.
tt2381249,"00:19:11,768","00:19:14,295",This man you saw. Can you find him?
tt2381249,"00:19:15,489","00:19:18,394",I won't stop until I do.
tt2381249,"00:19:18,768","00:19:21,787","This may very well be our last mission, Ethan."
tt2381249,"00:19:21,812","00:19:23,447",Make it count.
tt2381249,"00:19:23,472","00:19:25,165",Brandt.
tt2381249,"00:19:44,311","00:19:45,687","Since we are going to be work together,"
tt2381249,"00:19:45,712","00:19:48,370",I want you to choose your next works very carefully.
tt2381249,"00:19:48,395","00:19:49,512",Where is Hunt?
tt2381249,"00:19:49,537","00:19:51,462","- I don't know. - Don't lie to me, Brandt."
tt2381249,"00:19:51,487","00:19:53,243",I have no way of contacting him.
tt2381249,"00:19:53,268","00:19:56,073","He's deep cover. Last I heard, he's tracking the Syndicate."
tt2381249,"00:19:56,098","00:19:57,405",Let's cut the bull.
tt2381249,"00:19:57,430","00:20:00,452",You know who we are. You know what we are capable of.
tt2381249,"00:20:00,477","00:20:05,290",How come the CIA has never discovered any actual Intel regarding this Syndicate.
tt2381249,"00:20:05,315","00:20:07,971","- What are you implying? - Not implying, stating."
tt2381249,"00:20:07,996","00:20:10,259",Leveling an accusation actually.
tt2381249,"00:20:10,284","00:20:13,870",Hunt is both arsonist and fireman at the same time.
tt2381249,"00:20:13,895","00:20:16,502",I believe that the Syndicate is a figment of his imagination.
tt2381249,"00:20:16,527","00:20:19,809",Created to justify the IMF's existence.
tt2381249,"00:20:19,834","00:20:22,183","I'm going to find him, Brandt. And when I do,"
tt2381249,"00:20:22,208","00:20:28,600",he will be called upon to answer for every wanton active mayhem he's responsible for.
tt2381249,"00:20:30,221","00:20:32,640",Welcome to the CIA.
tt2381249,"00:20:34,212","00:20:35,611",You'll never find him.
tt2381249,"00:20:35,636","00:20:37,481","Set your watch, Brandt."

tt2381249,"00:23:14,379","00:23:16,322",YOU'VE WON!
tt2381249,"00:23:20,836","00:23:22,363",Dunn.
tt2381249,"00:23:23,445","00:23:26,511",Is it that time already. Okay.
tt2381249,"00:23:27,701","00:23:30,197",I'm going to ask you a series of control questions.
tt2381249,"00:23:30,222","00:23:31,895",I know and I'm gonna answer truthfully.
tt2381249,"00:23:31,920","00:23:34,456",And then you gonna ask me to lie intentionally.
tt2381249,"00:23:34,481","00:23:37,442",- State your name. - The King of Norway.
tt2381249,"00:23:38,069","00:23:39,432","See, that's a lie."
tt2381249,"00:23:39,457","00:23:41,225",I'm actually third in line to the throne.
tt2381249,"00:23:41,250","00:23:42,887",My brother was...
tt2381249,"00:23:42,912","00:23:45,387",- Has Ethan Hunt contacted you? - Why would he contact me?
tt2381249,"00:23:45,412","00:23:48,248",Hunt has resurfaced. This time in Cuba.
tt2381249,"00:23:48,273","00:23:52,229",He... left these behind.
tt2381249,"00:23:52,504","00:23:54,636",Tell me what you make of them.
tt2381249,"00:23:54,938","00:23:56,639",I don't know. He's taken up scrap booking?
tt2381249,"00:23:56,664","00:23:58,542","Look at the photographs, Dunn."
tt2381249,"00:23:58,567","00:24:01,432","All of them are either missing or dead, everyone."
tt2381249,"00:24:01,457","00:24:03,055",All of them were government agents.
tt2381249,"00:24:03,080","00:24:06,096","Russian, French, British, Israelis, you name it."
tt2381249,"00:24:06,121","00:24:09,386",These are highly classified files and yet Hunt had no problem collecting them.
tt2381249,"00:24:09,411","00:24:12,459",And he always seems to be a step ahead of us.
tt2381249,"00:24:12,484","00:24:14,846",- I wonder how? - Are you suggesting I'm helping him?
tt2381249,"00:24:14,871","00:24:17,070",That thought had cross my mind.
tt2381249,"00:24:17,095","00:24:18,792","6 months, I have been here."
tt2381249,"00:24:18,823","00:24:22,846",Sifting through mountains of metadata and exabytes of encoded excrement.
tt2381249,"00:24:22,871","00:24:26,922","I had decrypted, processed, passed more data than anyone in my section."
tt2381249,"00:24:26,947","00:24:28,888","And yet every week, you hold me in here."
tt2381249,"00:24:28,913","00:24:31,866","And you ask me the same question, just in a different way."
tt2381249,"00:24:31,891","00:24:35,414","And today, you haven't answered it."
tt2381249,"00:24:37,148","00:24:41,019",You seem to thinks I have some kind of obligation to him.
tt2381249,"00:24:41,044","00:24:43,639","Okay, nothing could be further from the truth."
tt2381249,"00:24:43,664","00:24:50,376","Ethan Hunt is still out there in the field, and I'm stuck here answering for it"
tt2381249,"00:24:50,478","00:24:52,867",We're not friends.
tt2381249,"00:24:54,543","00:24:56,846",I owe him nothing.
tt2381249,"00:25:01,397","00:25:03,922","That'll be all, Dunn."
tt2381249,"00:26:01,987","00:26:04,495","Welcome to Vienna, Benji. Missed me?"
tt2381249,"00:26:04,520","00:26:06,589","Ethan, where are you? Where the hell have you been?"
tt2381249,"00:26:06,614","00:26:08,778","No act.. you know what? Please, don't tell me that,"
tt2381249,"00:26:08,803","00:26:11,769",because it's just another thing I would have to lie about in my weekly polygraph.
tt2381249,"00:26:11,794","00:26:13,991",Everything is going to be fine. Just keep walking.
tt2381249,"00:26:14,016","00:26:16,355","But, make sure you're not being follow.ed"
tt2381249,"00:26:16,380","00:26:19,594","- Oh. I didn't win those opera tickets, did I? - No, I'm afraid not"
tt2381249,"00:26:19,619","00:26:21,293","- So, where do we meet? - We don't."
tt2381249,"00:26:21,318","00:26:24,167","For your sake, we shouldn't be seen together."
tt2381249,"00:26:24,192","00:26:25,783",You have mail.
tt2381249,"00:26:26,831","00:26:28,743",- Who is he? - That's what we're here to find out.
tt2381249,"00:26:28,799","00:26:31,916","What I do know, is he's our only possible link to the Syndicate"
tt2381249,"00:26:32,518","00:26:34,915",and I have reason to believe that he's going to be here tonight.
tt2381249,"00:26:34,940","00:26:38,131",But I can't find him alone. Are you in?
tt2381249,"00:26:38,156","00:26:41,486","- Are you in? - Yes, of course. Of course."
tt2381249,"00:26:41,511","00:26:44,978","- So, what's the play? - Simple. You find him, we tag him."
tt2381249,"00:26:45,003","00:26:47,902",- I follow him wherever he goes. - And after that?
tt2381249,"00:26:47,927","00:26:50,985","After that you're on a plane, back at work Monday morning."
tt2381249,"00:26:51,010","00:26:54,321",- No one is the wiser. - What? That's it?
tt2381249,"00:26:54,346","00:26:55,916",You're in enough danger as it is.
tt2381249,"00:26:55,941","00:26:58,533",I didn't want to involve you this much but I had no choice.
tt2381249,"00:26:58,558","00:27:00,351","Whoa. If you're gonna bring me all this way,"
tt2381249,"00:27:00,376","00:27:03,951","you could at least give me something a little be more...you know, dramatic."
tt2381249,"00:27:03,976","00:27:06,957","Benji, we are trying to keep a low profile."
tt2381249,"00:27:06,982","00:27:10,640","You want drama, go to the opera."
tt2381249,"00:27:38,287","00:27:42,285","- Are you seeing what I'm seeing? - Yes, I am."
tt2381249,"00:27:48,346","00:27:51,635",Am I correct in assuming that is the Chancellor of Austria?
tt2381249,"00:27:51,660","00:27:55,162","- Yes, you are. - Did you know he's going to be here?"
tt2381249,"00:27:55,187","00:27:56,846",- No - Right.
tt2381249,"00:27:56,871","00:27:59,194","Well. We have a European Heads of State here,"
tt2381249,"00:27:59,219","00:28:02,731",at the same time as we're looking for a nefarious terrorist.
tt2381249,"00:28:02,756","00:28:06,294",- And I'm sure the two things are completely unrelated. - Benji.
tt2381249,"00:28:06,319","00:28:11,244",- Mean while I'll try and overlook the fact that you're an international fugitive wanted by the CIA. - Benji.
tt2381249,"00:28:11,269","00:28:14,828",- And this little unsanctioned operation is tenement-ed treasonous. - Benji.
tt2381249,"00:28:14,853","00:28:16,173","Because as you stated earlier,"
tt2381249,"00:28:16,198","00:28:18,011","I will be back in my desk on Monday morning,"
tt2381249,"00:28:18,036","00:28:20,931",playing video games and no one will be any be the wiser.
tt2381249,"00:28:20,956","00:28:22,682","- The show's about to start, Benji. - Right."
tt2381249,"00:28:22,707","00:28:25,548","- Just take your position, tell me what you see. - Okay."
tt2381249,"00:28:25,573","00:28:27,878","Nice tux, by the way."
tt2381249,"00:28:46,415","00:28:48,781",Stage is set. Ready lights.
tt2381249,"00:28:48,806","00:28:50,990",Ready lights.
tt2381249,"00:28:57,459","00:29:00,216",The final preparations ready.
tt2381249,"00:29:00,241","00:29:02,491","Stay alert, please."
tt2381249,"00:29:36,256","00:29:40,725","Join the IMF. See the world, on a monitor"
tt2381249,"00:29:40,750","00:29:42,551",in a closet.
tt2381249,"00:30:24,146","00:30:26,549","Okay, I have eyes."
tt2381249,"00:30:26,574","00:30:28,335",Searching
tt2381249,"00:31:29,816","00:31:33,399","- Talk to me, Benji. - Nothing yet. Standby."
tt2381249,"00:31:34,543","00:31:39,450",I know you're here. Where're you.
tt2381249,"00:31:44,504","00:31:47,161","Uh Ethan, I might have something for you. Can't confirm."
tt2381249,"00:31:47,186","00:31:50,014","- Where? - Backstage, I will direct you"
tt2381249,"00:31:56,977","00:32:01,337",Take the door on your left. He should be right in front of you.
tt2381249,"00:32:42,089","00:32:45,072","Benji, did you see that? - See what?"
tt2381249,"00:32:45,689","00:32:46,782",A woman.
tt2381249,"00:32:46,807","00:32:48,559",What woman? Where're you?
tt2381249,"00:32:48,584","00:32:50,464",I can't see you.
tt2381249,"00:35:07,905","00:35:11,323",- What happened? - I don't know
tt2381249,"00:35:24,291","00:35:27,191","Ethan, do you copy? Ethan, come in."
tt2381249,"00:37:48,380","00:37:51,721","Ethan, the lighting booth. Ethan, do you copy?"
tt2381249,"00:37:51,746","00:37:53,242",Oh god.
tt2381249,"00:39:18,979","00:39:21,192",It's a flash wound.
tt2381249,"00:39:55,801","00:39:58,234","Sorry, ladies and gentlemen."
tt2381249,"00:40:02,881","00:40:06,517",Surround the building. Secure the exits.
tt2381249,"00:40:08,207","00:40:12,088",I've a way out. Interested?
tt2381249,"00:40:13,133","00:40:14,930",Lead the way.
tt2381249,"00:40:22,835","00:40:26,213","- Anything you want to tell me? - No, not right now."
tt2381249,"00:40:26,238","00:40:29,426",- How's the pace? - Don't wait for me.
tt2381249,"00:40:37,239","00:40:39,164",What's next?
tt2381249,"00:40:40,491","00:40:42,029",Alright.
tt2381249,"00:40:42,525","00:40:43,918",There.
tt2381249,"00:40:51,619","00:40:53,344",Shoes.
tt2381249,"00:40:53,471","00:40:55,605","Shoes, please."
tt2381249,"00:41:51,468","00:41:52,794",If anything happens to you...
tt2381249,"00:41:52,819","00:41:55,645",Nothing is going to happen to me.
tt2381249,"00:41:56,033","00:41:57,955",Stop the car!
tt2381249,"00:42:05,843","00:42:07,527",Get in.
tt2381249,"00:42:09,132","00:42:10,941",Go go go.
tt2381249,"00:42:18,535","00:42:21,211",What the...! She tried to shoot me.
tt2381249,"00:42:21,236","00:42:23,909",It doesn't make her a bad person.
tt2381249,"00:42:24,026","00:42:26,654",- I'm gonna have to search you. - You have to let me go.
tt2381249,"00:42:26,679","00:42:28,198",Oh oh. Not a chance.
tt2381249,"00:42:28,223","00:42:31,858",I assume you're deep cover back in London but isn't this taking the role a little too far.
tt2381249,"00:42:31,883","00:42:33,060","Hang on a minute, you know her?"
tt2381249,"00:42:33,085","00:42:35,187",Oh. We haven't formerly introduced.
tt2381249,"00:42:35,212","00:42:37,605",But I am pretty sure she's British intelligence.
tt2381249,"00:42:37,630","00:42:40,566",Ilsa Faust. You're Ethan Hunt.
tt2381249,"00:42:40,591","00:42:44,558",And... that shade is very hard to find.
tt2381249,"00:42:44,594","00:42:47,741",- What were you doing at the opera tonight? - What? Aside from killing the Chancellor.
tt2381249,"00:42:47,766","00:42:51,923",Saving your life in London put me in a tight spot with some very dangerous people.
tt2381249,"00:42:51,948","00:42:54,418",I was sent to kill the Chancellor to regain their trust.
tt2381249,"00:42:54,443","00:42:56,135","Ha. So, you admit that you killed him?"
tt2381249,"00:42:56,160","00:42:59,301","I went through the motion, that's not the same thing."
tt2381249,"00:42:59,326","00:43:02,367","You thought you put him in the hospital, take him out of harm's way."
tt2381249,"00:43:02,392","00:43:04,081",The same thing you tried to do.
tt2381249,"00:43:04,106","00:43:06,530","You're not gonna believe that, are you? What about the rest of her team?"
tt2381249,"00:43:06,555","00:43:10,407",You means those other 2 idiots? I can only assumed they were redundancies.
tt2381249,"00:43:10,432","00:43:14,472","In case you didn't follow through. One man to kill the Chancellor,"
tt2381249,"00:43:14,540","00:43:17,111",the other one to kill you. A test.
tt2381249,"00:43:17,136","00:43:19,093","Second one I failed, thanks to you."
tt2381249,"00:43:19,141","00:43:22,528",And the car bomb was insurance.
tt2381249,"00:43:26,370","00:43:28,473",We have a tail.
tt2381249,"00:43:29,780","00:43:31,620",Who is he?
tt2381249,"00:43:31,645","00:43:33,802","We're after the same thing, and I can help you."
tt2381249,"00:43:33,827","00:43:36,720","If you want to bring down the Syndicate, you've to let me out."
tt2381249,"00:43:36,745","00:43:38,750",They're closing.
tt2381249,"00:43:39,631","00:43:42,256","This has to look like an escape. So, you just throw me out anywhere."
tt2381249,"00:43:42,281","00:43:44,741",Tell me who he is.
tt2381249,"00:43:44,766","00:43:46,073",Oh!
tt2381249,"00:43:46,856","00:43:49,705",Oh. Change of plan. Throw her out!
tt2381249,"00:43:51,386","00:43:53,993",You have everything you need to find me.
tt2381249,"00:44:09,467","00:44:13,453",Less than 24 hours after we interviewed Benji Dunn about Ethan Hunt
tt2381249,"00:44:13,478","00:44:16,005",He was on a plane to Vienna with tickets to the opera.
tt2381249,"00:44:16,033","00:44:19,305","And within 6 hours of his arrival, the Chancellor was dead."
tt2381249,"00:44:19,330","00:44:21,772","Now, that might be circumstance to some public defendant."
tt2381249,"00:44:21,797","00:44:24,922","But to the CIA, that is actionable intelligence."
tt2381249,"00:44:24,923","00:44:29,433","Consider the moment, the possibility that Ethan's investigation lead him to the opera."
tt2381249,"00:44:29,458","00:44:31,129",And he's the one with the actionable intelligence.
tt2381249,"00:44:31,130","00:44:35,274",In any case. Finding Hunt is no longer our pet project.
tt2381249,"00:44:35,314","00:44:39,568",The Special Activity Division will now have full discretion.
tt2381249,"00:44:40,206","00:44:41,605",You mean shoot to kill?
tt2381249,"00:44:41,630","00:44:46,287",Whether Hunt lives or dies. It's entirely up to him.
tt2381249,"00:45:45,790","00:45:49,195","New identity, passport, cash, road map."
tt2381249,"00:45:49,228","00:45:50,798","There's a change of clothes in that bag, right there."
tt2381249,"00:45:50,823","00:45:53,678",Everything you need to make it to DC undetected.
tt2381249,"00:45:53,703","00:45:56,461","Once you're there, you'll have to inform on me."
tt2381249,"00:45:56,486","00:45:58,323","- I'm suppose... what? Sorry, what? - Tell the truth."
tt2381249,"00:45:58,324","00:46:01,279",You came to Vienna believing you won 2 tickets to the opera.
tt2381249,"00:46:01,304","00:46:04,658","And I attempted to recruit you into assassinating the Chancellor, you refused."
tt2381249,"00:46:04,683","00:46:07,824","- That is not the true. - Your life depends on them believing you, Benji."
tt2381249,"00:46:07,849","00:46:10,261",It'll go easier if you tell them what they want to hear.
tt2381249,"00:46:10,286","00:46:13,924","Ethan, at least tell me what this is all about."
tt2381249,"00:46:22,059","00:46:24,385",You recognized anyone?
tt2381249,"00:46:36,587","00:46:39,945","- Him. - He's former KSA, German intelligence."
tt2381249,"00:46:39,970","00:46:42,127","Missing, presumed dead."
tt2381249,"00:46:42,475","00:46:44,423",He was at the opera tonight.
tt2381249,"00:46:44,448","00:46:45,996",This one too.
tt2381249,"00:46:46,021","00:46:49,461",- Former Mossad. - Let me guess. Presumed dead.
tt2381249,"00:46:49,568","00:46:52,025","Tonight, I made it official."
tt2381249,"00:46:52,938","00:46:55,318",I was looking for him in Bosporus.
tt2381249,"00:46:55,343","00:46:59,378",The same day a car accident killed the visiting President of Malawi.
tt2381249,"00:47:00,051","00:47:02,827",He slipped away again in Jakarta.
tt2381249,"00:47:02,940","00:47:05,970",Hours before a passenger plane vanished over the Pacific
tt2381249,"00:47:05,995","00:47:08,782",with 236 passengers.
tt2381249,"00:47:09,417","00:47:11,364",I just missed him in the Philippines.
tt2381249,"00:47:11,389","00:47:16,487","Right before a fired petrochemical plant gassed a village of 2,000 people."
tt2381249,"00:47:18,261","00:47:21,405",You're saying these accidents are somehow connected.
tt2381249,"00:47:22,300","00:47:26,424",That missing plane was carrying the Secretary of the World Bank.
tt2381249,"00:47:27,340","00:47:30,946",That fire bank corrupted a global arms cooperation.
tt2381249,"00:47:31,553","00:47:34,454",That wreck triggered a civil war.
tt2381249,"00:47:35,793","00:47:38,027",These are no accidents.
tt2381249,"00:47:38,127","00:47:43,457","They're links in a chain. The work of a single organization, the Syndicate."
tt2381249,"00:47:43,597","00:47:44,867",A rogue nation.
tt2381249,"00:47:44,892","00:47:47,996",Trained to do what we do. Inbuilt with a new sense of purpose.
tt2381249,"00:47:48,021","00:47:50,350",Destroy the system that created them.
tt2381249,"00:47:50,375","00:47:52,931",Regardless if who's in the way.
tt2381249,"00:47:53,424","00:47:55,756",An anti-IMF.
tt2381249,"00:47:55,781","00:47:59,453","And since Hunley shut us down, they've been escalating unchecked."
tt2381249,"00:47:59,478","00:48:02,179",Killing the Chancellor tonight was a statement
tt2381249,"00:48:02,203","00:48:04,326",The start of a new phase.
tt2381249,"00:48:04,351","00:48:08,727",Or they could just be a series of random disasters.
tt2381249,"00:48:09,635","00:48:11,924",He was there.
tt2381249,"00:48:12,134","00:48:13,284",Everytime.
tt2381249,"00:48:13,309","00:48:16,421",Just like he was there tonight. I'm sure of it.
tt2381249,"00:48:16,727","00:48:20,098","I don't know who he is, where he's from."
tt2381249,"00:48:20,275","00:48:22,238",How he's funded
tt2381249,"00:48:22,263","00:48:24,374",But I know he's the key.
tt2381249,"00:48:24,399","00:48:26,914","Ethan, this is what I sign up for."
tt2381249,"00:48:26,939","00:48:29,262",- Let me help you find him. - That's why I brought you here.
tt2381249,"00:48:29,287","00:48:31,704",In the first place. And look what happened.
tt2381249,"00:48:31,729","00:48:33,508",I can't protect you.
tt2381249,"00:48:33,533","00:48:35,489",That's why I need you to leave.
tt2381249,"00:48:35,514","00:48:38,744","It's not your decision to make, Ethan."
tt2381249,"00:48:38,769","00:48:40,355",I'm a field agent.
tt2381249,"00:48:40,380","00:48:43,227","I know the risks. More than that, I'm your friend."
tt2381249,"00:48:43,252","00:48:45,169",No matter what I... con a polygraph every week.
tt2381249,"00:48:45,194","00:48:48,250",Now you called me because you needed my help.
tt2381249,"00:48:48,275","00:48:51,482","And you still do. So, I'm staying."
tt2381249,"00:48:51,507","00:48:54,229",And that's all we're gonna say about that.
tt2381249,"00:48:58,171","00:49:01,635",- Okay - Good
tt2381249,"00:49:03,155","00:49:05,139",Where do we start?
tt2381249,"00:49:06,497","00:49:08,145",Ilsa.
tt2381249,"00:49:10,194","00:49:12,838",Right. And how do we find her?
tt2381249,"00:49:12,863","00:49:15,297",She said we've everything we need.
tt2381249,"00:49:54,770","00:49:56,909",We had an agreement.
tt2381249,"00:49:56,934","00:49:58,785","You send me to do a job, I'd do it."
tt2381249,"00:49:58,810","00:50:01,763","- But my way, not yours. - When did I deviate?"
tt2381249,"00:50:01,788","00:50:03,949",You put 2 more gunman at the opera tonight.
tt2381249,"00:50:03,974","00:50:05,596",One of them try to kill me.
tt2381249,"00:50:05,621","00:50:06,739",You missed.
tt2381249,"00:50:06,764","00:50:09,361",I missed because Ethan Hunt was there looking for you.
tt2381249,"00:50:09,386","00:50:12,862",Ethan Hunt is in Vienna because you allow him escape in London.
tt2381249,"00:50:12,887","00:50:17,020",Vinter would've kill him in London and that's not what you asked for.
tt2381249,"00:50:17,045","00:50:19,870",Twice now you've let him slipped away.
tt2381249,"00:50:21,184","00:50:22,569",Curious.
tt2381249,"00:50:22,594","00:50:26,070",Are you questioning my loyalty or my ability.
tt2381249,"00:50:26,999","00:50:29,207",- Can't decide. - I've told you before.
tt2381249,"00:50:29,232","00:50:31,425",Trust me or kill me.
tt2381249,"00:50:31,450","00:50:34,433","But If you're going to kill me, be the man."
tt2381249,"00:50:35,480","00:50:37,727",Do it yourself.
tt2381249,"00:51:05,290","00:51:07,626",Did he say anything?
tt2381249,"00:51:08,545","00:51:13,389",- He knows about Morocco. - What did he know about Morocco?
tt2381249,"00:51:13,414","00:51:17,778",He knows about the power plant. He doesn't know what's in it.
tt2381249,"00:51:19,090","00:51:21,268","Find him, please."
tt2381249,"00:51:22,009","00:51:23,898",He'll find me.
tt2381249,"00:51:24,628","00:51:26,910",I've him seen to that.
tt2381249,"00:51:31,556","00:51:33,664","- Well, that's interesting - What is it?"
tt2381249,"00:51:33,689","00:51:37,400","It's a SCIF. Secure Computer Facility offline, ultra-contained."
tt2381249,"00:51:37,425","00:51:39,541",It's impossible to hack in from the outside.
tt2381249,"00:51:39,542","00:51:42,086",It's essentially a digital safety deposit box.
tt2381249,"00:51:42,111","00:51:45,778",Very strange thing for a young lady to be carrying in her sundries.
tt2381249,"00:51:45,803","00:51:50,164",- Where's it located? - Morocco.
tt2381249,"00:51:51,385","00:51:53,239",Morocco.
tt2381249,"00:51:54,767","00:51:57,928",CASABLANCA MOROCCO
tt2381249,"00:53:08,480","00:53:12,246","Now, what brings you gentlemen to Casablanca?"
tt2381249,"00:53:41,778","00:53:45,959",- Good to see you - What couldn't you tell me over the telephone?
tt2381249,"00:53:47,129","00:53:50,049",The Chancellor of Austria was assassinated.
tt2381249,"00:53:50,074","00:53:52,960",We believe that Ethan and Benji were there.
tt2381249,"00:53:52,985","00:53:56,604",Huntley's handed this over to Special Activities Division.
tt2381249,"00:53:57,008","00:54:00,142",We need to find Ethan before they do.
tt2381249,"00:54:00,609","00:54:02,911",That's where you come in.
tt2381249,"00:54:04,367","00:54:07,361","- Not interested. - Okay. Look, Luther."
tt2381249,"00:54:07,386","00:54:11,637","Look, man. I know Ethan. I don't know you."
tt2381249,"00:54:11,951","00:54:14,937",All I know about you is that you chose to work for Hunley.
tt2381249,"00:54:14,963","00:54:18,591","Yeah, all I know about you is you chose to resign."
tt2381249,"00:54:18,616","00:54:21,337",You don't have to worry about Ethan.
tt2381249,"00:54:21,362","00:54:24,416","- They'll never catch him - No, they're not going to catch him. No."
tt2381249,"00:54:24,441","00:54:26,812","This is the CIA, this is Hunley we're talking about."
tt2381249,"00:54:26,837","00:54:30,320",Thing are out of control And they're going to kill him.
tt2381249,"00:54:30,815","00:54:34,170",They're going to kill Ethan. They're going to kill Benji.
tt2381249,"00:54:34,229","00:54:38,021",We have to get to them first. Are you going to help me?
tt2381249,"00:54:44,461","00:54:47,164",You need to understand something.
tt2381249,"00:54:47,943","00:54:50,484",Ethan is my friend
tt2381249,"00:54:50,819","00:54:54,884",And if I have 1 second of doubt whose side you're on.
tt2381249,"00:54:57,624","00:54:59,743",I believe you
tt2381249,"00:55:00,688","00:55:02,714",- Alright. - Alright.
tt2381249,"00:55:02,739","00:55:06,163",- What do I have to go on? - Not much.
tt2381249,"00:55:06,188","00:55:08,369",And not a lot of time.
tt2381249,"00:55:09,834","00:55:14,598",His name is Solomon Lane. He created the Syndicate.
tt2381249,"00:55:14,623","00:55:16,614",Where does he come from?
tt2381249,"00:55:17,090","00:55:19,876",He's former British intelligence.
tt2381249,"00:55:20,163","00:55:22,680","Well. If British intelligence knows the Syndicate exist,"
tt2381249,"00:55:22,705","00:55:24,889",why don't they just tell the CIA?
tt2381249,"00:55:24,914","00:55:30,157",Because they don't want anyone knowing the Syndicate was created by one of their own.
tt2381249,"00:55:30,476","00:55:33,308",I was sent undercover to earn Lane's trust.
tt2381249,"00:55:33,333","00:55:36,586",And eventually identifying the members of his organization.
tt2381249,"00:55:36,611","00:55:39,120","For the first time in 2 years,"
tt2381249,"00:55:39,145","00:55:41,607",I'm close to knowing who they are.
tt2381249,"00:55:41,632","00:55:46,176","Lane had a ledger. It contain the identities of his operatives,"
tt2381249,"00:55:46,201","00:55:50,161","his terrorist associates, the entire inner workings of the Syndicate."
tt2381249,"00:55:50,186","00:55:53,368",One of his agents stole it hoping to blackmail him.
tt2381249,"00:55:53,393","00:55:57,500",He kept it in a secure computer facility for safe keeping.
tt2381249,"00:55:57,525","00:56:00,303",He died being interrogated for the access code.
tt2381249,"00:56:00,328","00:56:03,264",Leaving Lane with a serious problem.
tt2381249,"00:56:04,318","00:56:10,951",So the key to crushing Lane is sitting in a computer just waiting for someone to take it?
tt2381249,"00:56:11,197","00:56:14,946",So why hasn't Lane just send someone to steal it?
tt2381249,"00:56:15,048","00:56:19,497","Oh, he has. He sent me."
tt2381249,"00:56:19,626","00:56:21,515",And I can tell you.
tt2381249,"00:56:22,401","00:56:24,526",It's impossible.
tt2381249,"00:56:27,833","00:56:31,469",The facility is hidden beneath the local power plant under military guard.
tt2381249,"00:56:31,494","00:56:36,897",And the only way to download the ledger is through the central computer terminal located there.
tt2381249,"00:56:37,629","00:56:41,164","To reach the terminal, you'll need to pass the main gates."
tt2381249,"00:56:41,653","00:56:45,144",Access the elevator with fingerprint recognition
tt2381249,"00:56:45,664","00:56:49,050",And open 3 separate combination locks.
tt2381249,"00:56:54,090","00:56:57,219","Well, that's easy. We just impersonate the agent who stole the ledger in the first place."
tt2381249,"00:56:57,244","00:57:00,068",And. I get to wear a mask.
tt2381249,"00:57:22,109","00:57:26,288","Unfortunately, even if you can make it through every other security measure"
tt2381249,"00:57:26,313","00:57:30,126",you won't beat the last one. That's because it's protected by gait analysis.
tt2381249,"00:57:30,151","00:57:32,373",A step beyond facial recognition.
tt2381249,"00:57:32,398","00:57:35,166","These cameras actually know how the agent walks,"
tt2381249,"00:57:35,191","00:57:39,618","how he talks, how he moves, right down to his facial takes."
tt2381249,"00:57:46,781","00:57:48,781","So, what you're saying is, no mask can beat it."
tt2381249,"00:57:48,806","00:57:50,250",We're busted before we could even get into the vault.
tt2381249,"00:57:50,275","00:57:54,366",And I wind up in a Morocco jail playing mommies and daddies without a mother strangler.
tt2381249,"00:57:54,391","00:57:56,473","Okay, I don't get to wear a mask."
tt2381249,"00:57:56,498","00:57:59,443",- And there's no other way into the computer lab? - No other way in.
tt2381249,"00:57:59,468","00:58:01,816",- Air Shaft? - 6 inch diameter pipe.
tt2381249,"00:58:01,841","00:58:05,467","- Foundation? - 12 feet of concrete, top and bottom."
tt2381249,"00:58:05,492","00:58:07,169","- Electrical conduit? - Bottom line is,"
tt2381249,"00:58:07,194","00:58:08,861",there's no way into that terminal unless
tt2381249,"00:58:08,886","00:58:13,076",your profile is pre-installed in the security system.
tt2381249,"00:58:13,628","00:58:15,267",Profile?
tt2381249,"00:58:15,843","00:58:17,355",Where're the profile stored?
tt2381249,"00:58:17,380","00:58:21,482",All security data is stored offline in the liquid cooler aid.
tt2381249,"00:58:21,521","00:58:24,584","Here, inside the torus, liquid cooled."
tt2381249,"00:58:24,609","00:58:26,507",You mean that thing is under water?
tt2381249,"00:58:26,532","00:58:28,685",- Yes. - Yes.
tt2381249,"00:58:28,710","00:58:29,790",Okay.
tt2381249,"00:58:29,815","00:58:34,149","So, to get the ledger, one of us needs to enter the  torus"
tt2381249,"00:58:34,425","00:58:37,311",and change the security profile.
tt2381249,"00:58:38,413","00:58:42,404",So that the other one can access the computer without being caught.
tt2381249,"00:58:43,678","00:58:47,694",- That's the only way. - That's the only way.
tt2381249,"00:58:48,583","00:58:49,819",Can I get in through there.
tt2381249,"00:58:49,844","00:58:52,068",- What's that? - That's the service hatch.
tt2381249,"00:58:52,093","00:58:55,580","It can only be opened from the inside If you try and open it from the outside,"
tt2381249,"00:58:55,616","00:58:59,026",you'll be hit with 70 thousand gallons of pressurized water.
tt2381249,"00:58:59,051","00:59:02,344",- Where does the water come from? - Desalinized seawater flows through the intake.
tt2381249,"00:59:02,369","00:59:04,699",in the pipeline. And before you ask.
tt2381249,"00:59:04,724","00:59:10,063",The system is designed to shut down automatically if any metal enters the intake.
tt2381249,"00:59:10,088","00:59:12,615",No oxygen tanks.
tt2381249,"00:59:13,913","00:59:18,360","Alright. Well, how long will it take to free swim from the intake to the service hatch."
tt2381249,"00:59:18,401","00:59:20,782",2 minutes. With the current at full power.
tt2381249,"00:59:20,806","00:59:23,295","Well. Then, you just have to hold your breath for 2 minutes."
tt2381249,"00:59:23,321","00:59:27,191",- What about installing the security profile? - Well. That's gonna be like a minute tops.
tt2381249,"00:59:27,216","00:59:29,189","So, I have to hold my breath for 3 minutes?"
tt2381249,"00:59:29,214","00:59:30,373",You can do that.
tt2381249,"00:59:30,398","00:59:32,624","But I think you're overlooking, is the physical exertion."
tt2381249,"00:59:32,649","00:59:35,760","The more you exert yourself, the faster you consume oxygen."
tt2381249,"00:59:35,785","00:59:37,305",Don't worry about him. Alright.
tt2381249,"00:59:37,306","00:59:40,999",All he has to do is install the fake profile before I get to the gait analysis.
tt2381249,"00:59:41,024","00:59:43,415","You said it yourself, it's the only way"
tt2381249,"00:59:43,440","00:59:46,046",That doesn't sound impossible.

tt2381249,"00:59:56,160","00:59:58,977","So, how are we suppose to find Ethan and Benji before they do?"
tt2381249,"00:59:59,002","01:00:02,791",I'm not even looking for them. I'm looking for her.
tt2381249,"01:00:02,886","01:00:04,663",What do you mean?
tt2381249,"01:00:05,165","01:00:08,789","These sketches, what do you see?"
tt2381249,"01:00:09,968","01:00:13,549",Ethan's not exactly sure who this guys is.
tt2381249,"01:00:14,610","01:00:18,177","But this woman, he knows her."
tt2381249,"01:00:18,202","01:00:20,030",He trust her.
tt2381249,"01:00:20,055","01:00:22,709","I'm betting that if he's not already with her, he's on his way."
tt2381249,"01:00:22,710","01:00:24,232","Find her, find Ethan."
tt2381249,"01:00:24,257","01:00:26,702",Tell me it's possible to pull facial recognition of a sketch.
tt2381249,"01:00:26,727","01:00:30,811","For mere mortals, no. For me, I could've done this at home."
tt2381249,"01:00:30,836","01:00:32,593",Alright.
tt2381249,"01:00:36,539","01:00:39,255",- How long is this going to take? - Found her.
tt2381249,"01:00:41,654","01:00:46,075",CCTV picked her up at the airport in Casablanca.

tt2381249,"01:03:31,930","01:03:33,965","And a slightly more important note,"

tt2381249,"01:03:36,940","01:03:38,282",I'm dead.

tt2381249,"01:21:17,332","01:21:19,972",Of course I made a copy.
tt2381249,"01:21:27,354","01:21:29,354",So where are we going?
tt2381249,"01:21:53,287","01:21:54,491",It's a ledger.
tt2381249,"01:21:54,516","01:21:56,707",The Syndicate's entire infrastructure.
tt2381249,"01:21:56,732","01:22:00,040","Who they are, the politicians they control, and where the money comes from."
tt2381249,"01:22:00,549","01:22:02,704",It's everything you want to know.
tt2381249,"01:22:02,737","01:22:06,874",What makes you think this so-called ledger is authentic?
tt2381249,"01:22:06,899","01:22:09,514",Why would Lane want it so badly if it wasn't authentic?
tt2381249,"01:22:09,539","01:22:12,066",Why would he ever let you have it if it was?
tt2381249,"01:22:12,091","01:22:15,391",Did you never stop to consider he may want me to have it?
tt2381249,"01:22:15,416","01:22:16,958","Misinformation, manipulation."
tt2381249,"01:22:16,983","01:22:19,605","What he does exercise, what he's trained to do."
tt2381249,"01:22:19,630","01:22:22,909","Lane lies to you, you sell his lies to Hunt."
tt2381249,"01:22:22,934","01:22:24,603","Together, you both are compromised."
tt2381249,"01:22:24,628","01:22:27,012",That's his ultimate objective.
tt2381249,"01:22:27,037","01:22:28,915",This may be authentic.
tt2381249,"01:22:28,940","01:22:34,194",But there's only one person I trust to verify that information. You.
tt2381249,"01:22:35,668","01:22:37,136",No.
tt2381249,"01:22:38,443","01:22:41,207",My orders were to deliver you information regarding the Syndicate.
tt2381249,"01:22:41,232","01:22:46,487",Your orders were to infiltrate the Syndicate that we may learn more about them first hand.
tt2381249,"01:22:46,512","01:22:48,781","This isn't prove, it's a test, like everything else."
tt2381249,"01:22:48,806","01:22:51,336","The only way to pass, is to go back."
tt2381249,"01:22:51,361","01:22:52,815",I can't do that.
tt2381249,"01:22:52,840","01:22:55,546",I betrayed Lane's trust too many times.
tt2381249,"01:22:55,571","01:22:57,880","And in every instance, you did so on you own volition."
tt2381249,"01:22:57,905","01:23:00,641",He was going to tortured and killed an American agent.
tt2381249,"01:23:00,666","01:23:04,155","And you should've let him, and you would still have Lane's trust."
tt2381249,"01:23:04,180","01:23:06,281","This is the trade, Hunt understands that."
tt2381249,"01:23:06,306","01:23:08,846",I wasn't going to let him die. He is our ally.
tt2381249,"01:23:08,871","01:23:13,424","There are no allies in state craft, Ilsa. Only common interest."
tt2381249,"01:23:13,449","01:23:17,143","As it stands, Ethan Hunt is a man without a country."
tt2381249,"01:23:17,168","01:23:21,876",This makes killing him decidedly less complicated.
tt2381249,"01:23:23,038","01:23:24,896",Are you ordering me to kill Hunt?
tt2381249,"01:23:24,921","01:23:27,928","Good god, no. Nothing so crude as that, no."
tt2381249,"01:23:28,638","01:23:30,811",Lane will order you.
tt2381249,"01:23:30,836","01:23:36,010","And to regain his trust, you will do it."
tt2381249,"01:23:36,496","01:23:39,677",You sent me to do a job.
tt2381249,"01:23:39,702","01:23:41,595",I did it.
tt2381249,"01:23:41,751","01:23:43,783","Now, you bring me in."
tt2381249,"01:23:43,807","01:23:48,017","Might I remind you, you're without a country of your own."
tt2381249,"01:23:48,320","01:23:51,309",The director of the CIA called me inquiring about you personally.
tt2381249,"01:23:51,334","01:23:53,887","Of course to protect your cover, I had to lie."
tt2381249,"01:23:53,912","01:23:55,390","So, as far as the Americans are concern,"
tt2381249,"01:23:55,415","01:23:59,264","you're a rogue assassin, a target of opportunity."
tt2381249,"01:23:59,440","01:24:02,740",A precious few people know about your true identity.
tt2381249,"01:24:02,765","01:24:08,111",It would be unfortunate if we forgot.
tt2381249,"01:24:08,445","01:24:11,470","You see, there really is no choice ,Ilsa."
tt2381249,"01:24:11,495","01:24:13,789",You're going back.
tt2381249,"01:24:20,844","01:24:24,258",Glad to know you're still with us.
tt2381249,"01:24:32,073","01:24:33,353",What? What's happening?
tt2381249,"01:24:33,354","01:24:34,811",I can't open it.
tt2381249,"01:24:34,812","01:24:36,029",What do you mean you can't open it?
tt2381249,"01:24:36,054","01:24:38,299","I mean I can't open it, ever."
tt2381249,"01:24:38,324","01:24:40,112",That's a red box.
tt2381249,"01:24:40,137","01:24:42,003",- A what? - It's a red box.
tt2381249,"01:24:42,028","01:24:44,950",The British government uses it to transport national secrets.
tt2381249,"01:24:44,975","01:24:46,024",Doesn't sound good.
tt2381249,"01:24:46,049","01:24:48,545",Meaning it's triple encrypted. You don't get into that thing
tt2381249,"01:24:48,570","01:24:54,024","unless you have fingerprints, retinal scan, and a voice phrase spoken by a specific individual."
tt2381249,"01:24:54,049","01:24:56,454",The Prime Minister of Great Britain himself.
tt2381249,"01:24:56,479","01:24:57,662","Yes, him."
tt2381249,"01:24:57,687","01:24:59,747","So, what you're saying is, there is no ledger."
tt2381249,"01:24:59,748","01:25:02,258",which means we have no proof that the Syndicate even exist.
tt2381249,"01:25:02,283","01:25:03,741","So, we're back to square one."
tt2381249,"01:25:03,766","01:25:06,331","Only now, we're all wanted by the CIA."
tt2381249,"01:25:06,356","01:25:08,273",I'm so proud of us.
tt2381249,"01:25:08,298","01:25:13,801",What I don't understand is why is there a red box sat in a private data vault in Morocco.
tt2381249,"01:25:13,826","01:25:16,155",And why would Lane want it if he can't open it?
tt2381249,"01:25:16,180","01:25:19,506","If Lane wants it, you can bet that he has a plan to open it."
tt2381249,"01:25:20,687","01:25:23,337",And we just help him steal it.
tt2381249,"01:25:26,497","01:25:28,558",He's going to take the Prime Minister.
tt2381249,"01:25:28,573","01:25:30,358","Yes, he is."
tt2381249,"01:25:30,547","01:25:31,738",The question is how?
tt2381249,"01:25:31,763","01:25:33,342","Well, we have to warn the British government."
tt2381249,"01:25:33,367","01:25:35,369","- Yeah, MI6. - No, no, Brandt."
tt2381249,"01:25:35,394","01:25:37,094",Put down the phone. Let's think about this.
tt2381249,"01:25:37,119","01:25:39,595","We have a responsibility to warn the British government,"
tt2381249,"01:25:39,620","01:25:42,105",and not gamble with the Prime Minister's life.
tt2381249,"01:25:42,130","01:25:44,905","Ethan, just so you can beat the guy"
tt2381249,"01:25:44,930","01:25:48,171",that's beaten you at every turn.
tt2381249,"01:25:49,647","01:25:51,887",Is that what you think this is?
tt2381249,"01:25:51,950","01:25:53,528",Brandt?
tt2381249,"01:25:55,793","01:25:58,320",Is that what you think this is?
tt2381249,"01:25:58,745","01:26:00,041","I think right now,"
tt2381249,"01:26:00,066","01:26:02,173",you're incapable of seeing that there's another way.
tt2381249,"01:26:02,198","01:26:05,701",And sometimes Ethan is the only one capable of seeing the only way.
tt2381249,"01:26:05,726","01:26:08,363","And if he's wrong, then we have Vienna"
tt2381249,"01:26:08,388","01:26:09,478",all over again.
tt2381249,"01:26:09,503","01:26:12,235","No, you don't know him. If he wants something to happen,"
tt2381249,"01:26:12,260","01:26:13,637",there's no preventing it.
tt2381249,"01:26:13,662","01:26:15,673",That's why we have to warn the British.
tt2381249,"01:26:15,698","01:26:18,078",Maybe that's exactly what he wants us to do.
tt2381249,"01:26:18,103","01:26:20,310",Are you listening to yourself? We're going to  warn the British.
tt2381249,"01:26:20,335","01:26:22,916","No. We're going to find Lane, we're going to get him."
tt2381249,"01:26:22,941","01:26:25,533",Before he takes the Prime Minister.
tt2381249,"01:26:30,210","01:26:31,617",Okay.
tt2381249,"01:26:31,642","01:26:34,556","Alright, Ethan. We're going to find Lane."
tt2381249,"01:26:34,581","01:26:36,487",But please tell me.
tt2381249,"01:26:36,488","01:26:38,819",How're we going to do that?
tt2381249,"01:27:17,527","01:27:19,194",All is forgiven.
tt2381249,"01:27:19,219","01:27:21,323","That isn't a ledger, is it?"
tt2381249,"01:27:21,348","01:27:23,633",You didn't take a look for yourself?
tt2381249,"01:27:23,658","01:27:25,083",Of course I did.
tt2381249,"01:27:25,084","01:27:26,842",But the file was encrypted.
tt2381249,"01:27:26,843","01:27:28,368",And why would I lie to you?
tt2381249,"01:27:28,393","01:27:30,689",So that I would lie to Hunt.
tt2381249,"01:27:31,949","01:27:35,431",But he wouldn't have stolen it if he knew what it was.
tt2381249,"01:27:36,077","01:27:38,369",And she wouldn't have helped him.
tt2381249,"01:27:39,747","01:27:41,827",What is actually on that disk?
tt2381249,"01:27:41,852","01:27:45,569",I'll be honest with you when you start being honest with me.
tt2381249,"01:27:46,322","01:27:48,971","And you and I, we both know why you come back."
tt2381249,"01:27:48,996","01:27:50,843",Don't we?
tt2381249,"01:27:52,974","01:27:56,006",You're still alive because I believe in your potential.
tt2381249,"01:27:56,031","01:27:58,538",But I'm growing impatient.
tt2381249,"01:27:59,343","01:28:02,483",Why do you continue to resist?
tt2381249,"01:28:05,843","01:28:07,871","Well, if we're being honest,"
tt2381249,"01:28:08,504","01:28:09,957",You're a terrorist.
tt2381249,"01:28:09,982","01:28:13,840","If that were true then my goal would be to spread fear, but my..."
tt2381249,"01:28:13,865","01:28:17,866",method is... far more surgical.
tt2381249,"01:28:19,038","01:28:21,014",You kill innocent people.
tt2381249,"01:28:21,039","01:28:26,067","I helped my government killed many innocent people and more, so much more."
tt2381249,"01:28:26,676","01:28:29,669",Killing to keep things as they were.
tt2381249,"01:28:29,694","01:28:33,559",And now I'm killing to bring about change.
tt2381249,"01:28:33,771","01:28:36,460",I think Ethan Hunt would disagree.
tt2381249,"01:28:36,485","01:28:38,668",Ethan Hunt is a gambler.
tt2381249,"01:28:38,693","01:28:40,935","And one day his luck will run out,"
tt2381249,"01:28:40,960","01:28:44,653",And thousands of innocent people will pay the price.
tt2381249,"01:28:44,678","01:28:47,788",Which one of us will be the villain then?
tt2381249,"01:28:50,736","01:28:53,686",Nothing here. It's empty.
tt2381249,"01:29:09,656","01:29:11,083",I'm interested
tt2381249,"01:29:11,108","01:29:13,667",to see who you blame
tt2381249,"01:29:14,646","01:29:17,244",for what happens next.
tt2381249,"01:30:03,915","01:30:05,387","So, that's her?"
tt2381249,"01:30:05,388","01:30:07,494",That's her.
tt2381249,"01:30:10,211","01:30:12,211",I have to say
tt2381249,"01:30:13,126","01:30:15,324",you sure can ride.
tt2381249,"01:30:17,566","01:30:20,297",- Ethan. - You're just doing your job.
tt2381249,"01:30:21,184","01:30:23,662",That's all I'm going to say about it.
tt2381249,"01:30:24,910","01:30:26,721",Atlee said you'd understand.
tt2381249,"01:30:26,746","01:30:30,525","Atlee, your handler in British Intelligence."
tt2381249,"01:30:33,283","01:30:35,607",And he didn't bring you in?
tt2381249,"01:30:37,041","01:30:39,663",Even after you gave him the disk?
tt2381249,"01:30:39,688","01:30:42,799",You knew perfectly well it was blank.
tt2381249,"01:30:42,824","01:30:46,550",That's a lie. The disk she took from me was an exact copy. I'm of it.
tt2381249,"01:30:46,575","01:30:49,660",Was it in your possession the entire time?
tt2381249,"01:30:54,418","01:30:55,522","<font color=""#e4adc0"">DELETING FILES</font>"
tt2381249,"01:30:55,547","01:30:56,810","<font color=""#e4adc0"">FILES DELETED</font>"
tt2381249,"01:30:59,620","01:31:01,234",Oh.
tt2381249,"01:31:01,287","01:31:04,607",They don't care if you live or die.
tt2381249,"01:31:11,314","01:31:14,394",But you knew I was going to take it to him.
tt2381249,"01:31:14,419","01:31:15,953",I hope you would.
tt2381249,"01:31:15,978","01:31:18,687",I hope it would be enough to get you out.
tt2381249,"01:31:18,972","01:31:22,049","Whoa-whoa-whoa. That means Lane doesn't have the disk, only we do."
tt2381249,"01:31:22,074","01:31:25,154","I have a question. If the disk was blank,"
tt2381249,"01:31:25,179","01:31:27,337",why is she still alive?
tt2381249,"01:31:27,362","01:31:29,251","Unless, of course,"
tt2381249,"01:31:29,252","01:31:31,659",Lane wanted us to find her.
tt2381249,"01:31:32,840","01:31:35,334","So, who're you working for now?"
tt2381249,"01:31:35,628","01:31:39,701","Lane, Atlee, your government, my government, they're all the same"
tt2381249,"01:31:39,974","01:31:44,442",We only think we're fighting for the right side because that's what we choose to believe.
tt2381249,"01:31:45,356","01:31:47,341",So what does that leave us?
tt2381249,"01:31:47,342","01:31:50,123","The way I see it, you have 3 choices."
tt2381249,"01:31:50,152","01:31:53,878","One, you hand me and the disk over to the CIA."
tt2381249,"01:31:53,903","01:31:55,718",I'm proof that Syndicate exist.
tt2381249,"01:31:55,743","01:31:59,244","Lane becomes their problem, and... your work is done."
tt2381249,"01:31:59,269","01:32:01,779",- My thoughts exactly. - Works for me.
tt2381249,"01:32:01,804","01:32:03,876",But you know they're not going to believe you.
tt2381249,"01:32:03,901","01:32:06,713",And you all will be trialed for treason.
tt2381249,"01:32:06,738","01:32:08,215",Lane goes free.
tt2381249,"01:32:08,240","01:32:10,148",I'm afraid she's has a point.
tt2381249,"01:32:10,149","01:32:14,226","Two, you let me walk away to an uncertain fate."
tt2381249,"01:32:14,251","01:32:17,915",You use the disk as bait to trap Lane.
tt2381249,"01:32:18,209","01:32:20,992",But some part of you suspect you've met your match.
tt2381249,"01:32:21,017","01:32:23,711","And being a gambler, you'll probably end up handing Lane that disk"
tt2381249,"01:32:23,736","01:32:26,020",whether you want to or not.
tt2381249,"01:32:26,045","01:32:28,292",That is entirely possible.
tt2381249,"01:32:28,317","01:32:30,317",And option three?
tt2381249,"01:32:30,382","01:32:32,643",Come away with me.
tt2381249,"01:32:33,570","01:32:35,654",Right now.
tt2381249,"01:32:38,051","01:32:40,548",Oh boy.
tt2381249,"01:32:43,525","01:32:45,298",And what about Lane?
tt2381249,"01:32:45,299","01:32:47,449",Forget about Lane.
tt2381249,"01:32:47,474","01:32:49,937",There will always be another Lane.
tt2381249,"01:32:49,962","01:32:53,307",There will always be people like us to face him.
tt2381249,"01:32:53,682","01:32:57,195",We've done our part and we've been cast aside.
tt2381249,"01:32:57,708","01:33:00,316",We can be anyone.
tt2381249,"01:33:00,341","01:33:02,911",We can do anything.
tt2381249,"01:33:04,262","01:33:06,755",It's only a matter of going.
tt2381249,"01:33:19,629","01:33:22,923","Lane sent you to deliver a message, didn't he?"
tt2381249,"01:33:23,254","01:33:26,201",I saved you life twice. I won't be able to do it again.
tt2381249,"01:33:26,226","01:33:28,379",What's the message?
tt2381249,"01:33:40,819","01:33:42,545",Benji.
tt2381249,"01:33:54,587","01:33:56,062",Parking garage
tt2381249,"01:33:56,087","01:33:58,279","Luther, stay with her."
tt2381249,"01:34:21,890","01:34:23,127",She's gone.
tt2381249,"01:34:23,152","01:34:25,152",I lost her.
tt2381249,"01:34:27,672","01:34:30,051","She set us up, Ethan."
tt2381249,"01:34:30,076","01:34:31,938","No, she delivered a message."
tt2381249,"01:34:31,963","01:34:33,565",She set us up!
tt2381249,"01:34:33,590","01:34:34,841",She knew this would happen.
tt2381249,"01:34:34,866","01:34:38,722",Only Lane knows what's going to happen.
tt2381249,"01:34:43,702","01:34:45,536","I have a job for you, Ethan."
tt2381249,"01:34:45,561","01:34:48,318","And for the sake of your friend, you will do it."
tt2381249,"01:34:48,343","01:34:49,477",I'm listening.
tt2381249,"01:34:49,502","01:34:52,426","Your mission, should you choose to accept it,"
tt2381249,"01:34:52,451","01:34:56,058",Is to bring me the unlocked disk by midnight today.
tt2381249,"01:34:56,083","01:34:58,704","Now say the words, please."
tt2381249,"01:34:59,086","01:35:01,086",I accept.
tt2381249,"01:35:01,480","01:35:03,257",Yes.
tt2381249,"01:35:05,739","01:35:07,739",I knew you would.
tt2381249,"01:35:14,377","01:35:19,429","He wants the disk, unlocked, by midnight tonight"
tt2381249,"01:35:19,454","01:35:24,971","Ethan, there's only one person on earth who can unlock that disk."
tt2381249,"01:35:25,231","01:35:28,017",We have to take the Prime Minister.
tt2381249,"01:35:28,507","01:35:31,437",Let's just think about that for a minute.
tt2381249,"01:35:32,487","01:35:34,756",That's the only way to get Benji back.
tt2381249,"01:35:34,781","01:35:38,299","Ethan, that's exactly what Lane wants you to do."
tt2381249,"01:35:38,324","01:35:41,967",Which is why it has to happen.
tt2381249,"01:35:45,844","01:35:48,351",This is how we beat Lane.
tt2381249,"01:35:48,615","01:35:50,898",This is how we make everything right.
tt2381249,"01:35:50,923","01:35:55,190",Can you see? Can you see it?
tt2381249,"01:36:08,478","01:36:12,888","William Brandt, sir. He says it's urgent."
tt2381249,"01:36:16,885","01:36:18,961","I had a feeling you'd come to your senses, Brandt."
tt2381249,"01:36:18,992","01:36:21,494",I'm only calling you because I've no other choice.
tt2381249,"01:36:21,519","01:36:23,377",I'm trying to prevent a catastrophe.
tt2381249,"01:36:23,402","01:36:26,336",I can understand that. Where are you?
tt2381249,"01:36:27,461","01:36:30,947","- London - Reroute us to London, now."
tt2381249,"01:36:30,972","01:36:33,712","- Where in London? - I'll tell you when you land, not before."
tt2381249,"01:36:33,737","01:36:35,701","I'm not interested in playing games, Brandt."
tt2381249,"01:36:35,726","01:36:38,830",And I'm not interested in seeing my friends get killed either.
tt2381249,"01:36:38,855","01:36:41,376","So if I'm going to betray them, we're going to do this in my terms"
tt2381249,"01:36:41,401","01:36:43,344",and my terms only. Do you understand?
tt2381249,"01:36:43,369","01:36:46,338","Keep your phone on, instruction will follow."
tt2381249,"01:36:51,860","01:36:55,600",- Should have been gone by now. - Yeah.
tt2381249,"01:36:57,987","01:37:00,654",- You okay? - Yeah.
tt2381249,"01:37:02,711","01:37:07,019",We're suppose to take down the Prime Minister of Great Britain tonight.
tt2381249,"01:37:07,373","01:37:09,195",So...
tt2381249,"01:37:10,277","01:37:11,984",Brandt.
tt2381249,"01:37:14,737","01:37:17,762",I cant' see another way.
tt2381249,"01:37:19,659","01:37:21,808",Neither can I.
tt2381249,"01:37:23,766","01:37:27,081","What we do, we have to do for our friends, right?"
tt2381249,"01:38:11,584","01:38:13,856","Get him ready, please."
tt2381249,"01:38:38,428","01:38:40,467","You're right to call me, Brandt. Where is Hunt?"
tt2381249,"01:38:40,492","01:38:42,440",He's on his way. We don't have much time.
tt2381249,"01:38:42,465","01:38:45,212",- What does he intend to do? - What matter is he's alive.
tt2381249,"01:38:45,237","01:38:49,558",And I need your reassurance that it's going to stay that way.
tt2381249,"01:39:04,406","01:39:07,755",Have you informed the British Government that Hunt has targeted the Prime Minister?
tt2381249,"01:39:07,780","01:39:12,967",I will help you capture him... alive. That is the deal.
tt2381249,"01:39:18,540","01:39:21,163","You picked up some terrible habits from your friend, Brandt"
tt2381249,"01:39:21,188","01:39:25,517",The worst of them being that you still believe you can control any outcome.
tt2381249,"01:39:25,542","01:39:27,484",Stay with him.
tt2381249,"01:39:31,056","01:39:33,358",Chief Atlee. Chief Atlee.
tt2381249,"01:39:33,383","01:39:35,741","Director Hunley, how delightful to see you here."
tt2381249,"01:39:35,766","01:39:39,703","Last time we spoke, you were hunting rogue agents in Morocco."
tt2381249,"01:39:39,728","01:39:44,336","Chief Atlee, I have reason to believe that the Prime Minister's life is in danger."
tt2381249,"01:39:46,812","01:39:48,906",I'm listening.
tt2381249,"01:39:51,402","01:39:55,266","Any advance on 22,000? Anyone?"
tt2381249,"01:39:55,291","01:39:57,996",Going once. Going twice.
tt2381249,"01:39:58,021","01:40:00,890",Sold! To our generous Chairwoman.
tt2381249,"01:40:00,925","01:40:03,866",Sir. Chief Atlee from MI6 needs to see you.
tt2381249,"01:40:03,891","01:40:06,180",He says it's urgent.
tt2381249,"01:40:06,785","01:40:08,747",Excuse me.
tt2381249,"01:40:18,828","01:40:23,479","- What's this all about? - It's a matter of national security, Sir."
tt2381249,"01:40:30,012","01:40:34,755",- Under no circumstances is anyone to enter. - Yes sir.
tt2381249,"01:40:35,842","01:40:38,174",Help me to understand.
tt2381249,"01:40:38,199","01:40:40,960",Who is this man? Why is he after me?
tt2381249,"01:40:40,985","01:40:46,075","I'm afraid, Prime Minister, Director Hunley and I share responsibility for this."
tt2381249,"01:40:46,100","01:40:50,535",Ethan Hunt was part of a disgrace intelligence agency which is since been dissolved.
tt2381249,"01:40:50,560","01:40:55,873","And he's gone rogue, unfortunately intend on dismantling  an imaginary terror network."
tt2381249,"01:40:55,898","01:41:00,097",Our new intelligence suggest that he's been manipulated by one of your own former agent.
tt2381249,"01:41:00,122","01:41:03,210","Ilsa Faust, Prime Minister. She disappeared 2 years ago."
tt2381249,"01:41:03,235","01:41:04,903","And if you don't mind I asking,"
tt2381249,"01:41:04,928","01:41:07,229",what do I have to do with this phantom network?
tt2381249,"01:41:07,254","01:41:10,185","Sir, this is William Brandt, a former colleague of Hunt's."
tt2381249,"01:41:10,210","01:41:13,495",He came forward with first hand knowledge of the plot against you.
tt2381249,"01:41:13,520","01:41:18,104",Sir. Hunt is in possession of a virtual red box that can only be open by you.
tt2381249,"01:41:18,129","01:41:22,200",He believes it is the key to bring down the Syndicate.
tt2381249,"01:41:23,320","01:41:28,577","- The Syndicate, you say? - Yes, Sir. That's what he calls it."
tt2381249,"01:41:29,100","01:41:30,824",Atlee.
tt2381249,"01:41:30,849","01:41:36,060","He couldn't possibly be talking about that ""Syndicate""?"
tt2381249,"01:41:37,586","01:41:41,653","'Cause you assured me that, that ""Syndicate"" was merely an exercise?"
tt2381249,"01:41:41,678","01:41:45,064","And it was, Prime Minister. I can assure you."
tt2381249,"01:41:45,089","01:41:48,261","And yet, here we have the Central Intelligence Agency indicating otherwise."
tt2381249,"01:41:48,286","01:41:51,912","- I don't understand. - Prime Minister, your life is in danger."
tt2381249,"01:41:51,937","01:41:55,350",I think our first priority is to move you to a secure location. - Sir.
tt2381249,"01:41:55,375","01:41:59,673","Does the name Solomon Lane, ring a bell?"
tt2381249,"01:42:00,499","01:42:07,119","Yes. Unfortunately, it does."
tt2381249,"01:42:08,404","01:42:11,366","So, there actually is a Syndicate?"
tt2381249,"01:42:11,391","01:42:15,545",It was a hypothetical brainchild of Chief Atlee.
tt2381249,"01:42:15,579","01:42:19,891",Recruit former agents from other nations. supply them with a new identity
tt2381249,"01:42:19,916","01:42:24,442","and use them to surgically remove our enemies, both at home and abroad."
tt2381249,"01:42:24,467","01:42:30,375",It's operating budget was to be hidden offshore in a virtual red box which I alone would control
tt2381249,"01:42:30,400","01:42:34,447","It would've made me judge, jury and executioner with zero accountability."
tt2381249,"01:42:34,472","01:42:37,113",I rejected the proposal unequivocally.
tt2381249,"01:42:37,138","01:42:41,732","Furthermore, I was given every assurance it never pass the planning stage."
tt2381249,"01:42:41,756","01:42:44,619","Prime Minister, there is no any Syndicate."
tt2381249,"01:42:44,644","01:42:47,139",These people have been duped by agent Faust.
tt2381249,"01:42:47,164","01:42:50,731",Atlee. Save it for the public inquiry.
tt2381249,"01:42:50,758","01:42:52,231","Sir, I urge you not to leave this room."
tt2381249,"01:42:52,256","01:42:54,123",- Excuse me. - Please.
tt2381249,"01:42:54,148","01:42:56,622",Hunt is uniquely trained and highly motivated.
tt2381249,"01:42:56,647","01:42:59,892","A specialist without equal, immune to any counter measures."
tt2381249,"01:42:59,917","01:43:04,078",There is no secret he cannot extract. No security he cannot breach.
tt2381249,"01:43:04,103","01:43:06,638",No person he cannot become.
tt2381249,"01:43:06,663","01:43:09,979",He has mostly likely anticipated this very conversation
tt2381249,"01:43:10,004","01:43:13,176",and is waiting to strike in whatever direction we move.
tt2381249,"01:43:13,201","01:43:17,247",Sir. Hunt is the living manifestation of destiny.
tt2381249,"01:43:17,272","01:43:21,305",And he has made you his mission.
tt2381249,"01:43:21,582","01:43:23,578",Prime Minister.
tt2381249,"01:43:39,361","01:43:40,827",Hunt.
tt2381249,"01:43:40,852","01:43:44,042","Sir, please step away from the Prime Minister."
tt2381249,"01:43:47,117","01:43:49,359","Just relax, Sir. Everything is going to be alright."
tt2381249,"01:43:49,384","01:43:53,098","- Atlee shot me - Yes, he did, Sir."
tt2381249,"01:43:55,793","01:44:01,398","Hunt, I hope you realize you set back US, UK relations to the American revolution."
tt2381249,"01:44:01,423","01:44:05,314","Desperate times, desperate measures, sir."
tt2381249,"01:44:07,211","01:44:09,037",- I'm here. - Standby to receive.
tt2381249,"01:44:09,062","01:44:10,689",Ready.
tt2381249,"01:44:16,297","01:44:18,886",The Prime Minister's office ask me to meet him here.
tt2381249,"01:44:18,911","01:44:20,466","This way, sir"
tt2381249,"01:44:20,491","01:44:22,262",Scanning.
tt2381249,"01:44:25,449","01:44:27,897","Retinal scan, confirm."
tt2381249,"01:44:30,483","01:44:32,909","Some convenience, Sir."
tt2381249,"01:44:33,501","01:44:36,585",You got a very warm hand.
tt2381249,"01:44:45,099","01:44:47,536","Biometric, confirm."
tt2381249,"01:44:47,561","01:44:51,427","- The prompt is ""KIPLING"". - The prompt is ""KIPLING""."
tt2381249,"01:44:51,599","01:44:55,705","Sir, I'm gonna need a pass phrase, the prompt is ""KIPLING""."
tt2381249,"01:44:55,730","01:44:57,383","Yes, of course."
tt2381249,"01:44:57,408","01:45:02,243",""" If you can keep your head when all about you. Are losing theirs..."""
tt2381249,"01:45:06,002","01:45:10,373","""If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you"""
tt2381249,"01:45:14,088","01:45:15,991",- You got it? - I got it.
tt2381249,"01:45:16,016","01:45:17,588","Oh man, do I got it."
tt2381249,"01:45:17,613","01:45:21,807",- I'm here to see the Prime Minister. - We were told not to let anybody in.
tt2381249,"01:45:21,832","01:45:25,204","- By whom? - By you, sir."
tt2381249,"01:45:28,319","01:45:32,552","Hunley, what is this? Security!"
tt2381249,"01:45:38,711","01:45:42,737",Chief Atlee. Kind of you to accepted our invitation.
tt2381249,"01:45:42,766","01:45:44,070",Ah.
tt2381249,"01:45:51,674","01:45:54,686",Do you know who I am?
tt2381249,"01:45:56,017","01:45:58,115",We know you created the Syndicate.
tt2381249,"01:45:58,140","01:46:00,971","But Lane went rogue and turn it against you, didn't he?"
tt2381249,"01:46:00,996","01:46:03,459",And you've been desperately trying to cover it up.
tt2381249,"01:46:03,484","01:46:06,326",That's why you erased the disk which she brought it to you.
tt2381249,"01:46:06,351","01:46:09,014",That's true.
tt2381249,"01:46:10,668","01:46:15,348","Now, Director Hunley has some questions for you regarding Ilsa Faust."
tt2381249,"01:46:15,373","01:46:17,841","Namely, how you frame her."
tt2381249,"01:46:17,866","01:46:21,871",That's also true.
tt2381249,"01:46:25,106","01:46:26,556",It's the antidote.
tt2381249,"01:46:26,581","01:46:29,240",When the Prime Minister found out about the Syndicate.
tt2381249,"01:46:29,265","01:46:32,214","- Atlee had attacked him. - Yes, that's true."
tt2381249,"01:46:32,239","01:46:36,707","- And then you saved the Prime Minister, sir. - Did he?"
tt2381249,"01:46:36,847","01:46:39,310",I'm very grateful.
tt2381249,"01:46:49,485","01:46:50,938",Sir.
tt2381249,"01:46:53,226","01:46:56,816","You're cutting it very close, Ethan"
tt2381249,"01:46:57,396","01:47:00,839",I have what you want. Where do I go?
tt2381249,"01:47:17,261","01:47:19,264","Ethan, wait"
tt2381249,"01:47:19,289","01:47:21,529","If I'm not there in 15 minutes, he'll kill Benji."
tt2381249,"01:47:21,554","01:47:23,400",Your mission is to bring down the Syndicate.
tt2381249,"01:47:23,425","01:47:27,695","If Lane gets his hands on that money, we're unleashing a terrorist superpower."
tt2381249,"01:47:27,720","01:47:30,566",He'll never take me alive. I'll make sure of it.
tt2381249,"01:47:30,591","01:47:34,048","What happens, Ethan, if you can't make it back?"
tt2381249,"01:47:34,194","01:47:36,473",I'll make it back.
tt2381249,"01:47:37,228","01:47:39,140",Just be ready.
tt2381249,"01:47:43,473","01:47:46,456","Greetings, Prime Minister. If you are viewing this message,"
tt2381249,"01:47:46,481","01:47:49,368",it means that you have chosen to activate the Syndicate.
tt2381249,"01:47:49,392","01:47:54,755",This drive gives you access to 2.4 billion pound sterling in untraceable currency.
tt2381249,"01:47:54,780","01:47:59,631",That will allow the Syndicate to operate undetected for decades.
tt2381249,"01:47:59,656","01:48:05,102",Instructions to access these funds are as follows.
tt2381249,"01:49:10,689","01:49:13,631","This is the end, Mr. Hunt."
tt2381249,"01:49:22,318","01:49:23,983",Carefully.
tt2381249,"01:49:26,695","01:49:32,516","2 pounds Semtex, 500, 30 caliber ball bearings."
tt2381249,"01:49:32,541","01:49:36,265",Your friend is sitting on a highly sensitive - pressure trigger.
tt2381249,"01:49:36,290","01:49:39,086","So, no sudden moves."
tt2381249,"01:49:46,649","01:49:47,970",Your final test.
tt2381249,"01:49:47,995","01:49:52,526","When Lane has what he wants, I kill you and Benji."
tt2381249,"01:49:52,748","01:49:57,076","If not, everyone dies."
tt2381249,"01:49:59,278","01:50:03,521","No time to think, Ethan. Have a seat, please."
tt2381249,"01:50:17,844","01:50:21,611","Human nature, my weapon of choice."
tt2381249,"01:50:21,636","01:50:25,311","From the moment I killed the young lady in the record shop,"
tt2381249,"01:50:25,336","01:50:28,739",I knew you would stop at nothing to catch me.
tt2381249,"01:50:28,852","01:50:31,530",I also knew Ilsa wouldn't have a choice.
tt2381249,"01:50:31,555","01:50:35,283",Whether she broke you that night you met or let you go.
tt2381249,"01:50:35,308","01:50:40,671",Whether you let her run in Morocco. Whether she went to Atlee or not.
tt2381249,"01:50:40,702","01:50:45,497",You were certain we would end up where we are... right now.
tt2381249,"01:50:48,669","01:50:50,567",Then again.
tt2381249,"01:50:51,476","01:50:53,613",So was I.
tt2381249,"01:50:54,037","01:50:55,262","I know you, Lane."
tt2381249,"01:50:55,287","01:50:58,293",Somewhere along the line you had a crisis of faith.
tt2381249,"01:50:58,318","01:51:02,191","Human life didn't matter anymore, or maybe it never really did."
tt2381249,"01:51:02,216","01:51:08,363","Either way, you killed too many innocent people without ever asking who is giving the orders."
tt2381249,"01:51:08,388","01:51:09,760",Or why.
tt2381249,"01:51:09,785","01:51:11,973",You blame the system for what you are.
tt2381249,"01:51:11,998","01:51:14,348",Instead of yourself.
tt2381249,"01:51:14,373","01:51:16,375",You wanted revenge.
tt2381249,"01:51:16,400","01:51:18,359",But Rome wasn't destroyed in a day.
tt2381249,"01:51:18,384","01:51:22,218","You needed help, you needed the money. A lot of it."
tt2381249,"01:51:22,250","01:51:25,464",And you'll stop at nothing to get it.
tt2381249,"01:51:25,489","01:51:29,428",That's how I know I'm going to put you in a box.
tt2381249,"01:51:30,610","01:51:34,958",- Where is the disk? - Where is the disk?
tt2381249,"01:51:34,983","01:51:38,858",You like to play games. I've a game for you.
tt2381249,"01:51:38,990","01:51:43,652",I'll give you 50 million dollars
tt2381249,"01:51:44,272","01:51:46,904",to let Benji go.
tt2381249,"01:52:02,405","01:52:07,381",- Where is the disk? - Where is the disk?
tt2381249,"01:52:07,406","01:52:10,225",You're looking at it. I am the disk.
tt2381249,"01:52:10,250","01:52:13,871",I memorized it all 2.4 billion in number accounts.
tt2381249,"01:52:13,896","01:52:17,476","If that vest goes off, you get nothing. Without this money, you are nothing."
tt2381249,"01:52:17,501","01:52:21,282","Without me, you are nothing."
tt2381249,"01:52:25,434","01:52:29,315","Right now, you're thinking it's bluff. I'd never let my friends die."
tt2381249,"01:52:29,340","01:52:32,619",I couldn't possibly memorize the entire disk.
tt2381249,"01:52:32,644","01:52:35,225",There's only one way to be sure.
tt2381249,"01:52:36,061","01:52:38,206",Let Benji go
tt2381249,"01:52:55,385","01:52:57,295",Take him.
tt2381249,"01:53:00,489","01:53:03,466","They come 1 step closer, shoot me."
tt2381249,"01:53:04,762","01:53:06,432",Stop.
tt2381249,"01:53:09,287","01:53:12,241","You remember I told you, one day you were going to take things too far?"
tt2381249,"01:53:12,266","01:53:14,094","This is me speaking, by the way. It's not him."
tt2381249,"01:53:14,119","01:53:19,056","The only way this ends is you and me, Lane, face to face."
tt2381249,"01:53:19,081","01:53:22,088",Only this time I won't be locked in a glass box.
tt2381249,"01:53:22,113","01:53:23,430",You want your money.
tt2381249,"01:53:23,455","01:53:26,868",The bone doctor gonna beat it out of me.
tt2381249,"01:53:26,893","01:53:30,429",Now let Benji go
tt2381249,"01:53:34,461","01:53:37,506",1... 3... 9
tt2381249,"01:53:57,638","01:53:58,940",Go.
tt2381249,"01:53:58,965","01:54:02,001","- Ethan. - Brandt has you waiting, go."
tt2381249,"01:54:09,934","01:54:13,092",- What do I do? - Kill the woman.
tt2381249,"01:54:14,186","01:54:16,465",I need Hunt alive.
tt2381249,"01:55:03,558","01:55:05,391","- Go! - It's Benji, where am I going?"
tt2381249,"01:55:05,416","01:55:07,136",- They're coming. - We're not ready.
tt2381249,"01:55:07,161","01:55:09,139",Then get ready.
tt2381249,"01:55:34,882","01:55:36,525",Which way?
tt2381249,"01:59:55,955","02:00:00,717","Face to face. Just as you wish, Ethan"
tt2381249,"02:00:22,935","02:00:25,226","It hurts, I know."
tt2381249,"02:00:26,705","02:00:30,232","Gentlemen, this is Solomon Lane."
tt2381249,"02:00:30,652","02:00:32,753",Mr. Lane.
tt2381249,"02:00:33,647","02:00:36,506",Meet the IMF.
tt2381249,"02:01:55,077","02:01:57,175",You're free now.
tt2381249,"02:01:59,418","02:02:01,531",Where will you go?
tt2381249,"02:02:02,360","02:02:04,389",I don't know.
tt2381249,"02:02:06,349","02:02:08,682",I've done my part.
tt2381249,"02:02:08,707","02:02:10,358",Yeah.
tt2381249,"02:02:15,427","02:02:17,695","Ethan, we got to go."
tt2381249,"02:02:26,569","02:02:28,910",You better hurry now.
tt2381249,"02:02:30,503","02:02:32,528",Good luck.
tt2381249,"02:02:46,850","02:02:49,345",You know how to find me.
tt2381249,"02:03:06,385","02:03:08,292",Director Hunley.
tt2381249,"02:03:09,861","02:03:12,944",- Director Hunley . - Ah... Mr. Chairman.
tt2381249,"02:03:12,969","02:03:17,864","6 months ago, you stood before this panel and demanded that the IMF be dissolved."
tt2381249,"02:03:17,889","02:03:19,529","That is correct, sir."
tt2381249,"02:03:19,554","02:03:21,573",And how do you explain your testimony today?
tt2381249,"02:03:21,598","02:03:23,829",It's quite simple really. We had reason to believe
tt2381249,"02:03:23,854","02:03:27,382",that the Syndicate have infiltrated our government at the highest level.
tt2381249,"02:03:27,407","02:03:32,835","In order for our Mn to infiltrate that organization, his cover had to be absolute."
tt2381249,"02:03:32,860","02:03:37,269",The whole operation was known only to myself and a handful of IMF agents.
tt2381249,"02:03:37,294","02:03:42,435","So, the shuttering of the IMF was all part of an elaborate scheme."
tt2381249,"02:03:42,460","02:03:45,812","- To expose this so call Syndicate? - That is correct, sir."
tt2381249,"02:03:45,837","02:03:51,308","Which is why you're here today, asking for the IMF to be reinstated."
tt2381249,"02:03:51,333","02:03:53,616","That is correct, sir."
tt2381249,"02:03:55,498","02:03:59,067","I'm not sure the Committee approves of your methods, Director Hunley."
tt2381249,"02:03:59,092","02:04:03,659","Desperate times, desperate measures, Mr. Chairman."
tt2381249,"02:04:04,298","02:04:06,134","And you, Mr. Brandt."
tt2381249,"02:04:06,159","02:04:09,608",How can you justify this deception?
tt2381249,"02:04:10,471","02:04:13,866",I can neither confirm nor deny details of any operation
tt2381249,"02:04:13,891","02:04:16,568",without the Secretary's approval.
tt2381249,"02:04:23,960","02:04:26,142",Welcome to the IMF.
tt2381249,"02:04:26,409","02:04:28,729",Mr. Secretary
tt2381249,"02:04:30,468","02:04:34,984","Subtitle created by <font color=""#ffff00"">- Aorion -</font>"
tt3501632,"00:00:46,553","00:00:48,396","Now I know what you're thinking. ""Oh, no!"""
tt3501632,"00:00:48,433","00:00:52,258","""Thor's in a cage. How did this happen?"" Well, sometimes,"
tt3501632,"00:00:52,260","00:00:56,445",you have to get captured just to get a straight answer out of someone.
tt3501632,"00:00:57,210","00:01:01,227","Long story, basically I'm a bit of a hero."
tt3501632,"00:01:01,369","00:01:04,236","See, I spent some time on Earth."
tt3501632,"00:01:04,238","00:01:10,112","Fought some robots, saved the planet a couple of times. Then I went searching thru the cosmos for some..."
tt3501632,"00:01:10,144","00:01:13,079","Magic, colorful ""Infinity Stone"" things."
tt3501632,"00:01:13,080","00:01:15,049",Couldn't find any.
tt3501632,"00:01:15,224","00:01:18,026","That's when I came across the path of death,"
tt3501632,"00:01:18,062","00:01:19,174",and destruction.
tt3501632,"00:01:19,182","00:01:23,932","Which led me all the way here, into this cage..."
tt3501632,"00:01:24,000","00:01:26,104",Where I met you.
tt3501632,"00:01:31,064","00:01:33,930",How much longer do you think we'd be here?
tt3501632,"00:01:46,864","00:01:50,657","Thor, son of Odin."
tt3501632,"00:01:50,858","00:01:55,763",Surtur! You're still alive.
tt3501632,"00:01:55,808","00:01:58,506","I thought my father killed you. Like,"
tt3501632,"00:01:58,544","00:01:59,760",half a million years ago.
tt3501632,"00:01:59,765","00:02:01,647",I cannot die.
tt3501632,"00:02:01,681","00:02:05,664",Not until I fulfill my destiny and lay waste to your home.
tt3501632,"00:02:05,675","00:02:10,386","It's funny you should mention that, because I've been having these terrible dreams of late."
tt3501632,"00:02:10,390","00:02:15,429","Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins, and you, Surtur, in the center of all of them."
tt3501632,"00:02:15,469","00:02:17,540",Then you can see Ragnarok.
tt3501632,"00:02:17,583","00:02:20,520",The fall of Asgard.
tt3501632,"00:02:20,522","00:02:23,322",- The great prophecy... - Hang on! Hang on.
tt3501632,"00:02:24,277","00:02:27,240",I'll be back around shortly.
tt3501632,"00:02:27,285","00:02:30,241",I really feel like we were connecting there.
tt3501632,"00:02:32,364","00:02:36,154","Okay, so, Ragnarok. Tell me about that."
tt3501632,"00:02:36,158","00:02:41,231",My time has come. When my crown is reunited with the Eternal Flame...
tt3501632,"00:02:41,272","00:02:46,177",I shall be restored to my full might. I will tower over the mountains...
tt3501632,"00:02:46,188","00:02:49,145",And bury my sword deep in Asgard...
tt3501632,"00:02:49,190","00:02:50,147",Hang on.
tt3501632,"00:02:50,148","00:02:52,060",Give it a second.
tt3501632,"00:02:52,062","00:02:55,019","I swear, I'm not even moving. It's just doing this on its own."
tt3501632,"00:02:55,030","00:02:56,978",Everytime...
tt3501632,"00:02:56,978","00:03:00,003","Okay, so let me get this straight."
tt3501632,"00:03:00,045","00:03:05,782","You're gonna put your crown, in the Eternal Flame, and then you suddenly grow as big as a house?"
tt3501632,"00:03:05,786","00:03:06,834",A mountain!
tt3501632,"00:03:06,876","00:03:09,935",The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard?
tt3501632,"00:03:09,943","00:03:12,881",Odin is not on Asgard.
tt3501632,"00:03:12,915","00:03:16,636",And your absence has left the throne defenseless.
tt3501632,"00:03:16,641","00:03:18,711","Okay, so where is it? This crown?"
tt3501632,"00:03:18,754","00:03:22,546",This is my crown. The source of my power.
tt3501632,"00:03:22,549","00:03:25,607","Oh, that's a crown? I thought it was a big eyebrow."
tt3501632,"00:03:25,648","00:03:27,494",It's a crown.
tt3501632,"00:03:27,530","00:03:33,525","Anyway, It sounds like to stop Ragnarok, I just rip that thing off your head?"
tt3501632,"00:03:33,700","00:03:36,568",But Ragnarok has already begun.
tt3501632,"00:03:36,569","00:03:39,507",You cannot stop it.
tt3501632,"00:03:48,284","00:03:49,497",I am Asgard's doom.
tt3501632,"00:03:49,502","00:03:55,173",And so are you. All will suffer. All will burn!
tt3501632,"00:03:55,213","00:03:56,392",That's intense.
tt3501632,"00:03:56,432","00:04:02,136","To be honest, seeing you grow really big and set fire to a planet would be quite a spectacle."
tt3501632,"00:04:02,142","00:04:06,088","But it looks like I'm gonna have to choose option B, where I bust out of these chains..."
tt3501632,"00:04:06,132","00:04:10,081","Knock that tiara off your head, and stash it away in Asgard's vault."
tt3501632,"00:04:10,127","00:04:13,118",You can not stop Ragnarok.
tt3501632,"00:04:13,128","00:04:14,208",Why fight it?
tt3501632,"00:04:14,217","00:04:18,963","Because, that's what heroes do."
tt3501632,"00:04:22,994","00:04:25,951","Wait, I'm sorry. I didn't time that right."
tt3501632,"00:04:26,985","00:04:29,054",And now!
tt3501632,"00:04:32,857","00:04:36,715","You have made a grave mistake, Odinson."
tt3501632,"00:04:36,751","00:04:39,811",I make grave mistakes all the time.
tt3501632,"00:04:40,776","00:04:44,668",Everything seems to work out.
tt3501632,"00:06:01,433","00:06:02,841","Heimdall, I know it's been a while..."
tt3501632,"00:06:02,866","00:06:05,734",but I could really use a fast exit!
tt3501632,"00:06:06,722","00:06:07,871",Heimdall?
tt3501632,"00:06:08,835","00:06:10,804",Heimdall was an idiot.
tt3501632,"00:06:10,815","00:06:13,719",This job should've made him rich.
tt3501632,"00:06:13,752","00:06:17,610","The job ain't easy, but it does have its benefits."
tt3501632,"00:06:17,644","00:06:21,662",The Bifrost gives me access to everything the Nine Realms has to offer.
tt3501632,"00:06:21,672","00:06:24,730",I mean it's all mine for the taking.
tt3501632,"00:06:25,597","00:06:27,699",Behold...
tt3501632,"00:06:28,732","00:06:30,678",My stuff.
tt3501632,"00:06:31,701","00:06:37,471",I'm particularly fond of these. I pulled them out of a place in Midgard called Tehk-Sas.
tt3501632,"00:06:37,507","00:06:41,457",I even named them Des and Troy.
tt3501632,"00:06:41,467","00:06:44,461","You see, when you put them together..."
tt3501632,"00:06:44,504","00:06:47,233",They destroy.
tt3501632,"00:07:04,333","00:07:07,166",Heimdall? Come on.
tt3501632,"00:07:26,042","00:07:27,920",Stay!
tt3501632,"00:07:29,011","00:07:30,789",Heimdall?
tt3501632,"00:07:30,826","00:07:32,829",I'm running short of options.
tt3501632,"00:07:32,840","00:07:34,717",Heimdalll?
tt3501632,"00:07:35,775","00:07:37,720",Skurge...
tt3501632,"00:07:39,734","00:07:41,769",Is that important?
tt3501632,"00:07:47,817","00:07:50,721",You girls are in for a treat.
tt3501632,"00:08:42,092","00:08:43,972",Girls!
tt3501632,"00:08:44,931","00:08:46,934","Well, well, well."
tt3501632,"00:08:46,976","00:08:49,045",Look who decided to pop in.
tt3501632,"00:08:49,054","00:08:50,931",Thanks for scaring away my company
tt3501632,"00:08:50,934","00:08:52,902",and drenching the workplace with brains.
tt3501632,"00:08:52,946","00:08:53,903",Who are you?
tt3501632,"00:08:53,903","00:08:54,950",Don't you remember?
tt3501632,"00:08:54,991","00:08:56,994","I'm Skurge, we've fought together"
tt3501632,"00:08:57,039","00:08:58,882",- on Vanaheim. - Right.
tt3501632,"00:08:58,919","00:08:59,932",Where is Heimdall?
tt3501632,"00:08:59,943","00:09:02,968","That traitor? Well, no one knows. He's a fugitive of the throne."
tt3501632,"00:09:02,978","00:09:04,103",Traitor?
tt3501632,"00:09:04,199","00:09:09,459","See, Odin charged Heimdall with negligence of duty but disappeared before the trial."
tt3501632,"00:09:09,871","00:09:11,842",Hard to catch a guy who can see everything.
tt3501632,"00:09:11,885","00:09:15,676",Hold on. I'm supposed to announce your arrival.
tt3501632,"00:09:39,304","00:09:41,372",What the hell is that?
tt3501632,"00:09:48,376","00:09:51,335","Oh, Brother..."
tt3501632,"00:09:51,346","00:09:53,314",This is it.
tt3501632,"00:09:53,359","00:09:56,160",- I take my leave. - You fool!
tt3501632,"00:09:56,163","00:09:58,165",- You didn't listen. - I'm sorry.
tt3501632,"00:09:58,176","00:10:00,055","- Lady Sif, get help! - Somebody, help!"
tt3501632,"00:10:00,090","00:10:02,125",I'm sorry for all I've done.
tt3501632,"00:10:02,166","00:10:04,012",Shhh.
tt3501632,"00:10:04,015","00:10:07,007",- It's all right. Hold on. - I'm sorry.
tt3501632,"00:10:07,050","00:10:08,874",I tried to rule Earth.
tt3501632,"00:10:08,937","00:10:12,190",- They'd be lucky to have you. - I'm sorry about that thing with the Tesseract.
tt3501632,"00:10:12,199","00:10:14,042",I just couldn't help myself.
tt3501632,"00:10:14,046","00:10:17,077","- I'm a trickster. - Yes, so mischievious."
tt3501632,"00:10:17,157","00:10:19,884",Sorry when I turned you to a frog.
tt3501632,"00:10:19,885","00:10:21,200",It was a wonderful joke.
tt3501632,"00:10:21,311","00:10:23,957",It was indeed hilarious.
tt3501632,"00:10:24,121","00:10:26,400",You are the saviour of Asgard.
tt3501632,"00:10:26,495","00:10:29,260",Tell my story. Build a statue for me.
tt3501632,"00:10:29,375","00:10:31,602",We will build a big statue for you.
tt3501632,"00:10:31,732","00:10:35,048","With my helmet on. With the big, bendy horns."
tt3501632,"00:10:35,467","00:10:37,954",I will tell father what you did here today.
tt3501632,"00:10:38,034","00:10:40,018",I didn't do it for him.
tt3501632,"00:10:40,140","00:10:42,108",I didn't do it...
tt3501632,"00:10:42,156","00:10:43,718",for him.
tt3501632,"00:10:50,767","00:10:56,640",No!
tt3501632,"00:10:57,896","00:11:00,772","And so, Loki died of his wounds."
tt3501632,"00:11:00,797","00:11:03,092",Giving his life for ours.
tt3501632,"00:11:03,124","00:11:05,412",He fought back those disgusting elves.
tt3501632,"00:11:05,459","00:11:08,159",He brought peace to the realm.
tt3501632,"00:11:08,189","00:11:09,845","Loki, my boy..."
tt3501632,"00:11:09,910","00:11:12,619","T'was many moons ago, when I found you on that..."
tt3501632,"00:11:12,644","00:11:14,810",Frostbitten battlefield.
tt3501632,"00:11:14,835","00:11:19,611","On that day, I did not yet see in you, Asgard's savior."
tt3501632,"00:11:19,652","00:11:24,623","No. You were merely, a little blue baby"
tt3501632,"00:11:24,665","00:11:29,181","icicle that melted, this old fool's heart."
tt3501632,"00:11:30,472","00:11:33,488",Bravo. Bravo.
tt3501632,"00:11:37,159","00:11:39,003",Father.
tt3501632,"00:11:39,201","00:11:41,012","Oh, shit."
tt3501632,"00:11:41,016","00:11:44,998","My son, Thor, has returned! Greetings, my boy."
tt3501632,"00:11:45,868","00:11:47,975",That's an interesting play. What's it called?
tt3501632,"00:11:47,995","00:11:49,968",The tragedy of Loki of Asgard.
tt3501632,"00:11:49,993","00:11:52,029",People wanted to commemmorate him.
tt3501632,"00:11:52,040","00:11:54,974","And indeed they should. Oh, I like the statue."
tt3501632,"00:11:55,008","00:12:00,710","Looked better-looking than him when he was alive. A little less weasely, less greasy maybe."
tt3501632,"00:12:00,813","00:12:02,950",You know what this is?
tt3501632,"00:12:02,957","00:12:05,894","Oh, the skull of Surtur. That's a formidable weapon."
tt3501632,"00:12:05,927","00:12:11,800",Do me a favor. Lock this away in the vault so it doesn't destroy the planet.
tt3501632,"00:12:12,657","00:12:13,670","Thank you, dear."
tt3501632,"00:12:13,715","00:12:17,541","Um, so, it's back to Midgard for you, is it?"
tt3501632,"00:12:17,542","00:12:18,688",Nope.
tt3501632,"00:12:18,695","00:12:21,631",You know I've been having this recurring dream lately.
tt3501632,"00:12:21,632","00:12:24,611",Every night I'd see Asgard falling to ruins.
tt3501632,"00:12:24,636","00:12:28,494",That's just a silly dream. Signs of an overactive imagination.
tt3501632,"00:12:28,495","00:12:29,452",Possibly.
tt3501632,"00:12:29,453","00:12:31,422",But then I decided to go out there and investigate.
tt3501632,"00:12:31,433","00:12:35,449","And what do I find, but the 9 Realms completely in chaos."
tt3501632,"00:12:35,490","00:12:39,472","Enemies of Asgard assembling. Plotting our demise, all while you,"
tt3501632,"00:12:39,482","00:12:44,365","Odin, the protector of those 9 Realms, are sitting here in your bathrobe, eating grapes."
tt3501632,"00:12:44,400","00:12:47,165","Yes, well it is best to respect our neighbor's freedom."
tt3501632,"00:12:47,171","00:12:48,149","Yes, of course."
tt3501632,"00:12:48,193","00:12:50,431",The freedom to be massacred.
tt3501632,"00:12:51,529","00:12:53,682","Yes, besides I've been rather busy myself..."
tt3501632,"00:12:53,707","00:12:57,897","- Watching theater? - No. Board meetings, security council meetings..."
tt3501632,"00:12:57,922","00:12:59,263",You're gonna really make me do it?
tt3501632,"00:12:59,288","00:13:00,492",Do what?
tt3501632,"00:13:03,173","00:13:07,144",You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir as it returns to my hand...
tt3501632,"00:13:07,169","00:13:08,339",Not even your face.
tt3501632,"00:13:08,376","00:13:10,118",You've gone quite mad.
tt3501632,"00:13:10,143","00:13:11,630",You will be executed for this.
tt3501632,"00:13:11,655","00:13:14,467","Then I'll see you on the other side, brother."
tt3501632,"00:13:14,981","00:13:17,044",All right. I yield!
tt3501632,"00:13:25,873","00:13:27,841",Behold!
tt3501632,"00:13:27,982","00:13:30,819",Thor Odinson.
tt3501632,"00:13:30,852","00:13:32,697",No.
tt3501632,"00:13:33,725","00:13:34,769",You had one job.
tt3501632,"00:13:34,812","00:13:36,658",Just the one!
tt3501632,"00:13:37,650","00:13:38,630",Where is Odin?
tt3501632,"00:13:38,643","00:13:40,587","You just couldn't stay away, could you?"
tt3501632,"00:13:40,620","00:13:42,622",Everything was fine without you.
tt3501632,"00:13:42,663","00:13:45,689",Asgard was prospering. You've ruined everything.
tt3501632,"00:13:45,700","00:13:47,722",- Ask them... - Where's Father? You kill him?
tt3501632,"00:13:47,748","00:13:50,800",You had what you wanted. You had the independence you asked for.
tt3501632,"00:13:50,871","00:13:53,779","Okay, I know exactly where he is."
tt3501632,"00:14:05,299","00:14:07,512",I swear I left him right here.
tt3501632,"00:14:09,005","00:14:11,496","Here on the sidewalk, or that building being demolished?"
tt3501632,"00:14:11,502","00:14:13,447",- Great planning. - How was I supposed to know?
tt3501632,"00:14:13,480","00:14:15,326",I can't see into the future. I'm not a witch.
tt3501632,"00:14:15,328","00:14:18,165",Really? Why did you dress like one?
tt3501632,"00:14:18,199","00:14:20,144",- Hey! - I can't believe you're alive.
tt3501632,"00:14:20,144","00:14:21,293",I saw you die.
tt3501632,"00:14:21,334","00:14:23,211","I mourned you, I cried for you."
tt3501632,"00:14:23,244","00:14:25,194",I'm honored.
tt3501632,"00:14:26,012","00:14:27,926","Hi, would you mind taking a picture with us?"
tt3501632,"00:14:27,951","00:14:29,653","Oh, sure."
tt3501632,"00:14:30,111","00:14:32,180",Start figuring out where he is.
tt3501632,"00:14:33,146","00:14:35,333",Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.
tt3501632,"00:14:35,885","00:14:37,985","She didn't dump me, though."
tt3501632,"00:14:37,996","00:14:40,987",I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping.
tt3501632,"00:14:42,761","00:14:44,324",What's this? What are you doing?
tt3501632,"00:14:44,349","00:14:46,023",This isn't me.
tt3501632,"00:14:49,082","00:14:50,925",Loki?
tt3501632,"00:15:15,020","00:15:17,823",Thor Odinson.
tt3501632,"00:15:27,764","00:15:29,733",God of Thunder.
tt3501632,"00:15:29,798","00:15:32,664",You can put down the umbrella.
tt3501632,"00:15:49,498","00:15:52,550",So Earth has wizards now?
tt3501632,"00:15:57,216","00:16:01,161",I prefer the term Master of the Mystic Arts. You can leave that now.
tt3501632,"00:16:01,173","00:16:02,985","All right, wizard."
tt3501632,"00:16:03,021","00:16:04,933",Who are you and why should I care?
tt3501632,"00:16:04,968","00:16:09,019","My name is Dr. Stephen Strange, and I have some questions for you."
tt3501632,"00:16:09,027","00:16:10,973",Take a seat.
tt3501632,"00:16:14,896","00:16:16,010",Tea?
tt3501632,"00:16:18,432","00:16:20,210",I don't drink tea.
tt3501632,"00:16:20,251","00:16:21,300",What do you drink?
tt3501632,"00:16:21,334","00:16:23,273",Not tea.
tt3501632,"00:16:25,726","00:16:30,859",So I keep a watchlist of individuals from other realms that may be a threat to this world.
tt3501632,"00:16:30,884","00:16:34,800","Your adoptive brother, Loki, is one of those beings."
tt3501632,"00:16:34,825","00:16:37,002",That's a worthy inclusion...
tt3501632,"00:16:38,859","00:16:40,771",Why bring him here?
tt3501632,"00:16:40,796","00:16:42,708",We're looking for my father.
tt3501632,"00:16:42,733","00:16:46,493",So if I were to tell you where Odin was...
tt3501632,"00:16:46,518","00:16:48,552",You all return to Asgard?
tt3501632,"00:16:48,577","00:16:49,609",Promptly.
tt3501632,"00:16:49,634","00:16:51,636",Great. Then I'll help you.
tt3501632,"00:16:51,661","00:16:54,496","If you knew where he was, why didn't you call me?"
tt3501632,"00:16:54,522","00:17:00,485",I have to tell you that he was adamant to not be disturbed. He said he had chosen to remain in exile.
tt3501632,"00:17:00,528","00:17:03,330",And you don't have a phone.
tt3501632,"00:17:03,366","00:17:08,215","No, I don't have a phone, but you could have sent an electronic letter."
tt3501632,"00:17:08,217","00:17:09,531",- Called an e-mail? - Yeah. Do you have a computer?
tt3501632,"00:17:09,571","00:17:11,237",No. What for?
tt3501632,"00:17:11,284","00:17:16,358","Anyway, my father is no longer in exile, so if you could tell me where he is,"
tt3501632,"00:17:16,398","00:17:19,528",- I can take him home. - Gladly. He is in Norway.
tt3501632,"00:17:20,194","00:17:25,770",Let's see whether this incantation requires any Asgardian modifications...
tt3501632,"00:17:25,992","00:17:27,411",Nope.
tt3501632,"00:17:34,150","00:17:37,051",Can you stop... doing that?
tt3501632,"00:17:37,052","00:17:40,911",Can I... I need one strand of your hair.
tt3501632,"00:17:40,914","00:17:44,072",Let me explain something. My hair is not to be meddled with.
tt3501632,"00:17:51,964","00:17:53,912",We could've just walked.
tt3501632,"00:17:55,958","00:17:57,872",He is waiting for you.
tt3501632,"00:17:57,873","00:17:59,648",All right.
tt3501632,"00:17:59,685","00:18:01,379","Oh, don't forget your umbrella."
tt3501632,"00:18:01,434","00:18:02,821","Oh, yes."
tt3501632,"00:18:08,695","00:18:11,720",Sorry...
tt3501632,"00:18:16,339","00:18:18,785",I suppose I need my brother back?
tt3501632,"00:18:18,834","00:18:20,470","Oh yeah, right."
tt3501632,"00:18:25,454","00:18:29,313","I have been falling, for 30 minutes!"
tt3501632,"00:18:29,481","00:18:31,323",You can handle him from here.
tt3501632,"00:18:31,362","00:18:32,406","Yes, yes."
tt3501632,"00:18:32,415","00:18:34,261",Thank you very much for your help.
tt3501632,"00:18:34,299","00:18:37,422",- Good luck. - Handle me? Who are you?
tt3501632,"00:18:38,223","00:18:40,681",- Loki... - You think you're some kind of sorcerer?
tt3501632,"00:18:40,706","00:18:42,380","Don't think for one minute, you second-rate..."
tt3501632,"00:18:42,429","00:18:43,752",All right. Bye-bye!
tt3501632,"00:19:08,405","00:19:10,023",Father.
tt3501632,"00:19:11,297","00:19:12,699",Look at this place.
tt3501632,"00:19:12,754","00:19:14,444",It's beautiful.
tt3501632,"00:19:19,166","00:19:21,134","Father, it's us."
tt3501632,"00:19:24,114","00:19:25,794",My sons.
tt3501632,"00:19:26,058","00:19:28,113",I've been waiting for you.
tt3501632,"00:19:28,145","00:19:30,232",I know. We've come to take you home.
tt3501632,"00:19:30,288","00:19:32,016",Home? Yes.
tt3501632,"00:19:32,795","00:19:36,552",Your mother. She calls me.
tt3501632,"00:19:37,711","00:19:39,659",Can you hear it?
tt3501632,"00:19:40,759","00:19:42,827","Loki, lift your magic."
tt3501632,"00:19:44,641","00:19:47,508",It took me quite a while to break free from your spell.
tt3501632,"00:19:47,509","00:19:49,458",Frigga would've been proud.
tt3501632,"00:19:49,458","00:19:52,395","Come sit with me, I don't have much time."
tt3501632,"00:19:58,366","00:20:02,257","I know we've failed you, but we can make this right."
tt3501632,"00:20:02,292","00:20:03,539",I failed you..
tt3501632,"00:20:04,273","00:20:06,217",It is upon us.
tt3501632,"00:20:06,218","00:20:07,264",Ragnarok.
tt3501632,"00:20:07,307","00:20:10,902","No, I've stopped Ragnarok, I've put an end to Surtur."
tt3501632,"00:20:10,951","00:20:14,736","No, it's already begun. She's coming."
tt3501632,"00:20:16,310","00:20:20,128","My life has all but held her back, but my time has come."
tt3501632,"00:20:21,234","00:20:23,175",I can not keep her waiting any longer.
tt3501632,"00:20:23,209","00:20:26,011",Father .. Who are you talking about?
tt3501632,"00:20:26,013","00:20:28,066",Goddess of Death.
tt3501632,"00:20:28,091","00:20:29,445",Hela.
tt3501632,"00:20:29,477","00:20:34,031",My firstborn. Your sister.
tt3501632,"00:20:36,143","00:20:38,055",What?
tt3501632,"00:20:40,101","00:20:43,995",Her violent appetites grew beyond my control.
tt3501632,"00:20:44,062","00:20:49,730","Couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her."
tt3501632,"00:20:49,835","00:20:53,785",Locked her away. She draws her strength from Asgard.
tt3501632,"00:20:53,895","00:20:57,842","When she gets there, her powers will be limitless."
tt3501632,"00:20:57,886","00:21:00,823","Whatever she is, we can stop her together."
tt3501632,"00:21:00,856","00:21:02,732","No, we won't."
tt3501632,"00:21:02,735","00:21:05,125",I'm on a different path now.
tt3501632,"00:21:05,173","00:21:07,803",This you must face alone.
tt3501632,"00:21:08,741","00:21:11,543","I love you, my sons."
tt3501632,"00:21:13,459","00:21:14,606",Look at that.
tt3501632,"00:21:20,659","00:21:24,198",Remember this place. Home.
tt3501632,"00:22:02,571","00:22:04,531",Brother.
tt3501632,"00:22:11,870","00:22:15,177",This was your doing.
tt3501632,"00:22:57,071","00:22:59,095",So he's gone?
tt3501632,"00:23:01,415","00:23:05,065",A shame. I would've like to have seen that.
tt3501632,"00:23:05,423","00:23:07,694",You must be Hela.
tt3501632,"00:23:07,782","00:23:09,957",I'm Thor. Son of Odin.
tt3501632,"00:23:09,997","00:23:11,065",Really?
tt3501632,"00:23:11,161","00:23:13,266",You don't look like him.
tt3501632,"00:23:13,330","00:23:15,696",Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.
tt3501632,"00:23:15,775","00:23:17,607",You sound like him.
tt3501632,"00:23:19,224","00:23:20,920",Kneel.
tt3501632,"00:23:21,016","00:23:23,032",Beg your pardon?
tt3501632,"00:23:24,976","00:23:26,188",Kneel.
tt3501632,"00:23:31,164","00:23:33,179",For your queen.
tt3501632,"00:23:33,999","00:23:35,776",I don't think so.
tt3501632,"00:23:46,042","00:23:47,891",That's not possible.
tt3501632,"00:23:49,293","00:23:53,324","Darling, you have no idea what's possible."
tt3501632,"00:24:13,138","00:24:16,042",- Bring us back! - No!
tt3501632,"00:24:23,880","00:24:25,758",Loki!
tt3501632,"00:25:10,918","00:25:13,854",Who are you? What have you done with Thor?
tt3501632,"00:25:17,383","00:25:19,297",I'm Hela.
tt3501632,"00:25:20,435","00:25:22,470",I'm just a janitor.
tt3501632,"00:25:24,153","00:25:28,626",You look like a smart boy with good survival instincts.
tt3501632,"00:25:30,329","00:25:33,130",How would you like a job?
tt3501632,"00:27:40,704","00:27:44,648",Are you a fighter? Or are you food?
tt3501632,"00:27:45,060","00:27:47,546",I'm just passing through.
tt3501632,"00:27:47,610","00:27:50,295",It is food! On your knees.
tt3501632,"00:28:31,715","00:28:33,594",He's mine.
tt3501632,"00:28:42,504","00:28:44,382",Wait.
tt3501632,"00:28:52,336","00:28:53,449",Wait.
tt3501632,"00:28:55,471","00:29:00,320","He's mine. So if you want him, you go through me."
tt3501632,"00:29:00,321","00:29:02,598",But we've already got him.
tt3501632,"00:29:03,323","00:29:06,384",All right then. I guess I go through you.
tt3501632,"00:29:06,391","00:29:08,303",More food.
tt3501632,"00:29:43,740","00:29:44,921",Thank you.
tt3501632,"00:30:19,373","00:30:23,322","Scrapper 142, I need clearance and an audience with boss."
tt3501632,"00:30:23,367","00:30:25,278",I've got someone special.
tt3501632,"00:30:25,313","00:30:28,247","Hey, where are you taking me?"
tt3501632,"00:30:29,204","00:30:30,319",Answer me!
tt3501632,"00:30:30,362","00:30:35,265","Hey! I'm Thor, son of Odin. I need to get back to Asgard."
tt3501632,"00:30:35,308","00:30:38,111","Many apologies, Your Majesty."
tt3501632,"00:31:05,893","00:31:09,809",It's come to my attention that you don't know who I am.
tt3501632,"00:31:16,651","00:31:19,846",I am Hela. Odin's firstborn.
tt3501632,"00:31:19,851","00:31:22,653",Commander of the Legions of Asgard.
tt3501632,"00:31:22,655","00:31:26,670",The rightful heir to the throne and the Goddess of Death.
tt3501632,"00:31:30,575","00:31:32,712",My father is dead.
tt3501632,"00:31:32,752","00:31:35,586",As are the princes. You're welcome.
tt3501632,"00:31:35,590","00:31:39,381",We were once the seat of absolute power in the cosmos.
tt3501632,"00:31:39,385","00:31:44,525",Our supremacy was unchallenged. Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.
tt3501632,"00:31:44,562","00:31:49,246",Our destiny is to rule over all others.
tt3501632,"00:31:49,283","00:31:53,231",And I'm here to restore that power.
tt3501632,"00:31:53,309","00:31:55,218",Kneel before me.
tt3501632,"00:31:55,253","00:31:59,438",And rise to the ranks of my great conquest.
tt3501632,"00:32:00,401","00:32:08,051","Whoever you are, whatever you've done. Surrender now, or we will show no mercy."
tt3501632,"00:32:08,090","00:32:12,139",Whoever I am? Did you listen to a word I've said?
tt3501632,"00:32:12,148","00:32:15,047",This is your last warning.
tt3501632,"00:32:16,140","00:32:19,099",I thought you'd be happy to see me.
tt3501632,"00:32:23,992","00:32:25,904",Fine.
tt3501632,"00:33:33,311","00:33:36,043",I missed this.
tt3501632,"00:33:36,081","00:33:38,085","Still, it's a shame."
tt3501632,"00:33:38,095","00:33:40,164",Good soldiers dying for nothing.
tt3501632,"00:33:40,208","00:33:42,976",All because they couldn't see the future.
tt3501632,"00:33:43,013","00:33:45,015",Sad.
tt3501632,"00:33:45,946","00:33:48,018",Still alive.
tt3501632,"00:33:54,923","00:33:56,867",Change of heart?
tt3501632,"00:33:56,902","00:33:59,962",Go back to whatever chamber you crept out of...
tt3501632,"00:33:59,970","00:34:02,840",You evil demoness!
tt3501632,"00:34:05,843","00:34:08,744",Let's go see my palace.
tt3501632,"00:34:38,409","00:34:40,510","Fear not, for you are found."
tt3501632,"00:34:42,498","00:34:45,435",You're home and there's no going back.
tt3501632,"00:34:47,348","00:34:49,351",No one leaves this place.
tt3501632,"00:34:49,394","00:34:51,464",But what is this place?
tt3501632,"00:34:51,474","00:34:53,441",The answer is ..
tt3501632,"00:34:54,180","00:34:56,147",Sakaar.
tt3501632,"00:34:57,147","00:34:59,185",Surrounded by cosmic gateways...
tt3501632,"00:34:59,195","00:35:02,153",Sakaar lives on the edge of the known and unknown.
tt3501632,"00:35:02,197","00:35:06,178",It is the collection point for all lost and unloved things.
tt3501632,"00:35:06,189","00:35:07,300",Like you.
tt3501632,"00:35:07,309","00:35:10,245","But here on Sakaar, you are significant."
tt3501632,"00:35:10,278","00:35:14,005","You are valuable, cared, and loved."
tt3501632,"00:35:14,008","00:35:18,091",- What the hell? - And no one loves you more than the Grandmaster.
tt3501632,"00:35:18,132","00:35:22,878","He's the original. The first lost, and the first found."
tt3501632,"00:35:22,882","00:35:26,966","The creator of Sakaar, and father of the Contest of Champions."
tt3501632,"00:35:27,007","00:35:31,756","For once you were nothing, now you are something."
tt3501632,"00:35:31,792","00:35:34,753",You are the property of the Grandmaster.
tt3501632,"00:35:34,796","00:35:39,934","Congratulations, you will meet the Grandmaster in 5 seconds."
tt3501632,"00:35:39,942","00:35:42,643",Prepare yourself.
tt3501632,"00:35:43,637","00:35:45,607",Prepare yourself.
tt3501632,"00:35:46,574","00:35:50,488","You are now meeting, the Grandmaster."
tt3501632,"00:36:02,445","00:36:06,459",- He's wonderful. It is a he? - It is a he.
tt3501632,"00:36:06,567","00:36:10,551","I love it when you come to visit, 142."
tt3501632,"00:36:10,561","00:36:18,352","You bring me just the best stuff. Whenever we get to talking, Topaz, about 142, what do I always say?"
tt3501632,"00:36:18,385","00:36:20,980","- She is the, starts with a B... - Trash."
tt3501632,"00:36:21,124","00:36:23,422",No. Not trash.
tt3501632,"00:36:23,913","00:36:26,239",Were you waiting to just call her that?
tt3501632,"00:36:26,245","00:36:28,841",- That doesnt start with a B. - Boozehead.
tt3501632,"00:36:29,777","00:36:34,160",I'm sorry. No. Best. I was thinking about best.
tt3501632,"00:36:34,166","00:36:35,426",'Cause I always say you're the best.
tt3501632,"00:36:35,431","00:36:37,394","She brought me my beloved champion, you know."
tt3501632,"00:36:37,428","00:36:40,388",- You say that everytime she's here. - What have you brought today?
tt3501632,"00:36:40,388","00:36:45,687",- A contender. - What? I need to go closer. I want a look at this.
tt3501632,"00:36:45,808","00:36:47,657",Can you take us closer? Thank you.
tt3501632,"00:36:59,674","00:37:01,478",Pay this lady.
tt3501632,"00:37:01,503","00:37:05,683",Just wait a damn minute. I'm not for sale.
tt3501632,"00:37:11,811","00:37:14,116","Man, he's a fighter."
tt3501632,"00:37:14,142","00:37:15,539",I'll take 10 million.
tt3501632,"00:37:15,565","00:37:19,102",- Tell her she's dreaming. - For heaven's sakes. Transfer the units.
tt3501632,"00:37:26,011","00:37:29,012",- You'll pay for this! - No. I got paid for this.
tt3501632,"00:37:29,896","00:37:32,081",Here's what I want to know.
tt3501632,"00:37:33,704","00:37:40,130",- Who are you? - I am the God of... Thunder!
tt3501632,"00:37:40,170","00:37:44,154","I didn't hear any thunder, but on your fingers..."
tt3501632,"00:37:44,198","00:37:47,011","Is that, like, sparkles?"
tt3501632,"00:37:47,052","00:37:50,248","- We've located your cousin. - Uh... Oh, good!"
tt3501632,"00:37:50,256","00:37:51,947","Yeah, come on."
tt3501632,"00:37:51,987","00:37:53,368",You're gonna like this.
tt3501632,"00:37:53,409","00:37:56,079","There he is. Hey, cuz."
tt3501632,"00:37:56,114","00:37:58,176",It's been fun. Where you been hiding?
tt3501632,"00:37:58,213","00:38:00,228",Hi.
tt3501632,"00:38:00,775","00:38:02,752",So...
tt3501632,"00:38:05,162","00:38:08,256",- Sorry. - Carlo...
tt3501632,"00:38:08,610","00:38:11,397",- I pardon you. - Thank you.
tt3501632,"00:38:12,169","00:38:16,661",You're officially pardoned... from life.
tt3501632,"00:38:22,420","00:38:26,407",Oh my God!
tt3501632,"00:38:26,777","00:38:29,707",I'm stepping in it! Look.
tt3501632,"00:38:29,842","00:38:32,788","- Oh, the smell. - Wow!"
tt3501632,"00:38:32,845","00:38:36,674",- What does it smell like? - Baked toast.
tt3501632,"00:38:37,188","00:38:40,869",What happened to my manners. I haven't properly introduced myself.
tt3501632,"00:38:40,895","00:38:43,002",Come on. Follow me.
tt3501632,"00:38:43,013","00:38:49,029",My name is Grandmaster. I preside over the Contest of Champions.
tt3501632,"00:38:49,073","00:38:52,832","Skip that part, why I don't participate in it and you, my friend..."
tt3501632,"00:38:52,857","00:38:55,830",Have just been part of the cast. What do you say to that?
tt3501632,"00:38:55,862","00:38:59,498",We're not friends and I don't give a shit about your games. I'm going back to Asgard.
tt3501632,"00:38:59,924","00:39:03,970","Ass-guard? 1, 2, 3, 4."
tt3501632,"00:39:07,371","00:39:10,928",I let go.
tt3501632,"00:39:11,873","00:39:14,857",Loki? Loki!
tt3501632,"00:39:14,902","00:39:17,259",Loki. Over here.
tt3501632,"00:39:17,605","00:39:19,036",Over here.
tt3501632,"00:39:19,544","00:39:21,137",Loki!
tt3501632,"00:39:21,214","00:39:23,931",What? You're alive?
tt3501632,"00:39:24,003","00:39:27,371","- Of course, I'm alive! What are you doing here? - What do you mean, what I'm doing?"
tt3501632,"00:39:27,403","00:39:29,708",I'm stuck in this stupid chair. Where's your chair?
tt3501632,"00:39:29,748","00:39:31,194",- I didn't get a chair. - Get me out of this one.
tt3501632,"00:39:31,219","00:39:32,867",- I can't. - Get me out!
tt3501632,"00:39:32,876","00:39:36,823",I didn't just come to this place without getting his favor.
tt3501632,"00:39:36,836","00:39:39,810","- Plus, I've been out here weeks ago. - Weeks ago?"
tt3501632,"00:39:39,835","00:39:41,963",- But I just got here. - What are you wispering about?
tt3501632,"00:39:41,963","00:39:44,945",I'm a hip dude around these parts.
tt3501632,"00:39:44,990","00:39:49,330","On any other world, I'll be like, millions of years old. But here on Sakaar..."
tt3501632,"00:39:52,714","00:39:55,802",In any case...
tt3501632,"00:39:55,845","00:39:58,264",You know this...
tt3501632,"00:39:58,337","00:40:01,970",- You call yourself Lord of Thunder? - God of Thunder. Tell him.
tt3501632,"00:40:02,073","00:40:04,028",I've never met this man in my life.
tt3501632,"00:40:04,085","00:40:05,802",- He's my brother! - Adopted.
tt3501632,"00:40:05,835","00:40:09,073",- Is he any kind of a fighter? - Take this thing off my neck. I'll show you.
tt3501632,"00:40:09,098","00:40:12,713","Listen to that. He's threatening me. Hey, Sparkles! Here's the deal."
tt3501632,"00:40:12,752","00:40:15,713","- You wanna get back to Ass-place,  Ass-berg... - Asgard!"
tt3501632,"00:40:15,713","00:40:19,861",Any contender who defeats my champion...
tt3501632,"00:40:19,908","00:40:22,455",- Their freedom they shall win. - Fine!
tt3501632,"00:40:22,480","00:40:25,788",Then point me in the direction of whoever's ass I have to kick.
tt3501632,"00:40:25,833","00:40:30,479","That's what I call contender! The direction would be this way, Lord."
tt3501632,"00:40:30,631","00:40:31,823",Loki!
tt3501632,"00:40:36,211","00:40:39,757","Hey! Hey! Hey, take it easy man."
tt3501632,"00:40:39,838","00:40:43,673",Over here. Pile of rocks waving at you.
tt3501632,"00:40:43,706","00:40:47,633","Naw, I'm actually a thing. I'm a being. Allow me to introduce myself..."
tt3501632,"00:40:47,635","00:40:50,791",My name is Korg. I'm kind of like the leader in here...
tt3501632,"00:40:50,832","00:40:53,814","I'm made of rocks, as you can see, but don't let that intimidate you."
tt3501632,"00:40:53,825","00:40:56,685",You don't need to be afraid unless you're made of scissors.
tt3501632,"00:40:56,690","00:41:02,611","Just a little rock, paper, scissor joke for you. This is my friend Miek."
tt3501632,"00:41:02,780","00:41:05,606",He's an insect and has knives for hands.
tt3501632,"00:41:05,608","00:41:08,456","- You're a Kronnan, aren't you? - That I am."
tt3501632,"00:41:08,511","00:41:10,344",How'd you end up in here?
tt3501632,"00:41:10,376","00:41:14,259","Well, I tried to start a revolution but didn't print enough pamphlets, so..."
tt3501632,"00:41:14,284","00:41:17,877",Hardly anyone turned up. Except for my mum and her boyfriend who I hate.
tt3501632,"00:41:17,909","00:41:23,439","As punishment, I was forced to be in here and be a gladiator. Bit of a promotional disaster, that one."
tt3501632,"00:41:23,484","00:41:29,717",But I'm actually organizing another revolution. Do you reckon you'd be interested?
tt3501632,"00:41:31,743","00:41:33,502",How did you...
tt3501632,"00:41:33,536","00:41:36,589","Yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle."
tt3501632,"00:41:36,630","00:41:39,559",But not a real circle. More like a freaky circle.
tt3501632,"00:41:39,560","00:41:42,577","- This doesn't make any sense. - No, nothing makes sense here man."
tt3501632,"00:41:42,588","00:41:45,382","The only thing that does make sense, is that nothing makes sense."
tt3501632,"00:41:45,418","00:41:48,030",Have anyone here fought the Grandmaster's champion?
tt3501632,"00:41:48,055","00:41:48,938",Doug has.
tt3501632,"00:41:48,964","00:41:52,471","Doug! Oh, right. Doug's dead. That's right..."
tt3501632,"00:41:52,475","00:41:55,457",Everyone who fights the Grandmaster's champion perishes.
tt3501632,"00:41:55,489","00:41:57,455",What about you? You're made of rocks.
tt3501632,"00:41:57,466","00:42:00,380","Perishable rock, eh."
tt3501632,"00:42:00,432","00:42:04,266","Yeah, no. I just do the smaller fights. Warm up the crowd and whatnot."
tt3501632,"00:42:04,339","00:42:07,860","- Wait, you're not gonna face him, are you? - Yes, I am."
tt3501632,"00:42:07,940","00:42:11,653","I'm gonna fight him, win. Then get the hell out of this place."
tt3501632,"00:42:11,726","00:42:15,448","That's exactly what Doug used to say. See you later, New Doug."
tt3501632,"00:42:23,378","00:42:25,433",Does no one remember me?
tt3501632,"00:42:25,469","00:42:28,555",Has no one been taught of history?
tt3501632,"00:42:33,127","00:42:35,182",Look at these lies.
tt3501632,"00:42:35,207","00:42:38,192",Goblets and garden parties?
tt3501632,"00:42:39,225","00:42:41,504",Peace treaties?
tt3501632,"00:42:42,548","00:42:45,600",Odin. Proud to have it...
tt3501632,"00:42:45,672","00:42:47,972",Shame now I've got it!
tt3501632,"00:43:05,981","00:43:07,960",We were unstoppable.
tt3501632,"00:43:08,023","00:43:13,169",I was his weapon in the conquest that built Asgard's empire.
tt3501632,"00:43:15,379","00:43:18,908","One by one, the Realms became ours."
tt3501632,"00:43:18,939","00:43:22,304","But then, simply because my ambition"
tt3501632,"00:43:22,346","00:43:25,278",outgrew his... He banished me.
tt3501632,"00:43:25,310","00:43:28,292",Caged me. Locked me away like an animal.
tt3501632,"00:43:28,333","00:43:35,310","Before that, Asgard's warriors were honored. Their bodies buried as heroes beneath this very palace."
tt3501632,"00:43:46,155","00:43:49,117",- Odin's treasures. - Fake!
tt3501632,"00:43:49,985","00:43:52,677",Most of the stuff in here is fake.
tt3501632,"00:43:52,999","00:43:55,019",Weak.
tt3501632,"00:43:55,936","00:43:58,267",Smaller than I thought it'd be.
tt3501632,"00:43:59,618","00:44:01,583",That's not bad.
tt3501632,"00:44:01,899","00:44:03,466",But this...
tt3501632,"00:44:03,491","00:44:06,613",The Eternal Flame.
tt3501632,"00:44:33,721","00:44:36,740",Want to see what true power really looks like?
tt3501632,"00:45:05,073","00:45:09,167","Fenris, my darling. What have they done to you?"
tt3501632,"00:45:10,147","00:45:15,200","With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn!"
tt3501632,"00:45:29,191","00:45:32,085",I missed you.
tt3501632,"00:45:32,231","00:45:35,757",I missed you all.
tt3501632,"00:45:37,558","00:45:43,099","Odin, may you take your place in the arms of Valhalla."
tt3501632,"00:45:58,803","00:46:01,611","Hurts, doesn't it? Being lied to."
tt3501632,"00:46:01,836","00:46:05,899","Being told you're one thing, and learning it's all a fiction."
tt3501632,"00:46:09,650","00:46:14,811","You didn't think I'd really come and see you, did you? This place is disgusting."
tt3501632,"00:46:17,248","00:46:19,143",Does this mean you don't want my help?
tt3501632,"00:46:19,187","00:46:22,910","Look, I couldn't jeopardize my position with the Grandmaster. It took me time to win his trust."
tt3501632,"00:46:22,953","00:46:25,034","He's a lunatic, but he can be an awful one."
tt3501632,"00:46:25,059","00:46:27,101","What I'm telling you is, you can join me"
tt3501632,"00:46:27,149","00:46:32,245","at the Grandmaster's side. Perhaps in time, an accident befalls the Grandmaster, and then..."
tt3501632,"00:46:38,743","00:46:40,967","You're not seriously thinking of going back, are you?"
tt3501632,"00:46:43,783","00:46:47,695","Our sister, destroyed your hammer like a piece of glass."
tt3501632,"00:46:48,040","00:46:49,972",She's stronger than both of us.
tt3501632,"00:46:49,998","00:46:53,980",She's stronger than you. You don't stand a chance. Do you understand what I'm saying to you?
tt3501632,"00:46:58,736","00:46:59,808",Fine.
tt3501632,"00:47:01,699","00:47:07,521",I guess I'll have to go it alone. Like I've always done.
tt3501632,"00:47:09,251","00:47:11,235",Would you say something?
tt3501632,"00:47:13,089","00:47:14,819",Say something!
tt3501632,"00:47:16,217","00:47:18,976",What would you like me to say?
tt3501632,"00:47:19,001","00:47:21,056",You faked your own death.
tt3501632,"00:47:21,268","00:47:25,194","You stole the throne, stripped Odin of his power, stranding him on Earth..."
tt3501632,"00:47:25,219","00:47:26,086",to die.
tt3501632,"00:47:26,118","00:47:31,134",Releasing the Goddess of Death. Have I said enough? Would you like me to go back further than the past 2 days?
tt3501632,"00:47:32,156","00:47:34,777",You know I haven't seen this...
tt3501632,"00:47:34,816","00:47:39,293",What I've heard of the Champion he talks of? I've heard he's astonishingly savage.
tt3501632,"00:47:39,398","00:47:44,220",I've placed a large wager against you tomorrow. Don't let me down.
tt3501632,"00:47:48,009","00:47:49,972","Piss off, ghost!"
tt3501632,"00:47:51,810","00:47:53,828",He's freaking gone.
tt3501632,"00:48:01,739","00:48:02,735","Oh, yuck!"
tt3501632,"00:48:02,744","00:48:05,403",This got so much hair and blood all over. Disgusting.
tt3501632,"00:48:05,428","00:48:09,771","Could you clean up the weapons, once you've finished your fight? Disgusting slobs!"
tt3501632,"00:48:10,230","00:48:11,613","Oh, Thor .."
tt3501632,"00:48:11,965","00:48:13,734",Want to use a big wooden fork?
tt3501632,"00:48:14,664","00:48:16,652","- No. - Yeah, not really useful."
tt3501632,"00:48:16,678","00:48:20,295",Unless you were fighting off 3 vampires that were huddled together.
tt3501632,"00:48:20,922","00:48:22,480","No, I really wish I had my hammer."
tt3501632,"00:48:22,505","00:48:24,449",- Hammer? - It's unique.
tt3501632,"00:48:24,474","00:48:28,267",It's made from this special metal from the heart of a dying star.
tt3501632,"00:48:28,293","00:48:31,559","And when I spun it really fast, it gave me the ability to fly."
tt3501632,"00:48:31,571","00:48:33,464",- You rode the hammer? - No. I...
tt3501632,"00:48:33,500","00:48:34,760",I didn't ride the hammer.
tt3501632,"00:48:34,786","00:48:38,456","- The hammer rode you on your back? - No, I spin it really fast"
tt3501632,"00:48:38,491","00:48:40,714","- and it pulled me off.. - Oh, my god."
tt3501632,"00:48:40,747","00:48:44,471",- The hammer pulled you off? - The ground! Pulled me off the ground. Up to the air.
tt3501632,"00:48:44,516","00:48:47,667","And I would fly. Everytime I threw it, it would always"
tt3501632,"00:48:47,707","00:48:49,202",come back to me.
tt3501632,"00:48:49,227","00:48:55,220",Sounds like you had a special relationship with this hammer and losing it felt like losing a loved one.
tt3501632,"00:48:55,246","00:48:57,367",That's a nice way of putting it.
tt3501632,"00:48:59,206","00:49:01,262",I said they're mine.
tt3501632,"00:49:01,290","00:49:04,299",That's the one that put me in here.
tt3501632,"00:49:04,557","00:49:08,227","Oh, yeah, Scrapper 142. Watch out with those Asgardians, man."
tt3501632,"00:49:08,253","00:49:10,095",They are hard to push.
tt3501632,"00:49:10,495","00:49:12,052",Asgardian?
tt3501632,"00:49:13,291","00:49:15,342",Hey! Hey!
tt3501632,"00:49:16,424","00:49:17,478",Hey.
tt3501632,"00:49:17,830","00:49:21,149",Do not zap me with that thing! I just want to talk.
tt3501632,"00:49:21,265","00:49:23,986",Asgard is in danger.
tt3501632,"00:49:27,872","00:49:29,689","My god, you are a Valkyrie."
tt3501632,"00:49:29,746","00:49:32,839",You know I used to wanna be a Valkyrie when I was younger.
tt3501632,"00:49:32,865","00:49:36,406","Until I found out you were all women. There's nothing wrong with women, of course."
tt3501632,"00:49:36,441","00:49:38,301",I love women.
tt3501632,"00:49:38,339","00:49:42,289","Sometimes a little too much. Not in a creepy way, more of a respectful"
tt3501632,"00:49:42,301","00:49:46,225",appreciation. I think it's great that there's an elite force of women
tt3501632,"00:49:46,261","00:49:48,648",warriors in our time.
tt3501632,"00:49:50,142","00:49:51,251",Are you done?
tt3501632,"00:49:51,287","00:49:52,410",Lord of Thunder! You're up!
tt3501632,"00:49:52,417","00:49:55,077",- Please help me. I need your help. - Bye.
tt3501632,"00:49:55,118","00:49:59,088",Then you must be a traitor or a coward because the Valkyrie are sworn to protect the throne.
tt3501632,"00:50:00,366","00:50:02,006","Listen closely, Your Majesty."
tt3501632,"00:50:02,045","00:50:05,972","This is Sakaar, not Asgard. And I'm a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie."
tt3501632,"00:50:09,082","00:50:10,137",Bring him in!
tt3501632,"00:50:10,439","00:50:13,267",And no one escapes this place.
tt3501632,"00:50:13,293","00:50:15,346",So you're gonna die anyway.
tt3501632,"00:50:26,595","00:50:30,741",Now don't you move. My hands aren't as steady as they used to be.
tt3501632,"00:50:30,783","00:50:37,692","By Odin's beard you shall not cut my hair, lest you feel the wrath of the Mighty Thor!"
tt3501632,"00:50:41,267","00:50:44,320","Please... Please kind sir, don't cut my hair."
tt3501632,"00:50:44,616","00:50:48,473",Please... No! No!
tt3501632,"00:51:01,837","00:51:04,889",Great show! What a night!
tt3501632,"00:51:05,083","00:51:07,066",Please.
tt3501632,"00:51:07,111","00:51:15,030","I'm your host. Big round of applause for all the competitors who today, died so gruesomely."
tt3501632,"00:51:17,129","00:51:22,492","What a show! What a night! This is what you've come for, and so have I."
tt3501632,"00:51:27,543","00:51:33,400","And now, without further ado, it's main event time."
tt3501632,"00:51:35,725","00:51:38,144",Making his first appearance...
tt3501632,"00:51:44,302","00:51:48,787","Ladies and gentlemen, I give you... Lord of Thunder."
tt3501632,"00:52:11,683","00:52:14,478",Watch out for his fingers. They make sparkles.
tt3501632,"00:52:27,171","00:52:30,990",He is a creature--- what can you say about him?
tt3501632,"00:52:31,030","00:52:35,974","Well, he's unique. There's nothing like him. I feel a sexual connection with him."
tt3501632,"00:52:37,562","00:52:39,544",He is undefeated...
tt3501632,"00:52:40,466","00:52:42,485",He's the reigning...
tt3501632,"00:52:43,870","00:52:45,993",He's the defending...
tt3501632,"00:52:47,738","00:52:50,882","Ladies and gentlemen, I give you..."
tt3501632,"00:52:54,792","00:53:00,110","Your, Incredible..."
tt3501632,"00:53:04,240","00:53:07,168",Yes!!!
tt3501632,"00:53:09,620","00:53:11,776",I have to get off this planet.
tt3501632,"00:53:11,803","00:53:14,913",Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
tt3501632,"00:53:22,581","00:53:26,476",Hey! Hey! We know each other!
tt3501632,"00:53:26,501","00:53:29,057",He's a friend from work!
tt3501632,"00:53:36,472","00:53:41,270",Where have you been? Everybody thought you were dead.
tt3501632,"00:53:41,295","00:53:45,148",So much has happened since I last saw you. I lost my hammer.
tt3501632,"00:53:45,228","00:53:49,804","Like yesterday, so that's still pretty fresh. Loki..."
tt3501632,"00:53:49,877","00:53:54,850",Loki's alive. Can you believe it? He's up there. Loki! Look who it is!
tt3501632,"00:53:56,881","00:53:59,461","Oh, Banner, I'd never thought I'd say this, but I..."
tt3501632,"00:53:59,511","00:54:02,338",I'm happy to see you.
tt3501632,"00:54:09,144","00:54:12,966","Banner! Hey, Banner!"
tt3501632,"00:54:13,264","00:54:15,708",No Banner! Only Hulk!
tt3501632,"00:54:16,022","00:54:17,509",What are you doing?
tt3501632,"00:54:17,535","00:54:19,295",It's me...
tt3501632,"00:54:19,320","00:54:20,511",Thor!
tt3501632,"00:54:39,343","00:54:43,268","Banner, we're friends. This is crazy. I don't want to hurt you."
tt3501632,"00:54:49,708","00:54:51,864",Here we go. Here we go.
tt3501632,"00:55:10,224","00:55:12,156",What?
tt3501632,"00:55:22,299","00:55:24,903","Hey, big guy."
tt3501632,"00:55:25,709","00:55:27,902",The sun's getting real low...
tt3501632,"00:55:38,712","00:55:41,276",That's it. Sun's going down.
tt3501632,"00:55:43,759","00:55:47,707",I don't want to hurt you anymore. No one will.
tt3501632,"00:55:59,575","00:56:02,629",Yes! That's how it feels!
tt3501632,"00:56:02,898","00:56:05,793",I'm just a huge fan of this sport.
tt3501632,"00:56:13,061","00:56:15,954",All right... Screw it.
tt3501632,"00:56:26,225","00:56:29,187","I know you're in there, Banner. I'll get you out."
tt3501632,"00:56:38,278","00:56:42,382",That's enough. You're embarassing me. I told them we were friends!
tt3501632,"00:58:10,909","00:58:15,924",Thunder! Thunder!
tt3501632,"00:58:15,949","00:58:21,001",Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!
tt3501632,"00:58:21,026","00:58:25,042",Thunder! Thunder!
tt3501632,"00:58:25,067","00:58:32,854",Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!
tt3501632,"00:58:53,631","00:58:56,649","Another day, another Doug."
tt3501632,"00:59:04,058","00:59:06,814",What is that noise?
tt3501632,"00:59:06,879","00:59:10,392",The common folk aren't exactly falling in line.
tt3501632,"00:59:10,480","00:59:14,089",There's a resistance trying to knock down the front gates.
tt3501632,"00:59:19,037","00:59:22,000","Tell me about yourself, Skurge."
tt3501632,"00:59:22,002","00:59:24,643","Well, my dad was a stonemason,"
tt3501632,"00:59:24,690","00:59:29,482","Yeah, I'll stop you there. What I meant was, what's your ambition?"
tt3501632,"00:59:30,944","00:59:34,472",I just want a chance to prove myself.
tt3501632,"00:59:34,987","00:59:40,397","Recognized. When I was young, every great king had an executioner."
tt3501632,"00:59:40,469","00:59:46,251","Not just to execute people, but also to execute their vision."
tt3501632,"00:59:47,279","00:59:52,976","But mainly, to execute people. Still, it was a great honor."
tt3501632,"00:59:55,081","01:00:02,788",I was Odin's executioner. And you shall be my executioner.
tt3501632,"01:00:08,108","01:00:11,263",Let's begin our conquest.
tt3501632,"01:00:21,880","01:00:24,843","Skurge, where's the sword?"
tt3501632,"01:00:28,455","01:00:32,105",The sword is the key to opening the Bifrost.
tt3501632,"01:00:32,258","01:00:35,769","Those people you mentioned, the ones who aren't falling in line."
tt3501632,"01:00:36,453","01:00:38,559",Round them up.
tt3501632,"01:00:59,595","01:01:01,717",Go on.
tt3501632,"01:01:15,782","01:01:18,684","Sorry about that, these bloody things are everywhere."
tt3501632,"01:01:18,805","01:01:20,598",Come on.
tt3501632,"01:01:54,981","01:01:57,068",You will be safe here.
tt3501632,"01:03:03,948","01:03:06,842",Are we cool?
tt3501632,"01:03:09,468","01:03:12,454",Hulk in a hot tub.
tt3501632,"01:03:13,084","01:03:16,170",- So how long have you been like that? - Like what?
tt3501632,"01:03:16,347","01:03:19,764","Like this. Big, green, stupid."
tt3501632,"01:03:19,972","01:03:22,818",Hulk always Hulk.
tt3501632,"01:03:26,937","01:03:28,938",How did you get here?
tt3501632,"01:03:29,895","01:03:32,310",- Winning. - You mean cheating?
tt3501632,"01:03:32,336","01:03:35,139",Do they wear one of these? When you won?
tt3501632,"01:03:35,165","01:03:37,760",How did you arrive here?
tt3501632,"01:03:39,865","01:03:43,795","- Quinjet. - Yes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?"
tt3501632,"01:03:48,157","01:03:52,344","Ah, that's naked. That's very naked."
tt3501632,"01:03:55,422","01:03:58,607",That's in my brain now.
tt3501632,"01:03:58,760","01:04:00,454",Quinjet.
tt3501632,"01:04:09,642","01:04:13,500","Yes, I'm getting us out of here."
tt3501632,"01:04:13,597","01:04:17,624",This is terrible. You'll love Asgard.
tt3501632,"01:04:17,649","01:04:21,515","- It's big, golden, shiny. - Hulk stay."
tt3501632,"01:04:21,748","01:04:24,955",No. My people need me to get back to Asgard.
tt3501632,"01:04:25,462","01:04:28,708",- We must prevent Ragnarok. - Ragnarok?
tt3501632,"01:04:28,733","01:04:33,266",Prophesied death of my homeworld. The end of days. End of everything.
tt3501632,"01:04:33,412","01:04:36,065","If you help me to get back to Asgard,"
tt3501632,"01:04:36,233","01:04:40,316",- I can help you get back to earth. - Earth hate Hulk.
tt3501632,"01:04:40,373","01:04:44,252","Earth loves Hulk. They love you. You're one of the Avengers, one of the team."
tt3501632,"01:04:44,278","01:04:46,881","That's what friends do, support each other."
tt3501632,"01:04:46,913","01:04:51,109",- You're Banner's friend. - I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you.
tt3501632,"01:04:51,182","01:04:53,464",- Banner's friend. - I don't even like Banner.
tt3501632,"01:04:53,496","01:04:55,763","I mean, the numbers, and science and stuff."
tt3501632,"01:04:55,791","01:04:59,206","- Thor go, Hulk stay. - Fine."
tt3501632,"01:04:59,351","01:05:03,797","Stay here. Stupid place. It's hideous, by the way."
tt3501632,"01:05:03,829","01:05:08,810",The red and the white? Just pick a color. Ridiculous.
tt3501632,"01:05:08,866","01:05:11,631",- Smash you. - You didn't smash anything.
tt3501632,"01:05:11,678","01:05:13,560",- I won that fight. - I smash you.
tt3501632,"01:05:13,592","01:05:15,899",- Yeah. Sure. - Baby arms.
tt3501632,"01:05:15,932","01:05:20,915",- What? - Baby! Thor go.
tt3501632,"01:05:26,538","01:05:29,086",Thor go again.
tt3501632,"01:05:32,121","01:05:34,241",Thor home.
tt3501632,"01:05:43,801","01:05:47,114",- Hulk trains. - Great. Have fun.
tt3501632,"01:05:47,186","01:05:50,190","- Hey, big guy. - Hey, little girl."
tt3501632,"01:05:50,275","01:05:52,785",- What are you up to? - Winning.
tt3501632,"01:06:02,034","01:06:05,688","Heimdall, I know you can see me."
tt3501632,"01:06:05,749","01:06:09,696",I need you to help me.
tt3501632,"01:06:09,721","01:06:13,546",Help me see.
tt3501632,"01:06:21,862","01:06:24,914","I see you, but you're far away."
tt3501632,"01:06:24,948","01:06:28,177",- What's going on here? - Come see for yourself.
tt3501632,"01:06:30,216","01:06:35,933",I provided refuge in a stronghold built by ancestors.
tt3501632,"01:06:35,958","01:06:37,658",Our only escape is Bifrost.
tt3501632,"01:06:37,683","01:06:40,455",You're talking about evacuating Asgard?
tt3501632,"01:06:42,520","01:06:45,410",We won't last long if we stay.
tt3501632,"01:06:45,435","01:06:49,483",She draws her power from Asgard and grows stronger every day. Come on!
tt3501632,"01:06:53,329","01:06:58,307","Hela is madness. If I let her live, she'll consume Nine Realms and all the cosmos."
tt3501632,"01:06:58,375","01:07:01,901","- We need you. - I'm working on it, I don't even know where I am."
tt3501632,"01:07:01,940","01:07:04,607",You're on a planet surrounded by doorways. Go thru one.
tt3501632,"01:07:04,632","01:07:07,380",- Which one? - The big one.
tt3501632,"01:07:34,479","01:07:37,597",- Thor sad. - Shut up.
tt3501632,"01:07:39,554","01:07:42,411",Thor sad!
tt3501632,"01:07:42,436","01:07:44,424",I'm not sad. Idiot.
tt3501632,"01:07:44,756","01:07:46,938",I'm pissed off.
tt3501632,"01:07:46,994","01:07:50,368",Angry. I lost my father.
tt3501632,"01:07:50,408","01:07:52,895",I lost my hammer.
tt3501632,"01:07:52,944","01:07:56,591",- Whine. Whine. - You're not even listening!
tt3501632,"01:07:56,749","01:08:02,182",- Stop kick stuff! - You're being a very bad friend!
tt3501632,"01:08:02,208","01:08:04,987",- You bad friend. - Do you know what we call you?
tt3501632,"01:08:05,013","01:08:09,399",- We call you the stupid Avenger. - You tiny Avenger!
tt3501632,"01:08:12,123","01:08:14,235","- What are you, crazy? - Yes."
tt3501632,"01:08:14,279","01:08:18,081",You know what? Earth does hate you.
tt3501632,"01:08:42,022","01:08:45,106",Sorry that I said those things.
tt3501632,"01:08:45,131","01:08:49,145","You are not the stupid Avenger, nobody calls you that."
tt3501632,"01:08:49,170","01:08:51,029",It's okay.
tt3501632,"01:08:51,064","01:08:53,827",You just can't go around throwing shields at people. You'll kill them.
tt3501632,"01:08:53,859","01:08:59,054",I know. It's just I get so angry all the time. Always angry.
tt3501632,"01:08:59,156","01:09:03,275",We're the same. Just a couple of hot-headed fools.
tt3501632,"01:09:03,340","01:09:08,262","Yes, same. Hulk like fire. Thor like water."
tt3501632,"01:09:08,673","01:09:12,688",- We're kinda both like fire. - But Hulk like real fire.
tt3501632,"01:09:13,705","01:09:20,521",Hulk like raging fire. Thor like smoldering fire.
tt3501632,"01:09:20,588","01:09:24,343","Hulk, I need you to do something for me."
tt3501632,"01:09:27,919","01:09:31,036","Hey, little girl."
tt3501632,"01:09:38,630","01:09:41,667",What's going on? What are you...
tt3501632,"01:09:49,634","01:09:54,695",You're so thickheaded that you can't tell when someone hiding across the universe wants to be left alone.
tt3501632,"01:09:54,824","01:09:57,862","- We need to talk. - No, you won't talk to me."
tt3501632,"01:09:57,862","01:10:00,899",- I need her to stay here. - Done.
tt3501632,"01:10:03,542","01:10:07,591",- Stay. Please? - Please.
tt3501632,"01:10:10,016","01:10:12,040",All right.
tt3501632,"01:10:12,044","01:10:15,078",Here's the deal.
tt3501632,"01:10:15,079","01:10:17,104","I'll listen to you,"
tt3501632,"01:10:17,104","01:10:20,140",until this is empty.
tt3501632,"01:10:20,140","01:10:25,199","Asgard is in danger. People are dying, we need to get back there. I need your help."
tt3501632,"01:10:26,213","01:10:28,238",Finished. Bye.
tt3501632,"01:10:30,261","01:10:32,285",Odin is dead.
tt3501632,"01:10:34,311","01:10:37,347","Hela, the goddess of death, has invaded Asgard."
tt3501632,"01:10:37,348","01:10:42,409","- If Hela's back, then Asgard's already lost. - I'm going to stop her."
tt3501632,"01:10:43,418","01:10:45,445",- Alone? - Nope. I'm putting together a team.
tt3501632,"01:10:45,445","01:10:51,516","- It's me, you, and the big guy. - No, no team! Only Hulk."
tt3501632,"01:10:51,517","01:10:55,565",- It's me and you. - I think it's only you.
tt3501632,"01:10:55,565","01:10:59,616","The Valkyrie are a legend. Elite warriors of Asgard, sworn to defend the throne."
tt3501632,"01:10:59,616","01:11:02,652",I'm not getting dragged into another one of Odin's family squabbles.
tt3501632,"01:11:02,653","01:11:04,677",- What's that supposed to mean? - Your sister.
tt3501632,"01:11:04,677","01:11:10,759","Her power comes from Asgard, same as yours. But grew beyond Odin's control, she massacred everyone to try to seize the throne."
tt3501632,"01:11:10,759","01:11:14,809","When she tried to escape her banishment, he sent the Valkyrie to fight her back."
tt3501632,"01:11:15,821","01:11:19,869",I only survived because...
tt3501632,"01:11:19,869","01:11:22,907","Look, I've already faced her once back when I believed in the throne."
tt3501632,"01:11:22,907","01:11:25,944",It cost me everything. That's what's wrong with Asgard.
tt3501632,"01:11:25,944","01:11:31,003","- The throne, the secrets, the whole golden sham. - I agree."
tt3501632,"01:11:31,005","01:11:35,052",- Don't get familiar. - I agree.
tt3501632,"01:11:35,052","01:11:40,112",That's why I turned down the throne. This isn't about the crown. This is about the people.
tt3501632,"01:11:40,113","01:11:42,138","And they're dying, and they're your people, too."
tt3501632,"01:11:42,138","01:11:44,163",Forget it.
tt3501632,"01:11:44,163","01:11:49,222",- I have. - Okay. Good.
tt3501632,"01:11:49,223","01:11:52,260",- Thank you. For this. - For what?
tt3501632,"01:11:54,283","01:11:56,310","You didn't see that, did you?"
tt3501632,"01:11:56,310","01:12:00,356",Well...
tt3501632,"01:12:00,358","01:12:06,431",Go ahead. Stay here and enslave people for that lunatic.
tt3501632,"01:12:06,432","01:12:08,455",Keep drinking. Keep hiding.
tt3501632,"01:12:08,456","01:12:14,538","Me, I choose to run toward my problems, and not away from them."
tt3501632,"01:12:15,550","01:12:17,575",That's what---
tt3501632,"01:12:21,624","01:12:24,659",Because that's what heroes do.
tt3501632,"01:12:35,793","01:12:37,820","Friend, stay!"
tt3501632,"01:12:48,953","01:12:50,976",Yes!
tt3501632,"01:13:11,221","01:13:13,246",Come on ..

tt3501632,"01:14:00,096","01:14:02,122","We can't track you in stealth mode, so,"

tt3501632,"01:14:07,913","01:14:09,939",I need you...
tt3501632,"01:14:24,119","01:14:29,180",Hulk very bad!
tt3501632,"01:14:34,593","01:14:38,641",- What's this? - Banner?
tt3501632,"01:14:40,500","01:14:43,536",Are you all right? Banner?
tt3501632,"01:14:45,369","01:14:49,428",The sun's going down. That's it. Breathe.
tt3501632,"01:14:49,428","01:14:54,596",- I won't hurt you. Sun's going down.. - Thor...
tt3501632,"01:14:55,499","01:14:58,536",- What happened to your hair? - Some creepy old man cut it off.
tt3501632,"01:14:58,536","01:15:01,573",It looks good. Where are we?
tt3501632,"01:15:01,574","01:15:05,621","- How's Nat? - Uh, Nat is good."
tt3501632,"01:15:05,801","01:15:07,979",- And what about Sokovia? - Sokovia?
tt3501632,"01:15:08,006","01:15:10,630","- The city, Sokovia, did we save it? - Banner, listen..."
tt3501632,"01:15:10,681","01:15:13,294","- What? - Sokovia, Ultron, that was 2 years ago."
tt3501632,"01:15:13,518","01:15:16,081",What are you saying?
tt3501632,"01:15:16,755","01:15:20,269",- I've been Hulk for 2 years? - I'm afraid so.
tt3501632,"01:15:25,866","01:15:28,901",What the hell happened?
tt3501632,"01:15:30,925","01:15:32,959","Banner, there's something you should know."
tt3501632,"01:15:34,974","01:15:37,000",- Voice activation required. - Banner.
tt3501632,"01:15:37,000","01:15:39,033","- Welcome, Strongest Avenger. - Uh, what?"
tt3501632,"01:15:39,033","01:15:43,073",Ship's log.
tt3501632,"01:15:52,184","01:15:54,217","- Thor, where are we? - Yeah, about that..."
tt3501632,"01:15:54,217","01:16:01,300","Sakaar. Hear ye. Attention, please. I have some bad news. My beloved champion has gone missing."
tt3501632,"01:16:01,301","01:16:03,327",Take to the streets. Celebrate my champion.
tt3501632,"01:16:04,337","01:16:05,352",- Who's that? - He kind of runs the place.
tt3501632,"01:16:05,352","01:16:08,388",You actually lived in his house for a while.
tt3501632,"01:16:08,388","01:16:09,400",- I did? - Yeah.
tt3501632,"01:16:09,400","01:16:12,436",Quite a lot has happened. You and I had a fight recently.
tt3501632,"01:16:12,436","01:16:14,461","- Did I win? - No, I won. Easy."
tt3501632,"01:16:14,461","01:16:16,485","- That doesn't sound right. - Well, it's true."
tt3501632,"01:16:16,486","01:16:21,546",It seems that that seductive Lord of Thunder has stolen him away...
tt3501632,"01:16:21,546","01:16:24,583",Seductive God of Thunder. We have to go.
tt3501632,"01:16:27,620","01:16:32,679","This is bad. This is really, really bad."
tt3501632,"01:16:33,694","01:16:35,718",Thor.
tt3501632,"01:16:36,728","01:16:40,777","- I think I'm freaking out. - No, don't freak out."
tt3501632,"01:16:40,777","01:16:43,814",- You're okay. Put these on. - These are Tony's clothes. Is he here?
tt3501632,"01:16:43,814","01:16:47,872","No, he's not here. Listen, you stay calm, okay? The sun's going down."
tt3501632,"01:16:47,873","01:16:49,897",The sun's going down.
tt3501632,"01:16:55,971","01:16:59,008",I'm upset.
tt3501632,"01:17:01,032","01:17:05,079",I'm very upset. Do you know what I like about being upset?
tt3501632,"01:17:05,079","01:17:09,129",Blame. And now that's the mindset that I'm in. And you know who I'm blaming?
tt3501632,"01:17:09,129","01:17:12,165","- Grandmaster, I .. - Hey, don't interrupt me."
tt3501632,"01:17:12,165","01:17:16,213",Why are you handing me the melt stick?
tt3501632,"01:17:16,214","01:17:20,262",He was interrupting. That's not a capital violation.
tt3501632,"01:17:20,262","01:17:23,301",Where was I? My precious champion has gone missing.
tt3501632,"01:17:23,301","01:17:26,335",And it's all because of that Lord of Thunder.
tt3501632,"01:17:26,335","01:17:28,359","It's all because of him, your brother."
tt3501632,"01:17:28,360","01:17:32,411",Whatever the story is. Adopted or complicated. I'm sure there's a history.
tt3501632,"01:17:32,411","01:17:34,436",And your contender.
tt3501632,"01:17:35,445","01:17:39,494","My dear friend, if you were to give me 12 hours, I can bring them both back to you alive."
tt3501632,"01:17:39,494","01:17:41,520",I can do it in 2.
tt3501632,"01:17:41,520","01:17:44,555",- I can do it in one. - Let's stop there.
tt3501632,"01:17:44,555","01:17:47,593","You know what, I woke up this morning thinking about public execution."
tt3501632,"01:17:48,605","01:17:52,663","But for now, I'll settle for this sweet little..."
tt3501632,"01:17:53,674","01:17:56,712","So, you're on the clock."
tt3501632,"01:17:57,725","01:18:00,753","- What have you done? - I don't answer to you, Lackey."
tt3501632,"01:18:00,760","01:18:03,799","It's Loki, and you will answer to the Grandmaster."
tt3501632,"01:18:05,824","01:18:08,860",Why would you help my brother escape with that green fool?
tt3501632,"01:18:08,860","01:18:11,894",I don't help anyone.
tt3501632,"01:18:17,967","01:18:19,993",You are a Valkyrie.
tt3501632,"01:18:24,041","01:18:27,077",I thought the Valkyrie have all died gruesome deaths.
tt3501632,"01:18:27,077","01:18:29,102",Choose your next words wisely.
tt3501632,"01:18:29,102","01:18:34,162","I'm terribly sorry, must've been a very painful memory."
tt3501632,"01:19:24,783","01:19:30,858","The sun's going down, the sun's really low..."
tt3501632,"01:19:30,858","01:19:33,892",- The sun's going down... - Would you stop saying that?
tt3501632,"01:19:33,892","01:19:34,904",I just need you to stay calm.
tt3501632,"01:19:34,904","01:19:38,953","- Calm? I'm on an alien planet. - It's just a planet, you've been to one before."
tt3501632,"01:19:38,954","01:19:43,002","- Yeah! One! - Well, now you've been on two! That's a good thing."
tt3501632,"01:19:43,002","01:19:48,062","- A new experience. - My neurons, they're firing faster than my brain can handle the information..."
tt3501632,"01:19:48,063","01:19:50,088",The whole thing is totally different this time.
tt3501632,"01:19:50,089","01:19:57,173","I mean, in the past when I was Hulk, I had a hand on the wheel, but this time he had the keys and I was locked in the trunk!"
tt3501632,"01:19:57,174","01:19:59,198",You're back now and that's all that matters.
tt3501632,"01:19:59,198","01:20:04,268","No, it's not what matters. What I'm trying to tell you is that if I turn into the Hulk again, Banner may not come back."
tt3501632,"01:20:04,268","01:20:07,306",And we're stranded in a planet that is designed to stress me out.
tt3501632,"01:20:07,306","01:20:11,353","We are not stranded, I'm gonna figure out a way to get us home."
tt3501632,"01:20:11,353","01:20:13,379","- Thank you. - Not your home, though. Asgard."
tt3501632,"01:20:13,379","01:20:15,401",- My home. - What?
tt3501632,"01:20:15,402","01:20:21,476","Listen, my people are in grave danger. You and I have to fight this powerful being who happens to be my sister."
tt3501632,"01:20:21,477","01:20:25,524","Okay, that is so wrong on so many... I don't wanna fight your sister."
tt3501632,"01:20:25,524","01:20:26,536",- That's a family issue. - She's an evil being.
tt3501632,"01:20:27,551","01:20:31,597",I don't care what she is. I'm not fighting any more beings. I'm sick of it.
tt3501632,"01:20:31,597","01:20:36,660","I just told you. If I turn into the Hulk, I am never gonna come back again."
tt3501632,"01:20:36,660","01:20:39,696","- And you don't care! - No, I'm putting together a team."
tt3501632,"01:20:39,697","01:20:40,709",Hulk is the fire.
tt3501632,"01:20:40,709","01:20:44,756","- Wait, you're just using me to get to the Hulk. - What? No!"
tt3501632,"01:20:44,757","01:20:46,781",You don't care about me. You're not my friend.
tt3501632,"01:20:46,781","01:20:51,842","No. I don't even like the Hulk. He's like.... Smash, smash!"
tt3501632,"01:20:51,842","01:20:53,868",I prefer you.
tt3501632,"01:20:53,868","01:20:55,890",Thanks.
tt3501632,"01:20:55,890","01:21:00,951","But honestly when it comes to fighting evil beings, he is very powerful and useful."
tt3501632,"01:21:00,951","01:21:02,985","- Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too. - Is he, though?"
tt3501632,"01:21:02,985","01:21:06,013","Okay, how many PhD's does Hulk have? Zero."
tt3501632,"01:21:06,013","01:21:09,050",How many PhD's does Banner have? Seven.
tt3501632,"01:21:09,050","01:21:13,108","Fine, you don't have to fight anyone. But we're in danger here, so let's get on it."
tt3501632,"01:21:16,144","01:21:18,169",- What are you doing with that? - I need a disguise. I'm a fugitive.
tt3501632,"01:21:18,170","01:21:21,205",- I need a disguise. - You are in disguise.
tt3501632,"01:21:21,205","01:21:23,229",- I'll be Tony Stark. - What?
tt3501632,"01:21:23,229","01:21:25,254","Yeah, Tony and the gypsy."
tt3501632,"01:21:25,254","01:21:27,279","No, you're not Tony. You're Bruce Banner."
tt3501632,"01:21:27,279","01:21:29,302",Then why did you dress me up like Tony?
tt3501632,"01:21:29,303","01:21:30,315",Because you were naked.
tt3501632,"01:21:30,315","01:21:32,339","Okay, I'll give you that."
tt3501632,"01:21:32,339","01:21:35,376",- What are you doing? Stop doing that. - Sorry. Tony wears his pants super tight.
tt3501632,"01:21:35,376","01:21:37,401",Why are you being so weird?
tt3501632,"01:21:37,401","01:21:41,449","I don't know, maybe the fact that I was trapped for 2 years..."
tt3501632,"01:21:41,449","01:21:43,475",inside of a monster made me a little weird!
tt3501632,"01:21:43,476","01:21:46,511",Hey... it's okay. Look...
tt3501632,"01:21:46,511","01:21:52,583","Calm down... come on. We'll go to Asgard, and you don't worry about being the Hulk ever again."
tt3501632,"01:21:52,583","01:21:54,609",- All right? - All right.
tt3501632,"01:22:00,682","01:22:03,718","Oh, this is bad..."
tt3501632,"01:22:06,756","01:22:09,791",Banner! Banner!
tt3501632,"01:22:11,825","01:22:13,841",Banner!
tt3501632,"01:22:27,008","01:22:30,046",- Banner! - Thor!
tt3501632,"01:22:41,179","01:22:43,204",- Hi. - Hi.
tt3501632,"01:22:43,204","01:22:46,240",- I was gonna do that. - I did it first.
tt3501632,"01:22:46,240","01:22:48,265",Good. What are you doing here?
tt3501632,"01:22:48,265","01:22:50,289",What are you doing here? I thought you were leaving.
tt3501632,"01:22:50,289","01:22:52,314",I got sidetracked.
tt3501632,"01:22:52,314","01:22:55,349",- What's with the...? - This is my disguise.
tt3501632,"01:22:55,349","01:22:59,397","- I can see your face. - Not when I do this, you can't."
tt3501632,"01:22:59,398","01:23:03,448",Looks like you can help me. Do you want to help us?
tt3501632,"01:23:08,509","01:23:12,559",What's are those things on her eyes? Are those people that she's killed? So beautiful and strong...
tt3501632,"01:23:12,559","01:23:14,583",- Who is this guy? - A friend.
tt3501632,"01:23:14,583","01:23:16,608",- I'm Bruce. - I feel like I know you.
tt3501632,"01:23:16,608","01:23:18,640","I feel like I know you, too."
tt3501632,"01:23:22,689","01:23:26,738","Look, I spent years in a haze, trying to forget my past."
tt3501632,"01:23:26,738","01:23:30,786",Sakaar seemed like the best place to drink and forget and to die one day.
tt3501632,"01:23:30,786","01:23:33,823","I was thinking if you drink too much, that's probably what's gonna kill you."
tt3501632,"01:23:33,824","01:23:35,849",- I don't plan to stop drinking. - Oh.
tt3501632,"01:23:35,849","01:23:38,884",But I don't wanna forget. I can't run away anymore.
tt3501632,"01:23:38,884","01:23:44,959","So if I'm gonna die, it may as well be driving my sword thru the heart of that murderous hag."
tt3501632,"01:23:44,959","01:23:46,983",Good. Yeah.
tt3501632,"01:23:46,983","01:23:51,030",So I'm saying that I wanna be on the team.
tt3501632,"01:23:51,030","01:23:55,079","- Has it got a name? - Yeah, it's called the... Revengers."
tt3501632,"01:23:55,080","01:23:59,130",- Revengers? - Because I'm getting revenge. You're getting revenge.
tt3501632,"01:23:59,130","01:24:04,191",- You're... do you want revenge? - I'm.... undecided.
tt3501632,"01:24:04,192","01:24:09,251","Also, I've got a peace offering."
tt3501632,"01:24:11,275","01:24:14,311",Surprise!
tt3501632,"01:24:19,381","01:24:22,410",Had to be sure.
tt3501632,"01:24:25,446","01:24:27,471","Hello, Bruce."
tt3501632,"01:24:27,472","01:24:31,529","So, the last time I saw you, you were trying to kill everybody. Where are you at these days?"
tt3501632,"01:24:32,532","01:24:34,566",It varies from moment to moment.
tt3501632,"01:24:34,566","01:24:40,637","- Is that a Dragon Fang? Oh, my God! - It is."
tt3501632,"01:24:40,637","01:24:41,652",The famed sword of the Valkyrie.
tt3501632,"01:24:41,653","01:24:45,699","So, Sakaar and Asgard are about as far apart as a system, our best bet"
tt3501632,"01:24:45,699","01:24:48,735",is a wormhole just outside the city limits.
tt3501632,"01:24:48,735","01:24:51,774","Refuel on Xandar and we can be back in Asgard in, 18 months?"
tt3501632,"01:24:51,774","01:24:55,821",Nope. We are going through the big one.
tt3501632,"01:24:55,821","01:24:58,856",- The Devil's Anus? - Anus?
tt3501632,"01:24:58,856","01:25:01,895","- Wait, whose anus? - For the record, I didn't know it was called that when I picked it."
tt3501632,"01:25:01,895","01:25:05,943",That looks like a Clapton Neutron star inside of an Einstein-Rosen bridge.
tt3501632,"01:25:05,944","01:25:08,980",We need another ship. That will tear mine to pieces.
tt3501632,"01:25:08,980","01:25:12,018",She's right. We need one that can withstand the geode that stray from singularities.
tt3501632,"01:25:12,018","01:25:16,719",And has an offline power steering system that can function without a computer.
tt3501632,"01:25:16,752","01:25:20,116","And we need one with cupholders because we're gonna die, so... drinks!"
tt3501632,"01:25:20,116","01:25:24,164","- Do I know you? I feel like I know you. - I feel like I know you, too. It's weird."
tt3501632,"01:25:24,165","01:25:30,245",What do you say? Uncharted intergalactic travel wormhole cosmic gateway? Talk about adventure.
tt3501632,"01:25:30,245","01:25:33,273",- We need a ship. - Two ships.
tt3501632,"01:25:33,273","01:25:36,319",- Have to look top of the line models. - I don't mean to impose...
tt3501632,"01:25:38,335","01:25:40,369",But the Grandmaster has a great many ships.
tt3501632,"01:25:40,369","01:25:44,416",I may even have stolen the access codes to his security system.
tt3501632,"01:25:44,416","01:25:46,442",And suddenly you're overcome with the urge to do the right thing?
tt3501632,"01:25:46,442","01:25:49,478","Heavens, no. I've run out of favor with the Grandmaster..."
tt3501632,"01:25:49,479","01:25:55,551","In exchange for codes and access to a ship, I'm asking for safe passage. Thru the Anus."
tt3501632,"01:25:55,551","01:26:00,611",So you can get us access to the garage without setting off the alarms?
tt3501632,"01:26:00,611","01:26:01,624","Yes, brother. I can."
tt3501632,"01:26:01,625","01:26:04,662","Okay, can I just... A quick FYI?"
tt3501632,"01:26:04,662","01:26:09,721",I was just talking to him and he was ready to kill any of us.
tt3501632,"01:26:09,721","01:26:12,758","- He did try to kill me. - Yes, me too. Many, many occasions."
tt3501632,"01:26:12,758","01:26:17,819","One time when we're children, he transformed into a snake, and he knows I love snakes, so I went to admire it..."
tt3501632,"01:26:17,819","01:26:23,892","And he transformed back to himself, and he's like, ""It's me!"" And he stabbed me."
tt3501632,"01:26:23,892","01:26:25,917",We were 8 at the time.
tt3501632,"01:26:25,917","01:26:28,954","If we're boosting a ship, we're gonna need to draw some guards away from the palace."
tt3501632,"01:26:28,954","01:26:29,974",Why not set the beast loose?
tt3501632,"01:26:30,977","01:26:33,002",- Shhh. Shut up. - He said a beast?
tt3501632,"01:26:33,002","01:26:35,036",There's no beast. He's just being stupid.
tt3501632,"01:26:35,036","01:26:37,061",- We're gonna start a revolution. - Revolution?
tt3501632,"01:26:37,061","01:26:40,088",- I'll explain later. - Who is this guy again?
tt3501632,"01:26:40,088","01:26:42,113",I'll explain later.
tt3501632,"01:26:42,121","01:26:47,184","Is it some sort of protoplasm, all the stuff coming out of you or eggs?"
tt3501632,"01:26:48,195","01:26:50,219",It looks like eggs.
tt3501632,"01:26:51,232","01:26:54,267",Ooh!
tt3501632,"01:26:59,328","01:27:01,355",- I'm looking for Korg. - Who's asking?
tt3501632,"01:27:01,355","01:27:05,403",I know you're asking. Is anyone else asking or just you?
tt3501632,"01:27:05,403","01:27:08,440",The Lord of Thunder sends his best.
tt3501632,"01:27:11,475","01:27:13,500",The revolution has begun!
tt3501632,"01:27:13,500","01:27:15,525",Revolution? How did this happen?
tt3501632,"01:27:15,525","01:27:22,609",Don't know. But the arena's mainframe for the obedience disks are deactivated and the slaves have armed themselves.
tt3501632,"01:27:22,610","01:27:26,658","- Oh, I don't like that word. - Mainframe?"
tt3501632,"01:27:26,659","01:27:30,708","No, why would I not like mainframe? No. The S word."
tt3501632,"01:27:30,709","01:27:34,757",- Sorry. The prisoners with jobs have armed themselves. - Okay. That's better.
tt3501632,"01:27:42,854","01:27:45,891",Listen. We should talk.
tt3501632,"01:27:45,892","01:27:49,949",I disagree. Open communication is never our family's forte.
tt3501632,"01:27:49,949","01:27:53,999",You have no idea. Been quite the revelation since we last spoke.
tt3501632,"01:27:53,999","01:27:56,022",Hello.
tt3501632,"01:27:56,022","01:27:58,047",Hi.
tt3501632,"01:28:04,121","01:28:06,145",The Odin boys together.
tt3501632,"01:28:06,145","01:28:10,194",It's almost poetic that his death have split us apart.
tt3501632,"01:28:16,265","01:28:18,289",We might as well be strangers now.
tt3501632,"01:28:18,290","01:28:22,338","Two sons of the crown, set adrift."
tt3501632,"01:28:22,339","01:28:24,364",Do not move!
tt3501632,"01:28:24,364","01:28:26,388",Thought you didn't wanna talk about it.
tt3501632,"01:28:27,402","01:28:28,414",Here's the thing...
tt3501632,"01:28:28,414","01:28:33,474",- I'm probably better off staying here on Sakaar. - That's exactly what I was thinking.
tt3501632,"01:28:34,486","01:28:37,522",- Did you just agree with me? - This place is perfect for you.
tt3501632,"01:28:37,522","01:28:41,571","It's savage, chaotic, lawless. You'll do great here."
tt3501632,"01:28:41,571","01:28:44,609",Do you truly think so little of me?
tt3501632,"01:28:44,617","01:28:50,682","Loki, I thought the world of you. I thought we were gonna fight side by side forever, but..."
tt3501632,"01:28:50,683","01:28:53,727","At the end of the day, you're you and I'm me."
tt3501632,"01:28:53,727","01:29:00,812","Maybe there's still good in you, but let's be honest. Our paths diverged a long time ago."
tt3501632,"01:29:03,851","01:29:08,911",We have. It's probably for the best if we never see each other again.
tt3501632,"01:29:08,911","01:29:11,948",That's what you've always wanted.
tt3501632,"01:29:14,983","01:29:17,007","Hey, let's do ''get help.''"
tt3501632,"01:29:17,007","01:29:18,021",- What? - ''Get help.''
tt3501632,"01:29:18,021","01:29:19,033","- No. - Come on, you'll love it."
tt3501632,"01:29:19,034","01:29:21,058",- I hate it. It's humiliating. - It's great. Works every time.
tt3501632,"01:29:22,068","01:29:23,081",- Do you have a better plan? - No.
tt3501632,"01:29:23,081","01:29:27,130",- We're doing it. - We are not doing ''get help.''
tt3501632,"01:29:27,131","01:29:30,166","Get help, please! My brother is dying!"
tt3501632,"01:29:30,166","01:29:33,202",Get help! Help him.
tt3501632,"01:29:34,215","01:29:39,278","- Classic. Not for me, it's not. - Still hate it. Humiliating."
tt3501632,"01:29:39,278","01:29:43,326",- Now which one's the ship you told us to get? - The commodore.
tt3501632,"01:29:47,374","01:29:51,423",Though I feel it wouldn't make much of a difference.
tt3501632,"01:29:52,435","01:29:54,461",Loki...
tt3501632,"01:29:54,461","01:29:57,506","I know I betrayed you many times before, but this time it's truly nothing personal."
tt3501632,"01:29:58,509","01:30:00,543",The reward for your capture will set me up nicely.
tt3501632,"01:30:01,546","01:30:04,591","- Never one for sentiment, were you? - Easier to let it burn."
tt3501632,"01:30:04,591","01:30:06,617",I agree.
tt3501632,"01:30:13,701","01:30:16,737","Oh, it looks painful."
tt3501632,"01:30:16,738","01:30:19,774","Dear Brother, you're becoming predictable."
tt3501632,"01:30:19,774","01:30:23,823","I trust you, you betray me, round and round in circles we go."
tt3501632,"01:30:23,823","01:30:30,909","See, life is about growth, about change. But you seem to just wanna stay the same."
tt3501632,"01:30:30,909","01:30:35,970",I guess what I'm trying to say is that you'll always be the God of Mischief...
tt3501632,"01:30:35,970","01:30:39,005",But you could be more.
tt3501632,"01:30:40,020","01:30:42,043",I'll just put this over here for you.
tt3501632,"01:30:42,044","01:30:47,103","Anyway, I've got places to be, so good luck."
tt3501632,"01:30:51,153","01:30:55,210",I can figure this out. It's just another spaceship.
tt3501632,"01:31:07,358","01:31:11,405","Loyal Sakaarians. Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship,"
tt3501632,"01:31:11,406","01:31:16,467","and my favorite champion? Sakaarians, take the skies!"
tt3501632,"01:31:16,467","01:31:20,516",Bring him down. Do not let him leave this planet.
tt3501632,"01:31:32,663","01:31:35,699",- Good shot. - Thanks.
tt3501632,"01:31:36,712","01:31:39,748",- Opening doors. - Okay.
tt3501632,"01:31:44,808","01:31:47,846",- I hope you're tougher than you look! - Why?
tt3501632,"01:31:59,993","01:32:04,041","- Shouldn't we shoot it back or something? - Yes, we should."
tt3501632,"01:32:04,041","01:32:05,061",Where are the guns on this ship?
tt3501632,"01:32:05,062","01:32:12,139",There aren't any. It's a () vessel.
tt3501632,"01:32:12,139","01:32:14,172",Did she just say orgies?
tt3501632,"01:32:14,172","01:32:17,210",Don't touch anything.
tt3501632,"01:32:37,452","01:32:39,477",No!
tt3501632,"01:32:41,502","01:32:43,526",- No! - No!
tt3501632,"01:32:49,601","01:32:53,649",- Get inside! - In a minute!
tt3501632,"01:33:03,770","01:33:05,795","I should probably go to help. Here, take the wheel!"
tt3501632,"01:33:05,795","01:33:08,840","- No, I can't fly one of these! - You're a scientist. Use one of your PhDs."
tt3501632,"01:33:08,840","01:33:13,893",None of them are for fying alien spaceships!
tt3501632,"01:33:48,316","01:33:52,364",There's gotta be a gun on this thing. That looks like a gun.
tt3501632,"01:34:05,524","01:34:07,548",Yeah!
tt3501632,"01:34:23,745","01:34:25,779","Guys, we're coming up on the Devil's Anus."
tt3501632,"01:34:31,853","01:34:35,900",There she is. Our ticket out of here.
tt3501632,"01:34:35,900","01:34:38,937","Hey, what's this?"
tt3501632,"01:34:41,974","01:34:46,022",- Thank you. - Hey man. We're about to jump on this ginormous spaceship.
tt3501632,"01:34:46,022","01:34:50,070","- Do you want to come? - Well, you do seem like..."
tt3501632,"01:34:50,071","01:34:54,119","- You're in desperate need of leadership. - Why, thank you."
tt3501632,"01:34:57,156","01:35:00,192",Here we go!
tt3501632,"01:35:05,253","01:35:07,278",Shit!
tt3501632,"01:35:23,474","01:35:28,535","Asgardians! Some misguided soul,"
tt3501632,"01:35:28,535","01:35:32,593","has stolen the Bifrost sword. Tell us where it is,"
tt3501632,"01:35:32,593","01:35:36,641",or there will be consequences.
tt3501632,"01:35:39,677","01:35:41,703",Bad ones.
tt3501632,"01:35:43,728","01:35:46,765",So?
tt3501632,"01:35:51,826","01:35:54,862",You.
tt3501632,"01:36:00,934","01:36:02,959",Please!
tt3501632,"01:36:29,285","01:36:35,351",Well? Executioner?
tt3501632,"01:36:38,395","01:36:41,433",Wait...!
tt3501632,"01:36:42,445","01:36:45,481",I know where the sword is.
tt3501632,"01:37:26,982","01:37:30,018",I never thought I'd be back here.
tt3501632,"01:37:33,056","01:37:34,076",I thought it'd be a lot nicer.
tt3501632,"01:37:35,079","01:37:38,116","Not that it's not nice. It's, it's on fire."
tt3501632,"01:37:38,116","01:37:40,150","Here, up on the mountains. Heat signatures."
tt3501632,"01:37:40,150","01:37:42,175",People clustered together. She's coming for them.
tt3501632,"01:37:43,178","01:37:45,207",Drop me off at the palace. I'll lure her away.
tt3501632,"01:37:45,207","01:37:47,230",- And get yourself killed? - The people trapped there are all that matters.
tt3501632,"01:37:47,230","01:37:51,270","While I'm dealing with Hela, I need you two to help get them off Asgard."
tt3501632,"01:37:51,271","01:37:55,316",- How are we supposed to do that? - I have a man on the ground.
tt3501632,"01:38:01,376","01:38:03,399",Asgard...
tt3501632,"01:38:05,419","01:38:07,443",She's here.
tt3501632,"01:38:18,559","01:38:22,600","- Now, ship has a gun. - I'll take it from here."
tt3501632,"01:38:22,601","01:38:25,634",I found this in the armory.
tt3501632,"01:38:28,666","01:38:30,687",Good luck.
tt3501632,"01:38:31,696","01:38:33,719",Your Majesty.
tt3501632,"01:38:34,729","01:38:36,751",Don't die.
tt3501632,"01:38:38,771","01:38:40,802",You know what I mean.
tt3501632,"01:39:39,419","01:39:41,440",Keep moving!
tt3501632,"01:39:41,441","01:39:44,473",Go to the Bifrost.
tt3501632,"01:40:24,909","01:40:26,930",Sister.
tt3501632,"01:40:28,951","01:40:30,971",You are still alive.
tt3501632,"01:40:30,971","01:40:32,992",I love what you've done to the place.
tt3501632,"01:40:32,993","01:40:34,005","Redecorating, I see."
tt3501632,"01:40:34,006","01:40:39,175",It seems our father's solution to every problem was to cover it up.
tt3501632,"01:40:39,279","01:40:41,301",Or to cast it out.
tt3501632,"01:40:42,345","01:40:46,396","He told you you were worthy, he said the same thing to me."
tt3501632,"01:40:47,092","01:40:51,135",You see? You never knew him.
tt3501632,"01:40:51,473","01:40:52,493",Not at his best.
tt3501632,"01:40:54,498","01:40:58,550",Odin and I drowned entire civilizations in blood and tears.
tt3501632,"01:40:58,806","01:41:01,838",Where do you think all this gunk came from?
tt3501632,"01:41:01,966","01:41:06,483","And then, one day he decided to become a benevolent king."
tt3501632,"01:41:06,650","01:41:08,673",Fostered peace to protect life.
tt3501632,"01:41:09,824","01:41:11,845",To have you.
tt3501632,"01:41:12,056","01:41:18,118","I understand why you're angry, and as my sister you technically have a claim to the throne..."
tt3501632,"01:41:18,495","01:41:21,527","Believe me, I want someone else to rule. But it can't be you."
tt3501632,"01:41:22,956","01:41:23,968",You're just...
tt3501632,"01:41:24,818","01:41:26,840",Worst.
tt3501632,"01:41:27,609","01:41:29,630",Okay. Get up.
tt3501632,"01:41:29,935","01:41:31,956",You are on my seat.
tt3501632,"01:41:32,381","01:41:37,434","Our father once told me, ""a wise king never seeks out war..."""
tt3501632,"01:41:37,547","01:41:40,580","""But must always be ready for it."""
tt3501632,"01:42:11,175","01:42:13,194",Go back!
tt3501632,"01:42:18,537","01:42:20,558",Go!
tt3501632,"01:42:54,576","01:42:57,606","To be honest, I expected more."
tt3501632,"01:43:00,165","01:43:03,197",Heimdall.
tt3501632,"01:43:03,461","01:43:05,484",The sword!
tt3501632,"01:43:09,741","01:43:13,784",Here's the difference between us. I'm Odin's firstborn. The rightful heir.
tt3501632,"01:43:13,962","01:43:18,003",The savior of Asgard. And you are nothing.
tt3501632,"01:43:28,127","01:43:31,161",So simple. Even a blind man can see it!
tt3501632,"01:43:34,433","01:43:38,473",Now you remind me of dad.
tt3501632,"01:43:46,838","01:43:49,870",This stupid dog won't die!
tt3501632,"01:44:10,695","01:44:12,717","Everything's gonna be alright, Val. I got this."
tt3501632,"01:44:13,374","01:44:15,404",You wanted to know who I am?
tt3501632,"01:44:16,358","01:44:18,380",What the hell are you talking about?

tt4912910,"00:07:35,338","00:07:36,498",What's that?
tt4912910,"00:07:36,499","00:07:38,752",This is a beryllium rod. It's just causing a
tt4912910,"00:07:38,753","00:07:41,447",reaction with the plutonium inside the core.
tt4912910,"00:07:50,434","00:07:51,739",That's that.
tt4912910,"00:07:54,810","00:07:56,115",The money?
tt4912910,"00:07:57,260","00:07:58,565",The money.
tt4912910,"00:08:01,344","00:08:02,649",Bring the money.
tt4912910,"00:08:14,997","00:08:16,693","Luther, bring the money."
tt4912910,"00:08:25,624","00:08:27,874","We're gonna need that money, Luther."
tt4912910,"00:08:28,042","00:08:29,347",Kill them!
tt4912910,"00:08:34,803","00:08:36,108",I've got it!
tt4912910,"00:08:40,643","00:08:42,504","Luther, do you copy? Luther?!"
tt4912910,"00:08:42,777","00:08:44,082","Luther, come in."
tt4912910,"00:08:44,131","00:08:48,073",<i>Luther is not here right now. What can the Apostles do for you...</i>
tt4912910,"00:08:48,542","00:08:50,880",<i>...Hunt?</i> - What do you want?
tt4912910,"00:08:50,994","00:08:53,970","<i>You're not escaping, Hunt. Give us the plutonium.</i>"
tt4912910,"00:08:54,118","00:08:56,871","<i>And walk away.</i> - Benji, get the car!"
tt4912910,"00:08:57,401","00:09:00,821","I don’t think I can do that. - Benji, get the car."
tt4912910,"00:09:21,192","00:09:23,299","We'll make your a deal, Hunt."
tt4912910,"00:09:23,428","00:09:26,726",Give us the plutonium and we won't kill your friend.
tt4912910,"00:09:30,234","00:09:32,595","Don't you do it, Ethan! Not for me!"
tt4912910,"00:09:45,997","00:09:47,469",I'm gonna count to 3.
tt4912910,"00:09:48,227","00:09:49,532",One...
tt4912910,"00:09:50,703","00:09:54,250","Two... - Luther, I'm sorry."
tt4912910,"00:09:54,251","00:09:55,556",Three!
tt4912910,"00:10:09,971","00:10:13,393",I'm sorry. I didn't know what else to do. - We're good.
tt4912910,"00:10:17,264","00:10:19,746",You're OK? - I should be dead.
tt4912910,"00:10:19,844","00:10:21,634",We should all be dead!
tt4912910,"00:10:23,045","00:10:24,350",Why aren't we?
tt4912910,"00:10:25,448","00:10:26,976",Where's the plutonium?
tt4912910,"00:10:39,079","00:10:40,384",It's gone.

tt4912910,"00:12:06,601","00:12:10,406",We know who you are. We read the Manifesto we found in your lab.
tt4912910,"00:12:21,657","00:12:24,562",There has never been peace without first a great suffering.
tt4912910,"00:12:24,563","00:12:27,498","The greater the suffering, the greater the peace."
tt4912910,"00:12:27,499","00:12:29,719","See, this will unite them."
tt4912910,"00:12:31,073","00:12:33,593",When they read this manifesto they'll understand.
tt4912910,"00:12:33,594","00:12:36,121","Nobody's gonna read that manifesto, ever!"
tt4912910,"00:12:36,237","00:12:38,031",I can promise you that.
tt4912910,"00:12:38,304","00:12:41,153",What day is it? How long have I been here?
tt4912910,"00:12:41,227","00:12:43,477",What's the last thing you remember?
tt4912910,"00:12:44,464","00:12:45,769",I was driving...
tt4912910,"00:12:48,780","00:12:51,252",Someone hit me. - That was two weeks ago.
tt4912910,"00:12:51,961","00:12:55,100","Two weeks? - Two weeks. - This is yours, isn't it?"
tt4912910,"00:12:55,366","00:12:57,831",It's how Lark communicated with you.
tt4912910,"00:12:58,209","00:13:01,102",Lark? - John Lark. We know all about him.
tt4912910,"00:13:01,247","00:13:03,989",You know nothing! - It's information in this phone that
tt4912910,"00:13:03,990","00:13:06,837",could lead us to him. And you have the pass-code.
tt4912910,"00:13:06,838","00:13:08,643",You think Lark's the enemy?
tt4912910,"00:13:09,962","00:13:14,813","You, well, who ever you are. You're the enemy."
tt4912910,"00:13:14,814","00:13:19,342",You're why the system survives. Why the suffering goes on! - Shut up!
tt4912910,"00:13:19,343","00:13:21,929",We don't care about you. We want Lark!
tt4912910,"00:13:21,930","00:13:25,147","What if we make a deal? - Nah, There's no deal, Luther."
tt4912910,"00:13:25,148","00:13:26,453",Step outside!
tt4912910,"00:13:27,579","00:13:30,478","Ethan! - Give me 5 minutes with this guy! - Ethan, I can't let you do that."
tt4912910,"00:13:30,479","00:13:33,896",That's not who we are. - Maybe we need to reconsider that!
tt4912910,"00:13:34,341","00:13:37,920",What if they read the manifesto on the air? - What? You can do that?
tt4912910,"00:13:37,921","00:13:40,015",We can do it with a phone call.
tt4912910,"00:13:41,303","00:13:46,494","Well, if he reader Larks manifesto... - No! - I'll give you the pass-code."
tt4912910,"00:13:47,073","00:13:48,732",Ethan! Ethan!
tt4912910,"00:13:49,271","00:13:53,830","Think, Ethan. Think of the greater good. Please! - Yeah, you do that."

tt4912910,"00:14:12,790","00:14:15,244",If we read the manifesto.

tt4912910,"00:17:34,206","00:17:37,627",That phone you unlocked lead us to a server in Iceland but we managed
tt4912910,"00:17:37,628","00:17:41,211",to decrypt the communicate between John Lark and this woman:
tt4912910,"00:17:41,354","00:17:43,711","Alanna Mitsopolis, activist and philanthropist whose"
tt4912910,"00:17:43,712","00:17:46,284",charity work has earned her the nickname the White Widow.
tt4912910,"00:17:46,285","00:17:49,706","It's all a front for her real trade: arms dealing, money laundering."
tt4912910,"00:17:49,707","00:17:52,894",Extensive political connections provide her with protection.
tt4912910,"00:17:52,895","00:17:55,071",Lark and the Widow were meeting tonight to
tt4912910,"00:17:55,072","00:17:57,493",negotiate the delivery of unspecified package.
tt4912910,"00:17:57,494","00:18:00,406",Which we can only assume is our missing plutonium.
tt4912910,"00:18:00,407","00:18:03,215",They'll make contact in the private lounge at the <i>Grand Palais</i> in Paris.
tt4912910,"00:18:03,216","00:18:06,247",During her annual fund-raising event. The details are in the file.
tt4912910,"00:18:06,248","00:18:09,498",If Lark isn't there by midnight the Widow will leave.
tt4912910,"00:18:09,698","00:18:13,154",And sell the package to the highest bidder. Which gives you...
tt4912910,"00:18:13,155","00:18:15,352",...two hours from now to find Lark.
tt4912910,"00:18:15,353","00:18:17,691","Sir, I think there’s something you need to know."
tt4912910,"00:18:17,692","00:18:22,076",I'm gonna stop you right there. You had a terrible choice to make in Berlin.
tt4912910,"00:18:22,077","00:18:24,301",Recover the plutonium or save your team.
tt4912910,"00:18:24,302","00:18:27,052",You chose your team and now the world's at risk.
tt4912910,"00:18:27,053","00:18:29,872","Some flaw, deep within your core being simply won't"

tt4912910,"00:18:37,694","00:18:40,702",It also tells me I can count on you to cover my ass.
tt4912910,"00:18:40,703","00:18:43,783",Because coming here from <i>CIA</i> was a lateral move. Some say a step down.
tt4912910,"00:18:43,784","00:18:46,994",But I did it because of you.
tt4912910,"00:18:47,924","00:18:49,563",Don't make me regret it.
tt4912910,"00:19:01,746","00:19:03,051",Make the call.
tt4912910,"00:19:06,592","00:19:07,897",Shut them down.

tt4912910,"00:19:20,044","00:19:23,688",It may be your mission but this is the <i>CIA</i>- s plane.
tt4912910,"00:19:23,727","00:19:26,400",It doesn't take off without my say-so. - We don't have time for this.
tt4912910,"00:19:26,401","00:19:30,083",I have a team in Paris ready to grab Lark as soon as he gets to <i>Palais</i>.
tt4912910,"00:19:31,084","00:19:35,408",A <i>G5</i> standing by to rendition him to <i>GITMO</i> where waterboard is waiting.
tt4912910,"00:19:35,409","00:19:38,412",Spend 24 hours we don’t have to pull a confession we can't
tt4912910,"00:19:38,413","00:19:41,440",trust from a man we haven't positively identified?
tt4912910,"00:19:41,497","00:19:45,071",No. We need reliable intelligence and we need it now.
tt4912910,"00:19:45,268","00:19:47,792",This scenario is precisely why the <i>IMF</i> exists!
tt4912910,"00:19:47,793","00:19:53,231","The <i>IMF</i> is <i>Halloween</i>, Alan. Bunch of grown men in rubber masks playing <i>Trick or treat</i>."

tt4912910,"00:19:56,340","00:19:58,812",we wouldn't be having this conversation.
tt4912910,"00:19:58,924","00:20:02,026","And his team would be dead. - Yes, they would."
tt4912910,"00:20:02,248","00:20:05,390",That's the job. And that's why I want one of my

tt4912910,"00:20:24,527","00:20:27,555",I have already and he agrees with me. My man goes.
tt4912910,"00:20:27,862","00:20:30,155",Or no one goes.
tt4912910,"00:20:37,901","00:20:40,242",No one comes between you and that plutonium.
tt4912910,"00:20:40,243","00:20:43,450","Not Hunt, not his team, not anyone."
tt4912910,"00:21:02,222","00:21:04,867",The White Widow has spies in every level of government.
tt4912910,"00:21:04,868","00:21:09,673",This plain is posing as commercial airliner so we can jump into France undetected.
tt4912910,"00:21:09,852","00:21:12,718",Widow’s meeting Lark in a <i>VIP</i> lounge at midnight.
tt4912910,"00:21:12,719","00:21:16,256",No one can be a bidder without a pre-issued electronic <i>ID</i> band.
tt4912910,"00:21:16,257","00:21:20,725",We've acquired the unique <i>RFID</i> number for Larks band allowing us to locate it...
tt4912910,"00:21:20,726","00:21:24,988","...with these. Find that <i>ID</i> band, you'll find Lark."
tt4912910,"00:21:25,672","00:21:26,977",Then what?
tt4912910,"00:21:28,952","00:21:30,257",Then...
tt4912910,"00:21:31,633","00:21:36,384",I assume his identity. Make contact with the Widow. She takes us to the package.
tt4912910,"00:21:37,602","00:21:39,796",People actually fall for this shit?
tt4912910,"00:21:40,993","00:21:43,521",How do you intend to make Lark cooperate?
tt4912910,"00:21:45,380","00:21:47,451",I bump him in the crowd.
tt4912910,"00:21:47,801","00:21:50,075",In 10 seconds he'll look like any other drunk at the party.
tt4912910,"00:21:50,076","00:21:52,496","Incoherent, completely pliable."
tt4912910,"00:21:52,497","00:21:54,821",After I borrow his face you walk him out the front door
tt4912910,"00:21:54,822","00:21:56,894",and hand him over to Sloans extraction team.
tt4912910,"00:21:56,895","00:22:00,270","You're not getting rid of me that easily, Hunt. - That's not what this is about."
tt4912910,"00:22:00,271","00:22:02,443",Sure it is.
tt4912910,"00:22:02,558","00:22:05,030",I know you don't want me on this detail.
tt4912910,"00:22:05,108","00:22:06,479",But let's face it.
tt4912910,"00:22:06,753","00:22:10,388",If you made the hard choice in Berlin I wouldn't be here.
tt4912910,"00:22:10,606","00:22:14,051",If you hadn't gun down your <i>Syndicate</i> agent they sent you to find
tt4912910,"00:22:14,052","00:22:15,581",I wouldn't be here.
tt4912910,"00:22:16,372","00:22:17,794",That's right. I know all about you.
tt4912910,"00:22:17,795","00:22:22,664",You're why we don't have living witness who can identify John Lark. Or the Apostles.
tt4912910,"00:22:22,665","00:22:26,659",If you have a problem with my methods you can always stay behind.
tt4912910,"00:22:27,191","00:22:32,352","Your mission, should you choose to accept it. Isn't that the thing?"
tt4912910,"00:22:34,449","00:22:36,456",<i>Two minutes to decompression.</i>
tt4912910,"00:22:36,516","00:22:37,803",Suite up!
tt4912910,"00:22:37,804","00:22:40,508",The Widow is meeting Lark in 30 minutes.
tt4912910,"00:22:56,699","00:22:58,666",<i>10 seconds to decompression.</i>
tt4912910,"00:23:02,101","00:23:03,792",Is your oxygen on?
tt4912910,"00:23:05,625","00:23:10,097",There's no atmosphere at this altitude. I don't need you blacking out on me.
tt4912910,"00:23:12,580","00:23:16,150","Hey, your heads up display has built-in guidance system. Follow it to the target."
tt4912910,"00:23:16,151","00:23:20,345","Open your shoot when the system says. Not before, definitely not after."
tt4912910,"00:23:20,392","00:23:23,763",Or the last thing that goes trough your mind will be your kneecaps. Is that clear?
tt4912910,"00:23:23,764","00:23:25,069",Crystal.
tt4912910,"00:23:47,539","00:23:49,709",We gotta talk. Need to rethink this.
tt4912910,"00:23:49,710","00:23:53,713","Out of my way, Hunt! - Walker, we have a problem. There's a storm and we need to..."
tt4912910,"00:23:53,714","00:23:56,402",Enough talk. I'll see you in Paris!
tt4912910,"00:23:56,774","00:23:58,079",Shit!
tt4912910,"00:24:02,570","00:24:03,875",Come on! Come on!
tt4912910,"00:24:17,272","00:24:20,140","<i>Altitude, 25000 feet.</i>"
tt4912910,"00:24:26,495","00:24:30,189","<i>Walker! - What's the matter, Hunt? Afraid of a little lighting?</i>"
tt4912910,"00:24:39,451","00:24:42,054","<i>Altitude, 20000 feet.</i>"
tt4912910,"00:24:42,385","00:24:43,690",<i>Son of a bitch!</i>
tt4912910,"00:24:45,060","00:24:46,365",<i>Walker?</i>
tt4912910,"00:24:48,296","00:24:49,601",<i>Do you copy?</i>
tt4912910,"00:24:51,099","00:24:52,404",<i>Walker?</i>
tt4912910,"00:24:54,565","00:24:56,817",<i>Hang on. Hang on.</i>
tt4912910,"00:24:57,461","00:24:58,766",<i>Walker?</i>
tt4912910,"00:25:05,092","00:25:06,092",<i>Come on!</i>
tt4912910,"00:25:06,093","00:25:08,726","<i>Altitude, 15000 feet.</i>"
tt4912910,"00:25:12,116","00:25:13,421",<i>Walker?</i>
tt4912910,"00:25:14,036","00:25:15,341",<i>Walker?!</i>
tt4912910,"00:25:26,243","00:25:27,548",<i>Walker!</i>
tt4912910,"00:25:28,400","00:25:29,705",<i>Walker!</i>
tt4912910,"00:25:29,791","00:25:32,565","<i>Altitude, 10000 feet.</i>"
tt4912910,"00:25:36,003","00:25:37,280",<i>9000.</i>
tt4912910,"00:25:37,281","00:25:38,586",<i>Shit!</i>
tt4912910,"00:25:40,927","00:25:42,232",<i>8000.</i>
tt4912910,"00:25:45,136","00:25:46,441",<i>7000.</i>
tt4912910,"00:25:50,269","00:25:51,574",<i>6000.</i>
tt4912910,"00:25:54,861","00:25:56,166",<i>5000.</i>
tt4912910,"00:25:59,322","00:26:00,599",<i>4000.</i>
tt4912910,"00:26:00,600","00:26:01,852",<i>Walker!</i>
tt4912910,"00:26:01,853","00:26:03,158",<i>Walker!</i>
tt4912910,"00:26:04,072","00:26:05,091",<i>3000.</i>
tt4912910,"00:26:05,092","00:26:10,189",<i>Deploy! Deploy! Deploy!</i>
tt4912910,"00:26:25,300","00:26:26,910","Oh, God!"
tt4912910,"00:26:48,093","00:26:50,176",Looks like you lost your oxygen.
tt4912910,"00:27:12,790","00:27:15,262",That's where the Widow is meeting Lark.
tt4912910,"00:27:59,214","00:28:00,829",Walker!
tt4912910,"00:28:03,255","00:28:04,560",Say again?
tt4912910,"00:30:01,788","00:30:03,682",The needle? - Didn't need it.
tt4912910,"00:30:04,614","00:30:05,919",Get him up!
tt4912910,"00:30:55,312","00:30:57,466","<i>Do not be shy. The more, the better.</i>"
tt4912910,"00:30:57,467","00:31:02,066","<i>Come on, we're not bad. - Can we join in? We don't bite.</i>"
tt4912910,"00:32:57,494","00:32:58,799",Shit.
tt4912910,"00:33:18,198","00:33:21,377",Can you still make a mask? - I need a face to make a mask.
tt4912910,"00:33:21,378","00:33:22,683",Sorry.
tt4912910,"00:33:22,797","00:33:24,602",I was aiming for his chest.
tt4912910,"00:33:26,551","00:33:28,458",What are you doing here? - It's good to see you too.
tt4912910,"00:33:28,459","00:33:30,800","Sorry, I'm confused. You're?"
tt4912910,"00:33:33,276","00:33:34,581",An old friend.
tt4912910,"00:33:47,566","00:33:50,062",Cancel extraction. We're code Blue.
tt4912910,"00:33:50,320","00:33:52,577",Send sanitation.
tt4912910,"00:33:52,939","00:33:54,920",That was my team.
tt4912910,"00:33:56,593","00:33:59,898",You didn't answer my question. What are you doing here?
tt4912910,"00:34:02,216","00:34:04,220",That's it. Just take it easy. That's it.
tt4912910,"00:34:04,221","00:34:06,199",Just keep your head back until the bleeding stops.
tt4912910,"00:34:06,200","00:34:09,794",What is it?! <i>You want some?!</i>
tt4912910,"00:34:11,540","00:34:14,093",You're not here by accident. Who sent you?
tt4912910,"00:34:14,094","00:34:16,288",I can't tell you that. - What are you doing?
tt4912910,"00:34:16,289","00:34:19,049",I have a date with White Widow. - He had a date with the Widow.
tt4912910,"00:34:19,050","00:34:22,859","You look nothing like him. - Now, we have to hope they never met."
tt4912910,"00:34:22,860","00:34:25,810",Hope is not a strategy! - You must be new.
tt4912910,"00:34:26,180","00:34:28,972",I have no other choice. White Widow is our only lead.
tt4912910,"00:34:28,973","00:34:31,162",I got to be this guy for 5 minutes. - Don't do it.
tt4912910,"00:34:31,163","00:34:34,239",What? What is it?
tt4912910,"00:34:34,561","00:34:36,933",What aren't you telling me? - You don't understand what you're involved in.
tt4912910,"00:34:36,934","00:34:41,739",I don't understand what I'm involved in? I don't understand what I'm involved in?!
tt4912910,"00:34:43,935","00:34:48,463",What am I involved in? - If you're meeting the Widow she leaves in 3 minutes.
tt4912910,"00:34:49,935","00:34:51,424",Ethan! - I'll make it work.
tt4912910,"00:34:51,425","00:34:53,797",Ethan! - I'll make it work!
tt4912910,"00:34:55,951","00:34:59,433",Name's Walker. - Yeah? You're welcome.
tt4912910,"00:35:18,842","00:35:20,837",What do you think you're doing? - I'm going with you.
tt4912910,"00:35:20,838","00:35:22,955",Like hell you are! - People have been sent here to kill Lark.
tt4912910,"00:35:22,956","00:35:26,075","No shit. - No, not me, contractors. Paid assassins."
tt4912910,"00:35:26,296","00:35:27,540",They don't know what he looks like.
tt4912910,"00:35:27,541","00:35:29,215",They only know he's meeting the Widow at midnight.
tt4912910,"00:35:29,216","00:35:31,363",If you go trough with this they're gonna believe you're Lark
tt4912910,"00:35:31,364","00:35:33,095",and they're gonna kill you.
tt4912910,"00:35:33,096","00:35:35,023",How do you know all of this?
tt4912910,"00:35:36,154","00:35:37,710",I can't tell you that.
tt4912910,"00:35:40,226","00:35:42,531",You should've stayed out of the game.
tt4912910,"00:35:44,338","00:35:46,451",You should've come with me.
tt4912910,"00:35:54,815","00:35:58,044",This charity was started in honor of my mother.
tt4912910,"00:35:59,118","00:36:01,767",Those of you who knew her understood her strength.
tt4912910,"00:36:01,768","00:36:04,953",Her tenacity. Her resourcefulness.
tt4912910,"00:36:06,146","00:36:08,533",But there was another side to her.
tt4912910,"00:36:08,966","00:36:11,249",The side most people never saw.
tt4912910,"00:36:11,484","00:36:16,234",It's that part of her spirit that has brought us all together tonight.
tt4912910,"00:36:17,292","00:36:20,175",Max was something of a paradox.
tt4912910,"00:36:22,568","00:36:25,615",She had a fascination for paradoxes.
tt4912910,"00:36:25,908","00:36:28,734",A fascination she passed onto me.
tt4912910,"00:36:30,664","00:36:34,784",Max had no illusions about the world we live in today.
tt4912910,"00:36:35,384","00:36:38,817",But she had dreams of a very different future.
tt4912910,"00:36:39,528","00:36:43,240",One in which her unique talents were no longer required.
tt4912910,"00:36:43,857","00:36:46,500",All she earned from the way the world is
tt4912910,"00:36:46,501","00:36:50,045",went ultimately to making it what it could someday be.
tt4912910,"00:36:51,013","00:36:53,570",That future isn't here yet.
tt4912910,"00:36:54,763","00:36:59,587",Tonight your contributions have brought it just a little closer.
tt4912910,"00:37:03,074","00:37:06,518",Go with the opportunity. Enjoy the party.
tt4912910,"00:37:26,787","00:37:30,015",You can't possibly be John Lark?
tt4912910,"00:37:33,514","00:37:35,655","I'm not, actually."
tt4912910,"00:37:36,485","00:37:38,812",It's an alias.
tt4912910,"00:37:40,462","00:37:43,801",I suppose it's better than John Doe. Is there another name you prefer?
tt4912910,"00:37:43,802","00:37:48,078",Is there somewhere we can talk privately? - I like Lark. It has a certain ring.
tt4912910,"00:37:48,079","00:37:50,803",We don't have a lot of time. - I'll be honest with you.
tt4912910,"00:37:50,804","00:37:53,869",A man with your reputation. I was expecting someone...
tt4912910,"00:37:53,870","00:37:56,168",...uglier.
tt4912910,"00:37:56,389","00:37:59,893",Don't let looks deceive because I'm as ugly as they come. Now I'll be honest with you.
tt4912910,"00:37:59,894","00:38:02,406",Your life's in danger.
tt4912910,"00:38:03,111","00:38:06,464","Don't you touch her. - Relax, he's my brother."
tt4912910,"00:38:07,363","00:38:09,670","You're being rude to our guest, Zola."
tt4912910,"00:38:09,671","00:38:10,976",It's time to go.
tt4912910,"00:38:11,327","00:38:13,319",Don't turn this into a scene.
tt4912910,"00:38:15,321","00:38:17,236",You don't leave this room.
tt4912910,"00:38:23,608","00:38:26,241",You see? - Your life's in danger.
tt4912910,"00:38:27,033","00:38:30,338",And who'd want to kill me? - The Americans for starters.
tt4912910,"00:38:30,494","00:38:34,744",Duly noted. - You think you're the only one with spies in the government?
tt4912910,"00:38:34,852","00:38:38,056",There are people here who don't want this meeting to happen.
tt4912910,"00:38:38,057","00:38:39,898",Don't believe me?
tt4912910,"00:38:40,134","00:38:41,835",Look around.
tt4912910,"00:38:53,684","00:38:55,551",I know what you're thinking.
tt4912910,"00:38:55,904","00:38:59,654",Maybe they're not here for you. Maybe they're just here for me.
tt4912910,"00:38:59,868","00:39:02,216",Are you willing to take that chance?
tt4912910,"00:39:02,810","00:39:04,966",You have something I want.
tt4912910,"00:39:05,063","00:39:09,687",Right now that makes me the only person you can trust to get you out of here alive.
tt4912910,"00:39:09,688","00:39:12,549",Or would you rather leave that to your brother?
tt4912910,"00:39:16,592","00:39:19,742","I think I'd like to go home now, Mr. Lark."
tt4912910,"00:41:35,140","00:41:38,084",The French government will receive the asset they took in today.
tt4912910,"00:41:38,085","00:41:41,981",Delivery will be by air to the finance ministry at 8:00 AM tomorrow morning.
tt4912910,"00:41:41,982","00:41:46,038",Another motorcade under heavy police escort will transport him on along this root.
tt4912910,"00:41:46,039","00:41:49,687",We'll create a diversion at this intersection. Here.
tt4912910,"00:41:49,688","00:41:53,882","Motorcade will automatically take the pre-planned alternate root, here."
tt4912910,"00:41:53,906","00:41:55,878",Where we'll extract the asset.
tt4912910,"00:41:56,803","00:41:59,236",Extract the asset?
tt4912910,"00:42:10,203","00:42:11,508",The asset?
tt4912910,"00:42:13,694","00:42:16,317",We've payed a great deal of money for this information.
tt4912910,"00:42:16,318","00:42:18,957",They gave us everything but this mans name.
tt4912910,"00:42:19,433","00:42:22,072","You don't happen to know who he is, do you?"
tt4912910,"00:42:22,802","00:42:26,663",His name is Solomon Lane. British special agent turned anarchist.
tt4912910,"00:42:28,388","00:42:33,082",He used rogue covert operatives to create a terror network called the Syndicate.
tt4912910,"00:42:34,035","00:42:37,012","Sabotage, assassination, mass murder..."
tt4912910,"00:42:37,316","00:42:39,649",Ugly as they come.
tt4912910,"00:42:39,994","00:42:42,974",He was captured by American agents two years ago.
tt4912910,"00:42:43,454","00:42:46,622",Since then he's been under never-ending interrogation.
tt4912910,"00:42:46,623","00:42:49,438",Passed around from one government to another.
tt4912910,"00:42:50,230","00:42:52,430",To answer for his crimes.
tt4912910,"00:42:55,208","00:42:57,547","You seem displeased, Lark?"
tt4912910,"00:42:57,563","00:43:00,543",Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.
tt4912910,"00:43:01,133","00:43:03,892",I came to Paris for plutonium.
tt4912910,"00:43:03,893","00:43:06,417","Well, there must be a misunderstanding."
tt4912910,"00:43:06,534","00:43:10,582",I'm just a broker. I connect a buyer and a seller.
tt4912910,"00:43:11,019","00:43:14,991",My seller isn't interested in cash. So if you want the plutonium...
tt4912910,"00:43:15,739","00:43:19,368",Extract Lane and make a trade.
tt4912910,"00:43:20,203","00:43:21,508",That's right.
tt4912910,"00:43:26,196","00:43:28,779",How do I know the seller has what I want.
tt4912910,"00:43:47,683","00:43:49,544",A down-payment in good faith.
tt4912910,"00:43:50,447","00:43:53,745",The Currier we'll deliver two more within 48 hours.
tt4912910,"00:43:53,746","00:43:57,224",In exchange for him.
tt4912910,"00:44:04,894","00:44:06,199",All right.
tt4912910,"00:44:06,287","00:44:08,350",What happens after diversion?
tt4912910,"00:45:42,075","00:45:43,380",Kill everyone?
tt4912910,"00:45:43,920","00:45:45,225",That's your plan?
tt4912910,"00:45:45,467","00:45:47,494",There'll be no witnesses.
tt4912910,"00:45:47,749","00:45:50,739",What's my guarantee that Lane walks out of this thing alive?
tt4912910,"00:45:50,740","00:45:52,514",He's in an armored box.
tt4912910,"00:45:52,870","00:45:55,009",We'll pull him out when it's safe.
tt4912910,"00:45:55,431","00:45:57,374",You want your plutonium?
tt4912910,"00:45:57,401","00:45:59,307",This is the price.
tt4912910,"00:46:01,061","00:46:03,533",Or do you draw the line at killing cops?
tt4912910,"00:46:03,667","00:46:05,927",That's John Lark you're talking to.
tt4912910,"00:46:08,695","00:46:11,869",I've murdered women and children with smallpox.
tt4912910,"00:46:14,177","00:46:16,117",I have no line.
tt4912910,"00:46:20,267","00:46:21,572",Right.
tt4912910,"00:46:21,673","00:46:24,765","Sleep well, everyone. Busy day tomorrow."
tt4912910,"00:46:45,024","00:46:47,044",You have got to be kidding me?
tt4912910,"00:46:47,196","00:46:50,011",If you want Lane out of prison this is how he gets out.
tt4912910,"00:46:50,012","00:46:52,730","I wanted Lark to brake him out, not Ethan Hunt."
tt4912910,"00:46:52,731","00:46:56,925","I wanted Lark at the exchange, not Ethan Hunt."
tt4912910,"00:46:57,207","00:47:01,512",I wanted Lark to lead us to the plutonium and the Apostles.
tt4912910,"00:47:02,182","00:47:03,881",You may still get your chance.
tt4912910,"00:47:03,882","00:47:06,347",Have you forgotten about the corpse we pulled out of men's room
tt4912910,"00:47:06,348","00:47:09,085",at the <i>Grand Palais</i>? - I'm guessing that wasn't Lark.
tt4912910,"00:47:09,086","00:47:13,025",More likely one of Larks recruits. - Not according to our intelligence.
tt4912910,"00:47:13,026","00:47:14,998",Intelligence gathered by whom?
tt4912910,"00:47:17,275","00:47:18,580",Hunt.
tt4912910,"00:47:19,415","00:47:22,832",You long held suspicions that Lark was an American agent.
tt4912910,"00:47:22,863","00:47:27,335",Someone who knew our every move. Someone who could come and go like a ghost.
tt4912910,"00:47:28,305","00:47:31,343",You're suggesting Hunt is John Lark?
tt4912910,"00:47:32,054","00:47:36,171","You're reaching, Walker. Trying to save your ass."
tt4912910,"00:47:36,476","00:47:37,781",It won't work.
tt4912910,"00:47:38,132","00:47:43,197",Think about it. Would a man as careful as Lark really stick his neck out like that?
tt4912910,"00:47:43,392","00:47:45,975",For a face to face with the White Widow?
tt4912910,"00:47:46,005","00:47:48,630",He'd send a proxy. - A decoy.
tt4912910,"00:47:48,696","00:47:51,516",If he was really smart he'd had his lady friend
tt4912910,"00:47:51,517","00:47:54,617",kill that decoy in front of a reliable witness.
tt4912910,"00:47:55,134","00:47:56,439",Me.
tt4912910,"00:47:56,653","00:47:59,930",The dragnet is closing down on his terrorist alter-ego.
tt4912910,"00:47:59,931","00:48:03,992",So he pays a man to play the part of Lark and has him killed.
tt4912910,"00:48:04,548","00:48:06,846",And under the guise of serving his country...
tt4912910,"00:48:06,847","00:48:10,074",Assumes his own secret identity.
tt4912910,"00:48:10,092","00:48:14,175",Free to operate at will with the full support of US government. - Why?
tt4912910,"00:48:14,808","00:48:16,758",Why would Hunt turn?
tt4912910,"00:48:17,232","00:48:20,364",Why did Lane do it? Why did any of his Apostles?
tt4912910,"00:48:20,759","00:48:23,910",They were believers in a cause.
tt4912910,"00:48:24,281","00:48:28,809",And when that cause turned out to be a lie they turned against their masters.
tt4912910,"00:48:28,959","00:48:31,741","How many times has Hunts government betrayed him,"
tt4912910,"00:48:31,742","00:48:34,375","disavowed him, casted him aside?"
tt4912910,"00:48:34,508","00:48:38,676",And how long before a man like that has had enough?
tt4912910,"00:48:39,726","00:48:42,473",That is a serious accusation.
tt4912910,"00:48:44,068","00:48:45,605",Can you prove it?
tt4912910,"00:48:49,466","00:48:53,327",This is the phone we pulled of the dead body at the <i>Grand Palais</i>.
tt4912910,"00:48:58,053","00:49:00,692",I'm guessing it has all the proof you need.
tt4912910,"00:51:04,626","00:51:07,598",Is it true Lane gassed a village of 2000 people?
tt4912910,"00:51:09,902","00:51:10,902",Yes.
tt4912910,"00:51:10,903","00:51:15,208",Is it true he brought down an entire passenger plane just to kill one man?
tt4912910,"00:51:15,923","00:51:17,228",Yes.
tt4912910,"00:51:18,292","00:51:21,303","Is it true that he... - Walker, whatever you heard."
tt4912910,"00:51:21,304","00:51:24,477","If it makes your skin crawl, it's probably true."
tt4912910,"00:51:31,336","00:51:32,641",Holy shit!
tt4912910,"00:51:34,349","00:51:36,988","You're the guy that caught him, aren't you?"
tt4912910,"00:51:38,584","00:51:41,834",How long do you think he's gonna keep that to himself?
tt4912910,"00:51:45,269","00:51:47,797",We'll burn that bridge when we get to it.
tt4912910,"00:52:37,237","00:52:38,542",Close it.
tt4912910,"00:54:15,670","00:54:17,458",What the hell is he doing?
tt4912910,"00:55:48,568","00:55:50,791",<i>NO SIGNAL</i>
tt4912910,"00:56:30,673","00:56:33,145","Hunt, <i>where are you?</i> - Don't wait for me!"
tt4912910,"00:56:34,014","00:56:35,715",<i>Wanna do... What's wrong?</i>
tt4912910,"00:56:37,070","00:56:39,551",I'll meet you at the garage!
tt4912910,"00:56:48,046","00:56:49,718","Benji, do you copy?!"
tt4912910,"00:56:49,910","00:56:54,095",We copy. Go.<i> - Change of plan. I'm glued. Need extraction!</i>
tt4912910,"00:56:54,388","00:56:55,693",We're on our way!
tt4912910,"00:57:10,434","00:57:12,510",<i>He's driving from Notre Dame to the Saint</i>
tt4912910,"00:57:12,511","00:57:15,261",<i>Louis bridge. Police patrols are chasing him.</i>
tt4912910,"01:01:35,953","01:01:37,258",<i>STOP!</i>
tt4912910,"01:01:37,423","01:01:39,036",<i>Stay where you are!</i>
tt4912910,"01:01:41,384","01:01:42,689",Get in the car.
tt4912910,"01:01:43,278","01:01:44,583",<i>Nobody move!</i>
tt4912910,"01:01:47,835","01:01:49,196",<i>Show me your hands!</i>
tt4912910,"01:01:51,068","01:01:53,252","<i>Go away, please.</i>"
tt4912910,"01:01:53,340","01:01:55,237",<i>Show me your hands!</i>
tt4912910,"01:01:59,049","01:02:00,993","<i>Don’t worry, please.</i>"
tt4912910,"01:02:01,318","01:02:04,029","<i>Go away, please.</i>"
tt4912910,"01:02:04,975","01:02:07,185","<i>Go away, please.</i>"
tt4912910,"01:02:13,044","01:02:15,181",Zola wants a word with you.
tt4912910,"01:02:19,040","01:02:21,543",<i>What do we do with her? - Kill her.</i>
tt4912910,"01:02:52,002","01:02:53,571",<i>You will be fine.</i>
tt4912910,"01:03:00,233","01:03:01,841",<i>You will be fine.</i>
tt4912910,"01:03:01,893","01:03:03,198",We gotta go!
tt4912910,"01:03:04,216","01:03:06,452",<i>I am so sorry.</i> - Come on!
tt4912910,"01:03:43,663","01:03:45,314",The name's Walker by the way.
tt4912910,"01:03:45,315","01:03:47,479",Was the little car your idea?
tt4912910,"01:03:57,666","01:03:58,971",Jesus Christ!
tt4912910,"01:03:59,732","01:04:01,936",What the hell was that?!
tt4912910,"01:04:07,540","01:04:09,622","Everybody, out! - Go, go, go!"
tt4912910,"01:06:47,173","01:06:48,478",That was Ilsa.
tt4912910,"01:06:48,770","01:06:50,075",Shut up!
tt4912910,"01:06:50,508","01:06:51,813",Very interesting.
tt4912910,"01:06:55,628","01:06:58,058","It's good to see you again, Ethan."
tt4912910,"01:07:35,573","01:07:37,717",Look who's still alive.
tt4912910,"01:07:41,472","01:07:44,944",There's a microwave tracker in his neck. - OK. You know what to do.
tt4912910,"01:07:44,945","01:07:48,472",Let me just assure you this won't hurt... enough.
tt4912910,"01:07:50,764","01:07:52,069",90 seconds.
tt4912910,"01:07:53,307","01:07:57,135",You and the Apostles think we're gonna trade you for the missing plutonium.
tt4912910,"01:07:57,136","01:07:59,784",I'm here to tell you that's never gonna happen.
tt4912910,"01:07:59,785","01:08:02,768","Your mission, should you choose to accept it..."
tt4912910,"01:08:04,150","01:08:07,656","I wander, Ethan, did you ever choose not to?"
tt4912910,"01:08:08,331","01:08:12,487",Did you ever stop and ask yourself who's giving you the orders or why?
tt4912910,"01:08:13,547","01:08:18,129",When everyday the master you serve is one step closer to ending the world.
tt4912910,"01:08:18,191","01:08:20,600",Strange accusation coming from a terrorist.
tt4912910,"01:08:20,601","01:08:23,495","60 seconds. - Terrorists are schoolboys, desperate for attention."
tt4912910,"01:08:23,496","01:08:26,776",Hoping to shape public opinion trough fear.
tt4912910,"01:08:27,496","01:08:30,699",I don't care in the least what people think or feel.
tt4912910,"01:08:31,085","01:08:33,910",In my experience they don't do either for very long.
tt4912910,"01:08:33,911","01:08:37,825",I suppose that justifies bombing factories or bringing down civilian aircraft.
tt4912910,"01:08:37,826","01:08:40,076",Or strapping me into explosive vest!
tt4912910,"01:08:40,253","01:08:43,561","Consider it unfinished business, my funny little friend."
tt4912910,"01:08:43,562","01:08:45,034",Luther? - Almost there.
tt4912910,"01:08:45,142","01:08:47,443","You see the end as clearly as I do, Ethan."
tt4912910,"01:08:47,444","01:08:50,615",Governments the world over are descending into madness.
tt4912910,"01:08:50,616","01:08:54,764",The Syndicate was created to tear them down. Brick by brick.
tt4912910,"01:08:54,765","01:08:56,646",The Syndicate was a pack of murdering cowards!
tt4912910,"01:08:56,647","01:08:59,599",The Syndicate was civilizations last hope!
tt4912910,"01:09:00,172","01:09:03,343",A chance to smash the old world order.
tt4912910,"01:09:04,137","01:09:08,859",That hope is gone now because of you and your pathetic morality.
tt4912910,"01:09:10,774","01:09:13,220","You should have killed me, Ethan."
tt4912910,"01:09:15,277","01:09:19,112","The end you always feared, it's coming."
tt4912910,"01:09:21,999","01:09:24,288",It's coming.
tt4912910,"01:09:24,915","01:09:27,834",And her blood will be on your hands.
tt4912910,"01:09:30,182","01:09:34,925",The fallout. For all your good intentions.
tt4912910,"01:09:41,681","01:09:43,944",Time! - Got it!
tt4912910,"01:10:08,526","01:10:09,831",Get him up!
tt4912910,"01:10:12,518","01:10:13,823",You're mine now!
tt4912910,"01:10:23,030","01:10:27,831","You're just full of surprises, Lark. - Your brothers plan was bad from the word <i>go</i>."
tt4912910,"01:10:27,832","01:10:31,804",You'd lost all your men and Lane would've been killed in crossfire.
tt4912910,"01:10:32,301","01:10:34,060",I had to improvise.
tt4912910,"01:10:34,753","01:10:37,003",Why not say that in the first place?
tt4912910,"01:10:37,302","01:10:41,052",Because I don't trust your people. Especially not your brother.
tt4912910,"01:10:45,049","01:10:46,354","Family,"
tt4912910,"01:10:46,499","01:10:48,418",what can you do?
tt4912910,"01:10:50,931","01:10:52,887",So where's Lane?
tt4912910,"01:10:53,146","01:10:55,671",Certainly not at the bottom of the Seine.
tt4912910,"01:10:55,672","01:10:57,642",I have him. He's safe.
tt4912910,"01:10:58,094","01:11:00,090",Where do I meet the Currier?
tt4912910,"01:11:01,500","01:11:03,462",Let's talk about the woman.
tt4912910,"01:11:05,132","01:11:06,437",Woman?
tt4912910,"01:11:06,468","01:11:09,567",She was with you at the <i>Palais</i>. Zola saw her again today.
tt4912910,"01:11:09,568","01:11:13,596",She tried to kill Lane. She had a chance to kill you but she didn't.
tt4912910,"01:11:13,974","01:11:15,279",Why?
tt4912910,"01:11:18,730","01:11:20,577",We have a past.
tt4912910,"01:11:21,612","01:11:22,917",It's complicated.
tt4912910,"01:11:24,922","01:11:27,616","Well, I'll make it more complicated for you."
tt4912910,"01:11:27,799","01:11:29,610",My price just went up.
tt4912910,"01:11:30,059","01:11:33,476",Someone killed four of my men today. I assume it was her.
tt4912910,"01:11:40,279","01:11:42,074","I want her, Lark."
tt4912910,"01:11:42,813","01:11:44,896",And you're gonna bring her to me.
tt4912910,"01:11:45,834","01:11:50,639",Otherwise you don't meet the Currier and the plutonium goes to the highest bidder.
tt4912910,"01:11:51,171","01:11:53,616",I'd hate for her to come between us.
tt4912910,"01:11:57,937","01:11:59,242",She's yours.
tt4912910,"01:12:00,224","01:12:02,711",At the meeting. Not before.
tt4912910,"01:12:14,927","01:12:16,596",Go to London.
tt4912910,"01:12:17,255","01:12:19,241",Instructions will follow.
tt4912910,"01:14:00,890","01:14:03,684",I knew if I followed her you'd show up eventually.
tt4912910,"01:14:03,685","01:14:04,990",You OK?
tt4912910,"01:14:07,786","01:14:10,703","Ilsa, I'd never... - I know you had your reasons."
tt4912910,"01:14:11,727","01:14:13,032",I know.
tt4912910,"01:14:16,963","01:14:19,841",You need to walk away. - I can't do that.
tt4912910,"01:14:21,483","01:14:23,900",You weren't at the <i>Palais</i> to kill Lark.
tt4912910,"01:14:24,050","01:14:25,355",No.
tt4912910,"01:14:27,082","01:14:29,054",You were there to protect him.
tt4912910,"01:14:29,266","01:14:30,571",Yes.
tt4912910,"01:14:30,743","01:14:33,098",And you killed him to protect me.
tt4912910,"01:14:34,691","01:14:37,230",You wanted Lark to break Lane out.
tt4912910,"01:14:38,575","01:14:41,514","No, you needed him to break Lane out."
tt4912910,"01:14:42,585","01:14:44,641",Because you have to kill Lane.
tt4912910,"01:14:46,115","01:14:47,870",Who's making you do this?
tt4912910,"01:14:49,650","01:14:51,694",<i>MI6</i>.
tt4912910,"01:14:53,970","01:14:55,225",Why?
tt4912910,"01:14:55,226","01:14:57,548",After we captured him in London they tried to
tt4912910,"01:14:57,549","01:15:00,188",bring Lane home trough diplomatic channels.
tt4912910,"01:15:00,278","01:15:03,054",But too many countries won't their pound of flesh.
tt4912910,"01:15:03,055","01:15:06,955","A man like that, what he's seen. What he knows about British intelligence."
tt4912910,"01:15:06,956","01:15:10,148","They can't have him talking to foreign government, ever."
tt4912910,"01:15:10,149","01:15:12,024",That's not what I'm asking.
tt4912910,"01:15:12,941","01:15:14,982",Why did they sent you?
tt4912910,"01:15:15,226","01:15:17,606",This is how I prove my loyalty.
tt4912910,"01:15:18,615","01:15:21,456",This is how I come home. - But you were out!?
tt4912910,"01:15:21,848","01:15:24,847",You were free? - We're never free.
tt4912910,"01:15:25,823","01:15:30,913",I've spent two years undercover with Lane. To them I'm as much of a threat as he is.
tt4912910,"01:15:32,506","01:15:36,188",I kill him or I never stop running.
tt4912910,"01:15:38,140","01:15:40,829","Now, tell me where he is?"
tt4912910,"01:15:45,496","01:15:50,044",I can't help you. - I'll get to him one way or another.
tt4912910,"01:15:50,960","01:15:53,843","Please, don't make me go trough you."
tt4912910,"01:16:49,832","01:16:50,998",Yes?
tt4912910,"01:16:50,999","01:16:53,395",Are you here in London? <i>- I am.</i>
tt4912910,"01:16:53,966","01:16:56,160",Are you ready to meet the Currier?
tt4912910,"01:16:56,706","01:16:58,806",<i>Yes. Where do I go?</i>
tt4912910,"01:16:59,295","01:17:01,434",Where would you like to meet?
tt4912910,"01:17:03,930","01:17:05,235",<i>LOCATING CALLER</i>
tt4912910,"01:17:39,295","01:17:40,600",Mr. Secretary?
tt4912910,"01:17:41,211","01:17:43,420",I've prayed to God that it wasn't truth.
tt4912910,"01:17:43,421","01:17:46,044","Well, in his defense, sir, if Ethan hadn't intervened"
tt4912910,"01:17:46,045","01:17:48,160",the great many people would've been killed.
tt4912910,"01:17:48,161","01:17:51,035","Yes, Dunn, I'm sure that the good people of Paris and the nation of France"
tt4912910,"01:17:51,036","01:17:54,140",as a whole will take that into account.
tt4912910,"01:17:54,563","01:17:56,382","So, what the hell happened?"
tt4912910,"01:18:15,553","01:18:18,358",At which point we were told to come to London.
tt4912910,"01:18:18,878","01:18:22,128",And await further instructions. - And what happens now?
tt4912910,"01:18:22,546","01:18:23,851",Now?
tt4912910,"01:18:24,842","01:18:26,341",We meet the Widow in 20 minutes.
tt4912910,"01:18:26,342","01:18:28,801",She's gonna take us to Currier who'll hand over our
tt4912910,"01:18:28,802","01:18:31,047",missing plutonium in exchange for Solomon Lane.
tt4912910,"01:18:31,048","01:18:32,878",Or in our scenario...
tt4912910,"01:18:33,888","01:18:35,193",Benji.
tt4912910,"01:18:35,674","01:18:36,979",Jesus!
tt4912910,"01:18:37,062","01:18:38,367","I'm sorry, what?"
tt4912910,"01:18:38,391","01:18:39,811",Luther and I are gonna take you to Currier.
tt4912910,"01:18:39,812","01:18:42,662",Walker stays here and guards the real Lane. - Absolutely not!
tt4912910,"01:18:42,663","01:18:45,413","Wait, wait! Why do I have to be Lane? - Benji."
tt4912910,"01:18:45,422","01:18:50,286","Our mission, my mission is to recover that plutonium and I will do so at any cost!"
tt4912910,"01:18:50,287","01:18:53,510",Even if I have to trade Lane. The real Lane!
tt4912910,"01:18:53,623","01:18:55,534",And I'll never let him go!
tt4912910,"01:18:55,568","01:18:58,626",When the Apostles realize that you're playing games
tt4912910,"01:18:58,627","01:19:01,207",you'll lose the plutonium. Again!
tt4912910,"01:19:01,283","01:19:03,044",You let us worry about the Apostles.
tt4912910,"01:19:03,045","01:19:05,812",As it stands we have a bigger problem.
tt4912910,"01:19:05,856","01:19:07,161",A bigger problem.
tt4912910,"01:19:08,027","01:19:12,405",Ilsa. - Ilsa? Our Ilsa? Ilsa Faust? How's she mixed up in all of this?
tt4912910,"01:19:12,406","01:19:15,015",She's been ordered to kill Lane. Direct from <i>MI6</i>.
tt4912910,"01:19:15,016","01:19:19,051",Look. Wait. So that was her in Paris? On the bike? - Yeah.
tt4912910,"01:19:19,052","01:19:20,893","Ethan, she tried to kill us! - No, not us."
tt4912910,"01:19:20,894","01:19:22,902","Yeah! - Not us, Lane. She tried to kill Lane."
tt4912910,"01:19:22,903","01:19:26,113",She has no choice. - And she'll kill me! - I'm not gonna let that happen!
tt4912910,"01:19:26,114","01:19:29,308","Ethan, how exactly are you not gonna let that happen?"
tt4912910,"01:19:30,496","01:19:32,415","I'm working on it. - Oh, he's working on it."
tt4912910,"01:19:32,416","01:19:33,837",Right now we don't have a lot of time.
tt4912910,"01:19:33,838","01:19:35,366",We have to start getting ready for this meeting.
tt4912910,"01:19:35,367","01:19:37,019",The meeting is a trap.
tt4912910,"01:19:38,277","01:19:42,694",The White Widow is working with the <i>CIA</i>. She has been since the beginning.
tt4912910,"01:19:42,726","01:19:45,530",Bargaining for immunity is her stock and trade.
tt4912910,"01:19:45,531","01:19:47,973",Capturing the plutonium and the Apostles and John Lark
tt4912910,"01:19:47,974","01:19:50,536",buys her a lot of good will with the Americans.
tt4912910,"01:19:50,537","01:19:53,961",But if Sloan knew the meeting was a trap why didn't she just tell us?
tt4912910,"01:19:53,962","01:19:57,990",Because in her mind anybody could be John Lark. Including one of us.
tt4912910,"01:19:59,112","01:20:01,417",And now her suspicions are confirmed.
tt4912910,"01:20:03,610","01:20:06,828",According to that dossier a trail of electronic evidence
tt4912910,"01:20:06,829","01:20:10,103",connects Hunt to the theft of smallpox from the <i>CDC</i>.
tt4912910,"01:20:10,689","01:20:12,962",It also links him to a lengthy correspondence
tt4912910,"01:20:12,963","01:20:15,490",ending with the recruitment of Dr. Debruuk.
tt4912910,"01:20:15,491","01:20:19,352",And of course Hunt handed over the plutonium to Apostles himself.
tt4912910,"01:20:19,710","01:20:24,570","Now, those facts coupled with a a long and incriminating history of rogue behavior"
tt4912910,"01:20:24,755","01:20:28,019",collaborate a <i>CIA</i> narrative
tt4912910,"01:20:28,173","01:20:30,009",that Hunt has snapped.
tt4912910,"01:20:30,664","01:20:35,136",And the search for Lark is nothing but a cover to hide the fact that Lark...
tt4912910,"01:20:35,873","01:20:37,178",... Is me.
tt4912910,"01:20:39,016","01:20:42,039","I gotta hand it to you, Ethan. Normally when people refer to"
tt4912910,"01:20:42,040","01:20:45,456",you as your own worst enemy it's just a figure of speech.
tt4912910,"01:20:49,988","01:20:53,071",I'm afraid Sloan got some questions for her as well.
tt4912910,"01:20:53,309","01:20:56,059",The Widow offered her up at no extra charge.
tt4912910,"01:20:56,708","01:20:59,236",And where did Sloan get this information?
tt4912910,"01:20:59,615","01:21:01,500",She didn't say.
tt4912910,"01:21:01,820","01:21:04,200","She did, however, grant me the opportunity to bring you"
tt4912910,"01:21:04,201","01:21:06,384",in on the condition that I terminate this mission.
tt4912910,"01:21:06,385","01:21:08,782",And hand over Solomon Lane personally.
tt4912910,"01:21:09,497","01:21:13,980","Sir, you can't do that. - Hunt! - No, I know Lane. He has no intention of going back."
tt4912910,"01:21:13,981","01:21:18,743",That's why we're taking him back! - Which means that's exactly what he wont us to do.
tt4912910,"01:21:18,744","01:21:21,104","Ethan. - Sir, what do you think, this is a coincidence?"
tt4912910,"01:21:21,105","01:21:23,438",That Sloan just happened to found this? Lane had it sent to her!
tt4912910,"01:21:23,439","01:21:27,981",He know how she'd react. Just like he knew the Widow would turn us in. Don't you see?
tt4912910,"01:21:27,982","01:21:31,510","This, sir. This is the trap!"
tt4912910,"01:21:31,807","01:21:36,469","We're being directed. - Hunt! - Sir, there are still two plutonium cores in the wind!"
tt4912910,"01:21:36,470","01:21:38,677",And you lost them!
tt4912910,"01:21:40,669","01:21:43,698","In fairness, sir, we all lost them."
tt4912910,"01:21:43,730","01:21:45,748","Respectfully, sir."
tt4912910,"01:21:45,965","01:21:50,270","You weren't there. - So, making excuses for him is your full-time job now?!"
tt4912910,"01:21:50,531","01:21:53,870","Good God, Ethan. Don't make this any harder than it already is."
tt4912910,"01:21:53,871","01:21:56,862",I can no longer protect you! Don't you understand that?
tt4912910,"01:21:56,863","01:21:59,840",This is as close as you're ever gonna get to that plutonium!
tt4912910,"01:21:59,841","01:22:03,165","Sir, you don't actually believe this? - I believe I've been given a choice"
tt4912910,"01:22:03,166","01:22:06,820",to protect you or the <i>IMF</i>. Which is why I'm bringing you in.
tt4912910,"01:22:07,616","01:22:11,257",And if I refuse? - What do you think he's here for?!
tt4912910,"01:22:11,410","01:22:14,271",You think he's some observer? He's an assassin!
tt4912910,"01:22:14,395","01:22:17,002",Erica Sloans number one <i>plumber</i>.
tt4912910,"01:22:17,119","01:22:20,091","You go rogue, he's authorized to hunt you down..."
tt4912910,"01:22:20,203","01:22:21,972",...and kill you.
tt4912910,"01:22:25,196","01:22:26,401",It's the job.
tt4912910,"01:22:26,402","01:22:27,707",No hard feeling.
tt4912910,"01:22:28,154","01:22:31,737","Except it, Ethan. You've lost this one. What's done is done."
tt4912910,"01:22:33,471","01:22:34,776","No, sir."
tt4912910,"01:22:35,107","01:22:36,412",No.
tt4912910,"01:22:36,484","01:22:41,607",I'm not asking you. I'm giving you a direct order. This mission is terminated.
tt4912910,"01:22:42,193","01:22:43,498",Now!
tt4912910,"01:22:46,528","01:22:50,667","Stickell, he's your friend. Would you, please, talk some sense into..."
tt4912910,"01:22:52,322","01:22:54,905","I'm sorry, sir. But you left me no choice."
tt4912910,"01:22:57,265","01:22:59,513",There's 15 minutes before we meet the Widow. You want the plutonium?
tt4912910,"01:22:59,514","01:23:01,586",We're the only ones who can get it for you.
tt4912910,"01:23:01,587","01:23:03,601",You're in or out?!
tt4912910,"01:23:04,474","01:23:05,611",In.
tt4912910,"01:23:05,612","01:23:08,110",What are you doing? - Benji needs to get ready.
tt4912910,"01:23:08,111","01:23:11,805","No! Ethan... - There's no time, Luther. I need you to trust me."
tt4912910,"01:23:28,711","01:23:30,016",You're all right?
tt4912910,"01:23:30,276","01:23:31,581","Yeah, I just..."
tt4912910,"01:23:32,430","01:23:34,791",...gotta a bad feeling about this one.
tt4912910,"01:24:00,398","01:24:02,259",If you don't hear from us...
tt4912910,"01:24:02,372","01:24:03,677",I'll do it my way.
tt4912910,"01:24:07,880","01:24:09,797",Don't take your eyes off him.
tt4912910,"01:24:46,264","01:24:48,285",Enough games. I'll take you out of here.
tt4912910,"01:24:48,286","01:24:49,984",Where's Hunt?
tt4912910,"01:24:50,111","01:24:53,344",He's gone to the meeting. With a copy of you. - Calm down.
tt4912910,"01:24:53,345","01:24:56,862",Call the Apostles. Warn them. - I have no way of contacting them.
tt4912910,"01:24:56,863","01:24:58,769",For their safety and mine.
tt4912910,"01:24:58,841","01:25:01,016",But I do have an extraction team and satellite over-watch
tt4912910,"01:25:01,017","01:25:02,754",at pre-arranged <i>rendezvous</i>.
tt4912910,"01:25:02,755","01:25:05,161",They'll know as soon as we leave the building. - No.
tt4912910,"01:25:05,162","01:25:08,728",I'm staying here. I haven't finished with Hunt yet.
tt4912910,"01:25:12,852","01:25:16,478",Why did you have to make this so fucking complicated?!
tt4912910,"01:25:16,837","01:25:20,129",I don't understand what do you mean? - The deal was simple.
tt4912910,"01:25:20,130","01:25:23,139",I help you frame Hunt. You give me plutonium.
tt4912910,"01:25:23,497","01:25:28,585",You're wasting time! - There can not be peace without first a great suffering.
tt4912910,"01:25:29,013","01:25:31,985","The greater the suffering, the greater the peace."
tt4912910,"01:25:32,043","01:25:36,964",When I wrote those words I wasn't referring to your peace. Or Hunts suffering.
tt4912910,"01:25:37,736","01:25:41,672",The old world order needs dismantling and we have the tools to dismantle it.
tt4912910,"01:25:41,673","01:25:46,014",All you seem to care about is that Hunt lives to take the blame.
tt4912910,"01:25:46,253","01:25:49,310",That's not anarchy. That's revenge.
tt4912910,"01:25:49,602","01:25:51,410","Yes, it is."
tt4912910,"01:25:51,722","01:25:56,236",And when I have what I want the Apostles are getting the plutonium.
tt4912910,"01:26:00,573","01:26:03,026",Hunt's the only friend you've got. You're only alive today
tt4912910,"01:26:03,027","01:26:05,363",because he didn't have the guts to kill you!
tt4912910,"01:26:05,364","01:26:08,108",Sloan is rights. The <i>IMF</i> is Halloween.
tt4912910,"01:26:08,304","01:26:10,679",Nothing but grown men wearing...
tt4912910,"01:26:17,910","01:26:19,215",What?
tt4912910,"01:26:24,774","01:26:27,890",It's just the job. No hard feelings.
tt4912910,"01:26:32,022","01:26:34,217","I've ruined your day, haven't I?"
tt4912910,"01:26:37,568","01:26:40,209",And you were doing so well up until then.
tt4912910,"01:26:40,505","01:26:42,826",And I think this one's loaded.
tt4912910,"01:26:43,059","01:26:45,021",You want to find out?
tt4912910,"01:27:26,959","01:27:29,487","So, how did I do? - I never had any doubt."
tt4912910,"01:27:31,296","01:27:33,973",I'm beginning to see why you guys enjoy this so much.
tt4912910,"01:27:33,974","01:27:37,060","Hands off, Mr. Secretary. - Man's a natural."
tt4912910,"01:27:37,150","01:27:39,067","Welcome to the team, sir."
tt4912910,"01:27:39,365","01:27:41,004",You're making a mistake.
tt4912910,"01:27:41,181","01:27:45,412","No, the mistake was mine when I saved your life over Paris."
tt4912910,"01:27:45,770","01:27:48,171",This proves nothing. I'm playing a role.
tt4912910,"01:27:48,172","01:27:50,690",Just like you're. Trying to recover that plutonium.
tt4912910,"01:27:50,691","01:27:54,412",That doesn't explain why you gave Sloan the dossier and tried to frame Hunt.
tt4912910,"01:27:54,413","01:27:57,360","He makes a good point, Lark."
tt4912910,"01:27:57,829","01:28:02,182",He's paranoid. Delusional. Just like the dossier says.
tt4912910,"01:28:02,183","01:28:05,600",So where did Sloan get the dossier from? - I have no idea.
tt4912910,"01:28:05,867","01:28:07,172",I do.
tt4912910,"01:28:10,099","01:28:13,029","Did you get all that, Erica? <i>- I did.</i>"
tt4912910,"01:28:13,553","01:28:16,313","<i>I don't appreciate being used, Walker.</i>"
tt4912910,"01:28:17,676","01:28:19,803",Bad boy.
tt4912910,"01:28:20,953","01:28:24,203",Where would you like him delivered? - I'll come to you.
tt4912910,"01:28:27,113","01:28:30,679",Nobody move! Put them down! Drop them!
tt4912910,"01:28:31,163","01:28:33,499",Hands in the air! Weapons down!
tt4912910,"01:28:33,725","01:28:35,593",Drop it! Drop it!
tt4912910,"01:28:35,907","01:28:38,231",Weapons down! Rights now! You! - It's OK. - You!
tt4912910,"01:28:38,232","01:28:40,869",It's OK. - I'm talking to you! - It's all right.
tt4912910,"01:28:40,870","01:28:44,822",I though we had a deal? <i>- We did and now we don't.</i>
tt4912910,"01:28:45,342","01:28:48,696",<i>There's too much at stake here for me to take any chances.</i>
tt4912910,"01:28:48,697","01:28:51,839",I'm bringing you all in. Along with Walker.
tt4912910,"01:28:51,921","01:28:53,481",The plutonium is still out there!
tt4912910,"01:28:53,482","01:28:56,054",And I don't trust a living soul in that room to get it.
tt4912910,"01:28:56,055","01:28:59,166",<i>We'll sort out who's who in Washington.</i>
tt4912910,"01:28:59,757","01:29:01,650",Erica! - Sir.
tt4912910,"01:29:01,988","01:29:04,682",It's all right. Let's just do what she says.
tt4912910,"01:29:05,305","01:29:08,666",The only real threats are in this room and we have them.
tt4912910,"01:29:10,969","01:29:12,274",Do you?
tt4912910,"01:29:13,435","01:29:14,740",Go!
tt4912910,"01:29:34,579","01:29:35,884",Where are they?!
tt4912910,"01:30:06,563","01:30:07,868",Ethan!
tt4912910,"01:30:31,866","01:30:33,894",First team is down. Send backup.
tt4912910,"01:30:37,191","01:30:38,496",I can...
tt4912910,"01:30:39,058","01:30:41,194","Oh, no! Man down!"
tt4912910,"01:30:44,049","01:30:45,807","Somebody, help!"
tt4912910,"01:30:54,741","01:30:56,046",Sir?
tt4912910,"01:31:00,462","01:31:04,156","Ethan, I tagged Walker but he's on the run. You gotta get him."
tt4912910,"01:31:09,565","01:31:10,870",Go.
tt4912910,"01:31:11,973","01:31:13,278","I'm sorry, sir."
tt4912910,"01:31:15,384","01:31:16,689",Go.
tt4912910,"01:31:27,343","01:31:28,648",Ethan.
tt4912910,"01:31:32,696","01:31:34,001",Wait!
tt4912910,"01:31:35,307","01:31:36,946",Get that son of a bitch!
tt4912910,"01:32:05,785","01:32:07,497",Come on! Come on!
tt4912910,"01:32:07,664","01:32:09,191","Yes, I got him!"
tt4912910,"01:32:15,647","01:32:16,952",Back!
tt4912910,"01:32:20,659","01:32:21,964",I'm sorry.
tt4912910,"01:32:22,661","01:32:24,827","Talk to me, Benji. Where's Walker?"
tt4912910,"01:32:24,865","01:32:29,170",<i>He's about quarter mile west of you. Turn right.</i> - Which way? To my right?
tt4912910,"01:32:31,604","01:32:32,909",I can't do that.
tt4912910,"01:32:32,979","01:32:34,284",Why not?
tt4912910,"01:32:35,107","01:32:38,412",Because I'm being followed. <i>- What do you mean? By who?!</i>
tt4912910,"01:32:39,036","01:32:42,005","How do I know. <i>CIA</i>, Apostles, what difference does it make?"
tt4912910,"01:32:42,006","01:32:45,230","<i>OK, OK, just get out of there and then go right.</i>"
tt4912910,"01:32:53,121","01:32:54,871",I'm terribly sorry.
tt4912910,"01:32:55,327","01:32:56,632",Excuse me.
tt4912910,"01:33:13,364","01:33:15,225",Why's he running in circles?
tt4912910,"01:33:41,955","01:33:45,816","OK, you need to cross the street on your left as soon as you can."
tt4912910,"01:33:50,955","01:33:54,260","<i>Did you copy?</i> - Yeah! <i>- Go left, now!</i> - I'm working on it!"
tt4912910,"01:34:05,501","01:34:08,640","<i>OK, now go across the street. Right in front of you!</i>"
tt4912910,"01:34:14,994","01:34:18,911","<i>Ethan, he's getting away from you. You're gonna have to go faster!</i>"
tt4912910,"01:34:48,915","01:34:51,109",You're gaining on him! Go straight.
tt4912910,"01:34:53,317","01:34:55,289",Straight! Keep moving straight!
tt4912910,"01:34:55,506","01:34:58,256",<i>Go straight. Go straight. Straight! Straight!</i>
tt4912910,"01:34:58,939","01:35:01,185","<i>OK, now turn right.</i> - Right?"
tt4912910,"01:35:02,272","01:35:05,065","Now?!<i> - Yes, right!</i> - Are you sure?!"
tt4912910,"01:35:05,452","01:35:09,821","Yes, I'm...! No it's left! Turn left! Sorry, I had screen-lock on."
tt4912910,"01:35:14,221","01:35:15,526",Left?
tt4912910,"01:35:19,349","01:35:20,654",Thank you.
tt4912910,"01:35:26,923","01:35:29,965",What are you waiting for?! - I'm jumping out of a window!
tt4912910,"01:35:29,966","01:35:32,660",What do you mean you're jumping out of...?!
tt4912910,"01:35:33,565","01:35:36,564","Oh, sorry I had it in 2D. Good luck!"
tt4912910,"01:36:11,575","01:36:15,047",At the end of the bridge turn left! You've almost got him.
tt4912910,"01:36:17,859","01:36:22,498","Come on, come on, come on! Come on, Ethan! Get him! You're right on top of him!"
tt4912910,"01:36:36,235","01:36:39,596",That's it! He's right in front of you! Get him! Get him!
tt4912910,"01:37:14,466","01:37:16,160","You can't do it, can you?"
tt4912910,"01:37:16,414","01:37:18,593",Not until you get your plutonium.
tt4912910,"01:37:18,923","01:37:21,943","No, he still has plans for you."
tt4912910,"01:37:23,035","01:37:25,910",You're gonna turn yourself in and admit you're John Lark.
tt4912910,"01:37:25,911","01:37:29,495",Then watch the old world implode from your dark little cell.
tt4912910,"01:37:29,554","01:37:31,173",And if I don't?
tt4912910,"01:37:44,267","01:37:46,382","I'm her guardian angel, Hunt."
tt4912910,"01:37:47,415","01:37:50,218","If I see you again, she dies."
tt4912910,"01:37:50,249","01:37:53,100","If you try to warn her, she dies."
tt4912910,"01:37:53,508","01:37:55,256",Know when you're beat.
tt4912910,"01:39:06,349","01:39:10,045",These are the designs we recovered from Dr. Debruuks lab in Berlin.
tt4912910,"01:39:10,046","01:39:12,431",That's a five mega-ton nuclear device.
tt4912910,"01:39:12,518","01:39:15,114",That's greater than all the explosive energy released in <i>WW2</i>.
tt4912910,"01:39:15,115","01:39:18,270",To disarm it normally we'd cut the fuse wire here.
tt4912910,"01:39:18,783","01:39:23,351",What? Normally? - Walker and Lane have two plutonium cores.
tt4912910,"01:39:23,641","01:39:27,189","Meaning two bombs. - Yeah, and they're both linked by microwave fail-safe"
tt4912910,"01:39:27,190","01:39:29,280",which is accurate to within 1/10 of a second.
tt4912910,"01:39:29,281","01:39:33,139",Any attempt to defuse one bomb automatically triggers the other.
tt4912910,"01:39:33,546","01:39:36,764",Meaning once armed the bombs can't be disarmed.
tt4912910,"01:39:36,814","01:39:41,119",The countdown is started by a remote detonator which is also a fail-safe.
tt4912910,"01:39:41,326","01:39:43,663",Meaning once the countdown starts...
tt4912910,"01:39:44,056","01:39:45,881",...it can't be stopped.
tt4912910,"01:39:47,237","01:39:49,511",So solution for this is?
tt4912910,"01:39:51,921","01:39:53,659",We're working on it.
tt4912910,"01:39:55,070","01:39:56,375",So...
tt4912910,"01:39:56,766","01:39:59,361",Technically this is a suicide mission?
tt4912910,"01:40:10,520","01:40:11,716",What is it?
tt4912910,"01:40:11,717","01:40:14,119",Come and see. Please.
tt4912910,"01:40:18,111","01:40:23,210",In all the years that I've known Ethan he's only been serious about two women.
tt4912910,"01:40:24,147","01:40:26,091",One was his wife.
tt4912910,"01:40:26,941","01:40:30,211","He's married? - No, he was."
tt4912910,"01:40:30,646","01:40:32,430",Was? What happened to her?
tt4912910,"01:40:32,946","01:40:36,700","Well, she was taken by some people who wanted to get to Ethan."
tt4912910,"01:40:37,156","01:40:39,853",It's OK. He got her back in one piece.
tt4912910,"01:40:40,521","01:40:42,822",Then he quit the game.
tt4912910,"01:40:43,055","01:40:45,169",They were happy for a while.
tt4912910,"01:40:45,721","01:40:48,437",But every time something bad happened in the world
tt4912910,"01:40:48,438","01:40:51,132",Ethan would think: <i>I should have been there</i>.
tt4912910,"01:40:51,426","01:40:56,235",And she would wonder: <i>Who's watching the world while Ethan is watching me?</i>
tt4912910,"01:40:56,654","01:40:59,663","Deep down they both knew that someday, somehow,"
tt4912910,"01:40:59,664","01:41:02,828",something truly terrible was going to happen.
tt4912910,"01:41:04,341","01:41:06,872",All because they were together.
tt4912910,"01:41:07,680","01:41:08,985",So...
tt4912910,"01:41:11,194","01:41:15,046",Where is she now? - She's a ghost. Good at it too.
tt4912910,"01:41:15,865","01:41:17,689",Taught her myself.
tt4912910,"01:41:18,101","01:41:21,720",Every now and then she sends up a signal to let Ethan know she's safe.
tt4912910,"01:41:21,721","01:41:23,459",And that keeps him going.
tt4912910,"01:41:25,310","01:41:27,171",Why are you telling me this?
tt4912910,"01:41:30,936","01:41:34,130",We're in this mess because Ethan wouldn't let me die.
tt4912910,"01:41:36,537","01:41:38,782",He's a good man.
tt4912910,"01:41:39,018","01:41:42,846",And he cares about you. More than he can admit.
tt4912910,"01:41:43,792","01:41:47,233",That's one more worry than he can handle right now.
tt4912910,"01:41:50,011","01:41:54,328","If you care about him, you should walk away."
tt4912910,"01:41:57,878","01:41:59,183",If only...
tt4912910,"01:41:59,204","01:42:00,509",Serves me right.
tt4912910,"01:42:13,157","01:42:14,629",I'm coming with you.
tt4912910,"01:42:23,597","01:42:24,902",I know.
tt4912910,"01:42:29,011","01:42:30,594","So, how do we find him?"
tt4912910,"01:42:31,843","01:42:36,339",Microwave transponder. Traceable via satellite anywhere in the world.
tt4912910,"01:42:36,661","01:42:39,466",Lane had one of these in the back of his neck.
tt4912910,"01:42:39,534","01:42:40,870",We removed it in Paris.
tt4912910,"01:42:40,871","01:42:43,905","Same time, we put our own transponder in. - Got it!"
tt4912910,"01:42:46,195","01:42:50,955",36 hour delayed activation. In case Lanes Apostles scan him.
tt4912910,"01:42:52,396","01:42:56,473","So you planned on letting him go? - Not this way, but yes."
tt4912910,"01:42:56,954","01:43:00,235",He's gonna lead us to the plutonium. - How can you be sure?
tt4912910,"01:43:00,236","01:43:02,819",His plan to put me in prison went to hell.
tt4912910,"01:43:03,605","01:43:06,133",Now he's gonna want me there for the end.
tt4912910,"01:43:06,488","01:43:09,608",So when does this transponder activate... - I got it! I got it! I got it!
tt4912910,"01:43:09,609","01:43:12,934",He's traveling east over Europe at 500 mph. - He's airborne.
tt4912910,"01:43:12,935","01:43:14,690",Should we inform the <i>CIA</i>?
tt4912910,"01:43:14,925","01:43:18,842",<i>CIA</i> has been infiltrated. I don't trust anybody outside this room.
tt4912910,"01:43:19,191","01:43:21,108",We're gonna have to go alone.
tt4912910,"01:43:23,815","01:43:25,370","So, where do we go?"
tt4912910,"01:43:45,293","01:43:46,876","How're we doing, Benji?"
tt4912910,"01:43:47,057","01:43:49,978",If there's a way to defuse this bombs I can't find it.
tt4912910,"01:43:49,979","01:43:52,340",You'll figure it out. I know you will.
tt4912910,"01:43:53,585","01:43:55,840","Damn! Ethan, we've lost the signal."
tt4912910,"01:43:56,418","01:43:58,549",Lane must have found our transmitter.
tt4912910,"01:43:58,550","01:44:01,744",What's his last position? - About 30 miles north-east.
tt4912910,"01:44:01,889","01:44:04,139",Than that's where he wants us to go.
tt4912910,"01:44:04,355","01:44:07,795",What's there? - The Nubra river valley. There's only a medical camp there.
tt4912910,"01:44:07,796","01:44:09,948",<i>Humanitarian Aid Overseas</i>.
tt4912910,"01:44:10,568","01:44:13,191",Why would Lane target a medical camp?
tt4912910,"01:44:14,130","01:44:15,435",Smallpox.
tt4912910,"01:44:16,625","01:44:20,508",What? - Smallpox. The Apostles triggered smallpox outbreak in Kashmir.
tt4912910,"01:44:20,509","01:44:23,481",Lane must've wanted that camp there for a reason.
tt4912910,"01:44:23,495","01:44:27,087",But what? - Oh my God! - What is it?
tt4912910,"01:44:28,039","01:44:31,400","Well, the Nubra river is at the base of Siachen glacier."
tt4912910,"01:44:31,556","01:44:33,683",So nuclear blast there would irradiate the
tt4912910,"01:44:33,684","01:44:36,545",largest natural irrigation system in the world.
tt4912910,"01:44:36,856","01:44:40,946",Fresh water from the border of China to India and Pakistan.
tt4912910,"01:44:42,091","01:44:44,297",They're gonna starve one third of the worlds population!
tt4912910,"01:44:44,298","01:44:46,333",The greater the suffering...
tt4912910,"01:44:46,334","01:44:48,486",... The greater the peace.
tt4912910,"01:44:49,014","01:44:51,813",I still don't understand why Lane wants a medical camp there.
tt4912910,"01:44:51,814","01:44:56,030",It doesn't matter. All that matters now is that we find a way to defuse those bombs.
tt4912910,"01:44:56,031","01:44:57,959",I think I've found it.
tt4912910,"01:44:58,215","01:45:02,193",Maybe. But there appears to a flaw in bombs operating system.
tt4912910,"01:45:02,213","01:45:05,687",The remote detonator requires that firing key. If you remove that key
tt4912910,"01:45:05,688","01:45:09,535",then it should short-out the fail-safe and allow us to cut both fuses.
tt4912910,"01:45:09,536","01:45:12,529",So one of us needs to get the detonator and remove that key.
tt4912910,"01:45:12,530","01:45:15,884","Yeah, while... - While the rest of us cut the fuses on both bombs."
tt4912910,"01:45:15,885","01:45:18,347","Simple. - Yeah, but..."
tt4912910,"01:45:18,736","01:45:19,970",But what?
tt4912910,"01:45:19,971","01:45:23,427",Well in order to make this work we can't remove the key
tt4912910,"01:45:23,428","01:45:26,858",or cut the fuses until after the countdown starts.
tt4912910,"01:45:28,087","01:45:31,228","Wait, wait! Just so I got this clear. Our only chance to safely defuse"
tt4912910,"01:45:31,229","01:45:34,596",both bombs is to let the countdown start?
tt4912910,"01:45:35,225","01:45:37,840",And then remove that key.
tt4912910,"01:45:46,407","01:45:47,712",OK.
tt4912910,"01:46:05,432","01:46:08,450",Both devices are now connected to the detonator.
tt4912910,"01:46:09,839","01:46:13,978",15 minutes should give you enough time to reach minimum safe distance.
tt4912910,"01:46:16,281","01:46:18,442",My running days are over.
tt4912910,"01:46:19,452","01:46:21,471",This is where it ends for me.
tt4912910,"01:46:50,601","01:46:52,665",I'm getting signals all over the place.
tt4912910,"01:46:52,666","01:46:54,824","That's why the medical camp. X-ray machines,"
tt4912910,"01:46:54,825","01:46:57,883","CAT-scanners, radiological signatures everywhere."
tt4912910,"01:46:57,884","01:47:00,214",Looks like a needle in a haystack. - Process of elimination.
tt4912910,"01:47:00,215","01:47:03,413",One at a time. Let's split up. Stay on comms.
tt4912910,"01:47:13,463","01:47:14,768",Ethan?
tt4912910,"01:47:20,421","01:47:21,726",Julia?
tt4912910,"01:47:26,430","01:47:27,735",Is that?
tt4912910,"01:47:31,777","01:47:33,082",Julia!
tt4912910,"01:47:35,334","01:47:36,639",Does he know?
tt4912910,"01:47:38,243","01:47:41,276","Hey. - This is my husband, Eric."
tt4912910,"01:47:41,822","01:47:44,889","This is... - Rob, Rob Thorn. Dr. Rob Thorn."
tt4912910,"01:47:45,315","01:47:49,048","I worked with Julia at... - Mass General, before New York."
tt4912910,"01:47:49,225","01:47:53,776","Oh, you're kidding? What a coincidence? - I know. I... - What brings you all this way?"
tt4912910,"01:47:53,777","01:47:56,360","I was in Turtuk, not far from here."
tt4912910,"01:47:56,675","01:47:59,252",And heard help is needed.
tt4912910,"01:47:59,526","01:48:02,342","Oh, well... Actually we're just about finished here."
tt4912910,"01:48:02,343","01:48:05,321",The whole village is inoculated but...
tt4912910,"01:48:05,813","01:48:07,785",What were you doing at Turtuk?
tt4912910,"01:48:08,130","01:48:09,869",Rob's on vacation.
tt4912910,"01:48:10,046","01:48:12,731","No... No, I'm working."
tt4912910,"01:48:14,942","01:48:16,803",You're a long way from home.
tt4912910,"01:48:17,015","01:48:19,712","Yeah, yeah. Thanks to our guardian angel."
tt4912910,"01:48:19,881","01:48:20,946",Guardian?
tt4912910,"01:48:20,947","01:48:23,557","Well, yeah. We were running a field hospital outside of Darfur"
tt4912910,"01:48:23,558","01:48:25,123",when outbreak happened here.
tt4912910,"01:48:25,124","01:48:28,401",Here comes this phone call from an anonymous donor. Out of the blue.
tt4912910,"01:48:28,402","01:48:32,819",And he says he's ready to underwrite the entire operation. One condition...
tt4912910,"01:48:33,212","01:48:35,393",We run the whole thing.
tt4912910,"01:48:35,607","01:48:37,079",Can you believe that?
tt4912910,"01:48:37,798","01:48:39,501",I certainly can.
tt4912910,"01:48:40,513","01:48:43,121",Out of the blue. - Out of the blue.
tt4912910,"01:48:45,351","01:48:49,582","It's quite a full life. - Yeah, you know before Julia I never traveled."
tt4912910,"01:48:49,664","01:48:51,041",<i>I never even left New York.</i>
tt4912910,"01:48:51,042","01:48:55,043","<i>Never left the hospital. 7 days a week, overtime, no vacations.</i>"
tt4912910,"01:48:55,225","01:48:57,124","Ethan, I think I found something."
tt4912910,"01:48:57,125","01:49:00,606",<i>I was just patient checking. You keep the circuit at 50. Heart attack at 55.</i>
tt4912910,"01:49:00,607","01:49:03,425",And she convinced me to let it all go.
tt4912910,"01:49:03,997","01:49:07,802",Help where it's needed most. So we've been on the go ever since.
tt4912910,"01:49:08,085","01:49:10,113",I've never been more fulfilled.
tt4912910,"01:49:11,337","01:49:13,001",I'm happy for you.
tt4912910,"01:49:14,053","01:49:15,358",<i>Right there.</i>
tt4912910,"01:49:17,099","01:49:20,571","Well, we should get going. We have a lot of packing to do."
tt4912910,"01:49:20,673","01:49:22,576","Oh, no. I'll handle that. You two should catch up."
tt4912910,"01:49:22,577","01:49:24,294","Oh no, I should get out of your hair."
tt4912910,"01:49:24,295","01:49:26,569",Are you kidding? You should stick around.
tt4912910,"01:49:26,570","01:49:29,542",I'm just sorry you came all this way for nothing.
tt4912910,"01:49:30,796","01:49:35,426",I'll tell you what. We'll pack and why don't we give you a ride back to Turtuk.
tt4912910,"01:49:35,427","01:49:37,382",You two can catch up in the car.
tt4912910,"01:49:37,383","01:49:38,645",Yeah?
tt4912910,"01:49:38,646","01:49:39,951",You're very kind.
tt4912910,"01:49:40,902","01:49:42,207",Settled.
tt4912910,"01:49:42,267","01:49:43,572",See you soon.
tt4912910,"01:49:45,187","01:49:46,770",It was good to see you.
tt4912910,"01:49:47,704","01:49:50,742","I'm so sorry, Julia. I'm so sorry."
tt4912910,"01:50:12,148","01:50:13,908",Take those helicopters.
tt4912910,"01:50:14,903","01:50:16,951",No one else leaves.
tt4912910,"01:50:25,021","01:50:26,917","Careful, careful, careful."
tt4912910,"01:50:31,269","01:50:33,712",It's armed but the countdown hasn't started yet.
tt4912910,"01:50:33,713","01:50:36,261",The network signal's strong which means the other device is close by.
tt4912910,"01:50:36,262","01:50:39,892",And the detonator. By half km in that direction.
tt4912910,"01:50:40,990","01:50:42,726",They're still here.
tt4912910,"01:50:43,649","01:50:46,899","Luther, you keep working on it. You two, come with me!"
tt4912910,"01:50:47,756","01:50:49,854","Oh, sure. I've got this."
tt4912910,"01:50:50,486","01:50:52,403",Don't worry about old Luther.

tt4912910,"01:52:06,373","01:52:07,734",I'll figure it out!
tt4912910,"01:52:08,355","01:52:10,716",You find Lane and find the other bomb!
tt4912910,"01:52:11,645","01:52:15,062",What to hell is he doing?! - I find it's best not to look.
tt4912910,"01:52:49,664","01:52:52,781","How're we doing, Luther? - Tripwires everywhere. I don't have enough hands."
tt4912910,"01:52:52,782","01:52:56,414",<i>Just make it out!</i> - Where's Ethan? - He's gone after the detonator.

tt4912910,"01:57:43,837","01:57:45,142",Shit!
tt4912910,"01:57:49,217","01:57:50,522",Dammit!
tt4912910,"01:57:51,353","01:57:52,658",Get up there!
tt4912910,"01:58:01,240","01:58:02,545",That's right.
tt4912910,"01:58:03,054","01:58:04,359",Prick!
tt4912910,"01:58:13,733","01:58:15,038",Shit!
tt4912910,"01:58:20,878","01:58:22,183",Son of a bitch!
tt4912910,"01:58:25,162","01:58:26,467",Got it!
tt4912910,"01:58:34,966","01:58:36,694",Do it! Do it!
tt4912910,"01:58:37,466","01:58:38,466",Shit!
tt4912910,"01:58:38,467","01:58:41,523",<i>Pull up! Pull up!</i>
tt4912910,"01:58:41,860","01:58:45,925",<i>Delaying! Delaying! Pull up! Pull up!</i>
tt4912910,"01:58:47,480","01:58:51,324","I'm trying, I'm trying! <i>Delaying! Delaying!</i>"
tt4912910,"01:59:08,443","01:59:11,770",I can not find anything. I think we're looking in the wrong place.
tt4912910,"01:59:11,771","01:59:14,555",Signature's everywhere. This is the perfect place to hide it.
tt4912910,"01:59:14,556","01:59:15,940",That's the point. I know Lane.
tt4912910,"01:59:15,941","01:59:17,580",If we're looking here...
tt4912910,"01:59:18,317","01:59:20,348",It's because he wants us to.
tt4912910,"01:59:23,159","01:59:26,298",I'm heading to village. - Just wait for me. Alright?
tt4912910,"01:59:29,715","01:59:31,991","Ilsa, I think I found something."
tt4912910,"01:59:35,613","01:59:38,122","Cut this wire, right here."
tt4912910,"01:59:38,964","01:59:43,315",Turn that screw counterclockwise very slowly.
tt4912910,"01:59:46,119","01:59:47,424",So...
tt4912910,"01:59:49,260","01:59:50,355",How's he?
tt4912910,"01:59:50,356","01:59:53,419","Well, you know. Same old Ethan."
tt4912910,"02:00:02,971","02:00:04,276",Jesus!
tt4912910,"02:00:07,766","02:00:08,993",Shit!
tt4912910,"02:00:08,994","02:00:10,907","No, no, no!"
tt4912910,"02:00:19,172","02:00:20,413","Benji, I see Lane now."
tt4912910,"02:00:20,414","02:00:23,334",What?! Where? - He's in a house at the enter to the village.
tt4912910,"02:00:23,335","02:00:25,363",Alright. Just wait for me. OK?
tt4912910,"02:00:25,638","02:00:27,014","<i>Ilsa, wait for me!</i>"
tt4912910,"02:00:37,171","02:00:38,476",No!
tt4912910,"02:00:43,715","02:00:45,020",Nuclear bomb.
tt4912910,"02:00:56,025","02:00:57,330",Dammit!
tt4912910,"02:01:40,257","02:01:42,229","Benji, I found the other bomb."
tt4912910,"02:01:42,567","02:01:45,039","Ilsa, where are you?! - I'm in a house..."
tt4912910,"02:02:08,019","02:02:10,158",Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
tt4912910,"02:02:10,189","02:02:13,550",You're out of your mind! I don't know what's down there!
tt4912910,"02:02:17,695","02:02:19,140",Pull up! Pull up!
tt4912910,"02:02:29,040","02:02:32,269",This crazy son of a bitch is trying to ram us! Go!
tt4912910,"02:02:50,047","02:02:51,352",Yes!
tt4912910,"02:02:51,664","02:02:56,303","Benji, come in. We're almost at the fuse. We need to find that other bomb, now!"
tt4912910,"02:02:57,414","02:03:00,562","Did you say other bomb? <i>- Benji, do you read me?</i>"
tt4912910,"02:03:00,670","02:03:02,145",I'm working on it!
tt4912910,"02:03:02,474","02:03:04,260","Ilsa, where are you?!"
tt4912910,"02:03:22,243","02:03:27,458",He can't stop it. Understand? There's nothing he can do.
tt4912910,"02:03:27,566","02:03:31,094",When the clock runs out Ethan Hunt will loose everything...
tt4912910,"02:03:31,957","02:03:33,663",And everyone...
tt4912910,"02:03:34,656","02:03:36,742",...he ever cared about.
tt4912910,"02:03:38,094","02:03:40,201","<i>Ilsa, Ilsa!</i> - Benji!"
tt4912910,"02:03:40,675","02:03:43,045","Benji!<i> - Ilsa, where are you?!</i>"
tt4912910,"02:03:44,537","02:03:46,467",You don't want to see this.
tt4912910,"02:03:48,156","02:03:49,461",Benji!
tt4912910,"02:03:49,769","02:03:51,074",<i>Ilsa?</i> - Benji!
tt4912910,"02:03:51,343","02:03:53,123","Benji, release me!"
tt4912910,"02:03:53,478","02:03:54,923","No, no!"
tt4912910,"02:04:22,847","02:04:24,152",Benji!
tt4912910,"02:04:48,749","02:04:51,551","No, no, no!"
tt4912910,"02:05:30,759","02:05:32,509",Stay with me! Stay with me!
tt4912910,"02:05:35,448","02:05:39,642",No! Not when I'm this close. Not when I'm this close! Come on! Come on!
tt4912910,"02:05:40,427","02:05:41,732",Yes!
tt4912910,"02:07:25,207","02:07:26,154",Thank you.
tt4912910,"02:07:26,155","02:07:27,460",Tie him up.
tt4912910,"02:08:31,178","02:08:33,821",Why won't you just die?
tt4912910,"02:08:55,683","02:08:57,766",There's nothing else you can do.
tt4912910,"02:08:59,074","02:09:00,836",Go be with your husband.
tt4912910,"02:09:02,228","02:09:03,533",Luther...
tt4912910,"02:09:04,088","02:09:05,393",Go.
tt4912910,"02:09:18,808","02:09:20,163","Benji, where are you?"
tt4912910,"02:09:20,164","02:09:21,787","OK, Luther, we're inside. Tell us what to do."
tt4912910,"02:09:21,788","02:09:24,456",<i>You should keep the red wire attached to the motherboard.</i> - Yeah.
tt4912910,"02:09:24,457","02:09:28,374",You need to cut that and the green wire next to it simultaneously.
tt4912910,"02:09:29,424","02:09:31,950",OK. Ready? Set? Cut.
tt4912910,"02:09:34,079","02:09:38,281",I told you it can't be stopped. There's nothing you can do.
tt4912910,"02:12:56,509","02:13:00,287","<i>Benji, listen.</i> Turn the screw counterclockwise. - Yup."
tt4912910,"02:13:01,776","02:13:06,375",<i>Remove that panel and you'll see the power and ground wires for the fuse.</i> - Got it.
tt4912910,"02:13:06,376","02:13:11,520","When the time comes cut the green wire. <i>Do not cut it yet!</i> - OK, we copy."
tt4912910,"02:13:16,859","02:13:20,144","Ethan, if you can hear me, we're ready to make the cut."
tt4912910,"02:13:20,145","02:13:21,450","Ethan, come in!"
tt4912910,"02:13:21,709","02:13:24,649","Benji, how do we know if he's got the key?"
tt4912910,"02:13:24,964","02:13:28,852","<i>He'll get it.</i> - Yeah, but how do we know? - He'll get it done!"
tt4912910,"02:13:35,076","02:13:36,845",We're out of time! We just have to hope he has it!
tt4912910,"02:13:36,846","02:13:39,002",OK. We're ready. <i>- Two seconds we cut!</i>
tt4912910,"02:13:39,003","02:13:41,828","Wait, wait! Why two? Why not one? - You want to cut it that close?"
tt4912910,"02:13:41,829","02:13:43,416","Well, it's the second we'll never get back!"
tt4912910,"02:13:43,417","02:13:46,073",Wait! Can we make a decision on this?! - Alright! We'll do it on one!
tt4912910,"02:13:46,074","02:13:48,824","Cutting on one? - Yes, one! Alright, stand by."
tt4912910,"02:13:51,153","02:13:55,059","3, 2, 1, now!"
tt4912910,"02:14:33,668","02:14:34,973",OK.
tt4912910,"02:14:46,157","02:14:47,462",My man.
tt4912910,"02:15:40,861","02:15:42,166",Ethan?
tt4912910,"02:15:45,815","02:15:47,120",Can you hear me?
tt4912910,"02:15:50,900","02:15:52,672","No, don't, don't."
tt4912910,"02:15:53,345","02:15:54,650",Don't try to move.
tt4912910,"02:15:55,077","02:15:56,138",Don't move.
tt4912910,"02:15:56,139","02:15:57,778",You're pretty banged up.
tt4912910,"02:16:00,787","02:16:02,069",You're a lucky man.
tt4912910,"02:16:02,070","02:16:05,034",It's a miracle that crash didn't kill you Dr. Thorn.
tt4912910,"02:16:05,035","02:16:08,234",If your friend didn't find you an hour later you would've died from exposure.
tt4912910,"02:16:08,235","02:16:10,251",My friend? - Yeah.
tt4912910,"02:16:12,725","02:16:15,030",She got here not long after you left.
tt4912910,"02:16:15,369","02:16:17,786",Right in front of half the Indian army.
tt4912910,"02:16:18,419","02:16:21,058","Can you give us just a few minutes, please?"
tt4912910,"02:16:22,775","02:16:24,946","See you later, doc."
tt4912910,"02:16:31,369","02:16:32,674","Julia,"
tt4912910,"02:16:34,031","02:16:35,336",I'm sorry.
tt4912910,"02:16:36,008","02:16:38,603",There's no reason to be sorry. - No.
tt4912910,"02:16:38,900","02:16:40,205",I'm sorry...
tt4912910,"02:16:41,672","02:16:43,200",...for everything. I...
tt4912910,"02:16:45,344","02:16:46,649",Look at me.
tt4912910,"02:16:47,655","02:16:48,960",Look at me.
tt4912910,"02:16:49,307","02:16:51,421",Look at my life.
tt4912910,"02:16:52,520","02:16:58,023",I love what I do and I never would've found this if I hadn't met you.
tt4912910,"02:16:58,984","02:17:01,476",Everything that happened...
tt4912910,"02:17:01,926","02:17:07,936",...though me a way and showed me what I'm capable of and I...
tt4912910,"02:17:08,464","02:17:10,782",I'm a survivor.
tt4912910,"02:17:11,271","02:17:13,647",But what happened here...
tt4912910,"02:17:14,002","02:17:17,754",It was my... - Nothing happened. Because you were here.
tt4912910,"02:17:20,145","02:17:24,618",And I sleep soundly at night knowing you always will be.
tt4912910,"02:17:32,921","02:17:34,226",You're happy?
tt4912910,"02:17:34,360","02:17:35,665",Very.
tt4912910,"02:17:39,012","02:17:41,506",I'm exactly where I should be.
tt4912910,"02:17:43,528","02:17:46,190",And so are you.
tt4912910,"02:18:24,673","02:18:26,302",Per your request.
tt4912910,"02:18:27,440","02:18:30,844",I'm handing Solomon Lane back to <i>MI6</i>.
tt4912910,"02:18:35,519","02:18:37,911","Trough a broker, of course."
tt4912910,"02:18:39,843","02:18:42,649",Part of our ongoing arrangement.
tt4912910,"02:18:47,865","02:18:49,802",After what happened in Paris
tt4912910,"02:18:50,438","02:18:53,292",we prefer to keep a low profile.
tt4912910,"02:18:55,390","02:19:00,474",And that closes your friends account with British intelligence.
tt4912910,"02:19:01,675","02:19:04,349",The ribs. Watch the ribs.
tt4912910,"02:19:04,612","02:19:07,867",I understand now why Hunley believed in you.
tt4912910,"02:19:08,377","02:19:11,157",The world needs the <i>IMF</i>.
tt4912910,"02:19:11,521","02:19:13,803",We need people like you.
tt4912910,"02:19:13,804","02:19:16,143",Who care about the one life
tt4912910,"02:19:16,674","02:19:20,021",as much as they care about the millions.
tt4912910,"02:19:21,367","02:19:24,727",That way I never have to.
tt4912910,"02:19:25,576","02:19:26,881",You're OK?
tt4912910,"02:19:27,919","02:19:30,063",You've never looked better. - Don’t!
tt4912910,"02:19:32,713","02:19:34,712",How close were we?
tt4912910,"02:19:37,146","02:19:38,451",The usual.
tt4912910,"02:19:42,730","02:19:44,035",Usual?
tt4912910,"02:19:45,773","02:19:47,909","Please, don't make me lough."
