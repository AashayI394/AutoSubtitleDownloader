2
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:23,945
Hey, how did you manage to leave the cell?

3
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,409
How did you come out of cell? Open door 2.

4
00:03:29,202 --> 00:03:31,454
How did you come out?

5
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:34,594
Return back to the cell!

6
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,501
I told you to go back to the cell!

7
00:03:37,536 --> 00:03:40,647
Let's give you a few friends to play with.

8
00:03:53,536 --> 00:03:55,422
Sorry.

9
00:04:01,612 --> 00:04:03,875
- Send the guards there!
- Yes, sir!

10
00:04:10,178 --> 00:04:12,512
Okay, I'm set. How is things going down below?

11
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:14,282
How do you think? I am in a sewer.

12
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:16,917
Doors do not open. We're stuck here.

13
00:04:16,952 --> 00:04:20,274
Alarm goes off.

14
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:30,080
- We are in danger! We ask for reinforcements!
- Captain!

15
00:04:32,345 --> 00:04:34,397
Damn!

16
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:39,924
- We need reinforcements.
- We have a problem in sector 2E.

17
00:04:45,282 --> 00:04:47,532
I'm in position.

18
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:50,092
Move to phase two.

19
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,570
Wha,what are you doing? What are you doing?

20
00:05:44,605 --> 00:05:46,515
What's wrong? What's happening, Benji?

21
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,176
O God! He is not gonna be in the extraction point.

22
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:51,476
Stay focus. He knows where he's going.

23
00:05:57,853 --> 00:06:01,560
No,  no, I'm not. No, I wouldn't, I would not open that door, please.

24
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:03,578
Go to the  extraction point, Ethan.

25
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:07,656
I know, I know what this means, but I, I can't. I'm not authorized...

26
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:11,962
Go to the extraction point, Ethan. Go to the extraction point!

27
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:16,194
O, we gonna, each we gonna wait, we gonna wait ,we gonna wait. Right, I can wait.

28
00:06:26,425 --> 00:06:28,761
Okay fine! fine! fine!

29
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,254
There! You just, just screw the whole thing up, on purposed. 

30
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:38,607
What do you mean nobody works?

31
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:41,870
ah..Jane, we gonna have a slight delay.

32
00:06:59,723 --> 00:07:02,278
Why do you wanna go in there?

33
00:07:08,653 --> 00:07:10,661
Bogdan.

34
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:13,148
Bogdan.

35
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,520
- Sergei?
- Come on.

36
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:20,097
- You mean now?
- Yes, now.

37
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:25,406
I don't know what he's doing, and for some reasons I'm helping him

38
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:28,338
As long as he's in his ways should be in the sunk end

39
00:07:32,476 --> 00:07:34,720
ah, we have a passenger.

40
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:02,754
Sergei!

41
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,666
Open all!

42
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:29,933
Come on!

43
00:08:34,772 --> 00:08:37,155
God! This is a dead end!

44
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,538
Sergei, do not tell me that this is the end of our escape route.

45
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:20,988
Go ahead.

46
00:09:21,023 --> 00:09:23,911
- Agent Hunt?
- And you're?

47
00:09:23,985 --> 00:09:26,050
Agent Carter.

48
00:09:26,085 --> 00:09:27,949
Okay.

49
00:09:28,576 --> 00:09:31,095
- Who's your pal?
- I tell you on the way.

50
00:09:35,197 --> 00:09:37,361
Light the fuse!

51
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,785

53
00:11:35,918 --> 00:11:39,160
- Sergei, what happens here?
- Everything is fine, Bogdan.

54
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:42,402
I don't mean to bring up elephant in the room, but what's the big hairy Russian?

55
00:11:42,437 --> 00:11:43,415
Who, Bogdan?

56
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,874
He said me intel. If I left him there, they would kill him.

57
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:48,583
So we're gonna give him his freedom. Did you call these sweepers?

58
00:11:48,618 --> 00:11:50,985
- Yeah, they're on their way
- Good, good.

59
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:55,615
Benji, how is it you're here?

60
00:11:56,053 --> 00:11:59,470
Oh, I passed a few exam. Crazy, right?

61
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:01,928
Yeah, it's crazy.

62
00:12:01,963 --> 00:12:03,418
- DNA test.
- It's me.

63
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:05,226
It's procedure. I'm just confirming it's you.

64
00:12:05,227 --> 00:12:07,081
You're very thorough.

65
00:12:07,116 --> 00:12:08,901
Sergei, are you not Russian?

66
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:12,480
- Yes perhaps.
- Sweeps are approaching, brooms are edged.

67
00:12:12,484 --> 00:12:13,664
- Roger that.

68
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:19,231
Sergei, are you not Sergei?

69
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:25,602
You'll be fine. Bogdan ...

70
00:12:25,637 --> 00:12:28,808
- I always take care of my friends.
- My friend ...

71
00:12:35,352 --> 00:12:38,448
- Messy bringing him along?
- I thought it went rather well.

72
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:40,675
You want telling me what are you doing in Russian prison?

73
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,161
Wanna tell me why you brought me up?

74
00:12:44,226 --> 00:12:45,920
This wasn't a rescue mission?

75
00:12:45,955 --> 00:12:47,779
Let me put it this way...

76
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:50,628
If The Secretary wanted me out of there,

77
00:12:51,406 --> 00:12:54,078
must be pretty bad out here.

78
00:12:56,733 --> 00:13:00,126
We were after a file. We lost it.

79
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,915
We? Who lost it, you?

80
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:11,340
- Agent Hanaway.
- Where is Hanaway?

81
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:23,332
It was a little drop

82
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:25,597
... classified file.

83
00:13:25,902 --> 00:13:28,325
It should've been a simple intercept.

84
00:13:36,418 --> 00:13:38,404
They knew, which train the courier was on.

85
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:40,281
ETA 2 minutes on the courier.

86
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:43,267
- But there is one thing we didn't know.
- Wild Cat.

87
00:13:43,268 --> 00:13:44,268
your train six minutes at.

88
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:46,534
Who the courier was.

89
00:13:59,346 --> 00:14:01,139
Now or never, Bob Cap.

90
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:04,233
Hurry! Who's delivering the file, what's his name?  

91
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:08,261
- Go ahead, shoot.
- We're out of time.

92
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:18,063
I need a name, folks. You can't track all these people at once.

93
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:22,424
Aargh, Marek..Stefanski. For the love of God..

94
00:14:22,771 --> 00:14:25,457
- You got it?
- Marek Stefanski.

95
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:30,594
Searching...

96
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:44,763
I'll take it from here.

97
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:55,945
Are you allright, buddy?

98
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,136
Hanaway dropped Marek, and grab his bag.

99
00:14:58,137 --> 00:15:01,884
Sit down. Get your breath.

100
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:06,008
He had the file in his in hands. Easy in easy out.

101
00:15:06,043 --> 00:15:08,446
file's secured.

102
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:11,544
But we weren't the only ones after it.

103
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:14,647
Bob Cap, someone else is scratched this party.

104
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,923
I'm not alone.

105
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,701
- Local police?
- No. Armed hostils.

106
00:15:29,418 --> 00:15:32,765
Maintain, I'm coming. I will get him backing up.

107
00:15:32,957 --> 00:15:36,423
Negative, Operator. Broad the route southwest corner, 60 seconds.

108
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,431
Hanaway's lens came to a facial matched...
and triggered a warning. 

109
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,431
...

110
00:15:45,096 --> 00:15:47,537
But it was too late.

111
00:15:53,447 --> 00:15:55,201
No!

112
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,794
You're gonna be okay.

113
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:07,425
You're so beautiful.

114
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:11,830
I should've told you..

115
00:16:15,987 --> 00:16:18,224
It was my op.

116
00:16:19,156 --> 00:16:21,647
I put him in the field.

117
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,754
And she left him just alive enough for me to see him die.

118
00:16:42,563 --> 00:16:45,096
I'm sorry.

119
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:51,205
- You know her?
- Sabine Moreau. Contract killer.

120
00:16:52,164 --> 00:16:54,536
Works for diamonds.

121
00:16:55,196 --> 00:16:57,286
Who is in the file?

122
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,842
Russian nuclear launch codes.

123
00:17:14,489 --> 00:17:18,263
IMF's been looking for emerging extremist, codenamed Cobalt .

124
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:21,496
He's determined to detonate a nuclear weapon however he can.

125
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:23,666
We know Moreau works for him before.

126
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:26,700
What else did IMF know about him?

127
00:17:27,115 --> 00:17:28,709
As much as you do now.

128
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,587
But if Moreau has nuclear launch codes,

129
00:17:30,588 --> 00:17:35,661
you can bet Cobalt's confirmed person of interest to enemy number one .

130
00:17:35,697 --> 00:17:38,116
We're here.

131
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:04,013
- Agent confirmed.
- Why was he in prison?

132
00:18:04,942 --> 00:18:08,776
He disobeyed. After he and his wife ... you know.

133
00:18:09,683 --> 00:18:13,062
I thought he just been transferred. Or on leave.

134
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,064
There were rumours then...

135
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:17,841
to work on the unsanctioned hit.

136
00:18:17,876 --> 00:18:19,549
Welcome back, Mr. Hunt.

137
00:18:19,584 --> 00:18:22,847
In your absence, IMF has learnt that Cobalt is, or was,

138
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:26,111
a level one nuclear strategist for Russian Intelligent.

139
00:18:26,112 --> 00:18:29,170
Therefore, the only way to uncover his actual identity

140
00:18:29,205 --> 00:18:32,031
is to infiltrate the Kremlin itself.

141
00:18:32,176 --> 00:18:33,616
In order to get passed their checkpoints,

142
00:18:33,651 --> 00:18:36,681
you'll be impersonating General Anatoly Fedorov.

143
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:40,560
We believe Cobalt will do everything he can to destroy any record of his identity.

144
00:18:40,845 --> 00:18:43,172
Your mission, should you choose to accept it,

145
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:46,355
is to penetrate the highly secured archive inside the Kremlin. 

146
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,927
And retrieve Cobalt's file, before he can destroy it.

147
00:18:49,272 --> 00:18:52,105
New intel suggests Cobalt is already in route,

148
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,437
leaving you... 4 hours 52 minutes 

149
00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:56,971
to infiltrate.

150
00:18:57,006 --> 00:18:59,696
To save time, we've chosen your team for you.

151
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:02,729
Agent Carter and Dunn.

152
00:19:03,993 --> 00:19:08,663
As always, should you or any member of your team, be caught or killed.

153
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:11,448
The Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions.

154
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:15,452
This message will self-destruct in 5 seconds.
Good luck, Ethan.

155
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:40,864
What do you got?

156
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:47,799
We're going into the Kremlin.

157
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:52,326
I thought you said "the Kremlin".

158
00:19:52,902 --> 00:19:56,029
I thought you said "the Kremlin".

159
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,711
Okay.

160
00:20:36,011 --> 00:20:38,183
This is very exciting.

161
00:20:39,581 --> 00:20:42,789
Being on the field ... with you, you know.

162
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:46,027
It's a bit of a dream ... for me.

163
00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:50,696
I love your disguise by the way. You look just like him.

164
00:20:52,014 --> 00:20:55,792
It's a shame would wear a masks. You know like a full masks.

165
00:20:56,637 --> 00:20:59,323
Everybody get to wear a mask, but Benji.

166
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:03,269
Sorry. I'm dead. I babbled when I am nervous.

167
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,822
When doing it again, shut up it.

168
00:21:19,254 --> 00:21:22,005
Okay, settle secure to go, that's x-ray machines, cameras...

169
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,756
metal detectors. Just what we expected.

170
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,532
We can do this.

171
00:21:30,468 --> 00:21:34,185
Releasing in three, two, one.

172
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,310
Going fast, going fast, Kremlin going fast.

173
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,947
Mr. General.

174
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:53,742
I am Major Yegorov. Show me the documents, please.

175
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,194
Don't you think I am?

176
00:22:28,068 --> 00:22:31,480
It's not found.

177
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:41,035
Try it again, Major ... ... Yegorov.

178
00:22:49,657 --> 00:22:53,330
Excuse me, General. I did not recognize.

179
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:55,963
You should be kicked out, Major Yegorov.

180
00:23:05,356 --> 00:23:06,955
I think might not going well.

181
00:23:07,402 --> 00:23:10,094
- Relax.
- Sorry.

182
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,573
I'm sorry, by the way ...

183
00:24:38,608 --> 00:24:40,767
About you and Julia.

184
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:43,353
You know ... not working if i may ...

185
00:24:43,453 --> 00:24:49,159
I wanted to say something before you ran away but I,..I liked it.

186
00:24:49,678 --> 00:24:52,346
here, he's off the phone now.

187
00:28:28,383 --> 00:28:32,374
It's empty. The disks are empty.

188
00:28:47,297 --> 00:28:49,906
Check in, team leader.  

189
00:28:49,971 --> 00:28:52,754
Over. Repeat, check in, team leader.

190
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:54,523
Have you made it to the archive room?

191
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:57,600
Captain, one is in the archive!

192
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:02,148
Someone is pickybacking our frequency.

193
00:29:02,456 --> 00:29:07,351
Team leader, awaiting your go sign. Standing by to detonate.

194
00:29:07,582 --> 00:29:09,636
Abort!

195
00:29:12,388 --> 00:29:14,070
Rendezvous nod 2.

196
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,448
What is it?

197
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,737
Close the gate!

198
00:30:37,181 --> 00:30:39,686
Immediately!

199
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,551
Our media is no more thruthful than yours ...

200
00:32:31,552 --> 00:32:33,398
...American.

201
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,167
But we both know, that there'll cause of the explosion was you.

202
00:32:44,412 --> 00:32:49,638
Awaiting your go sign, Team leader. Standing by to detonate.

203
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:53,546
The worst part for you, team leader...

204
00:32:54,211 --> 00:33:00,886
is I'm the man assigned to make you suffer for it,
for what you did to my country.

205
00:33:02,886 --> 00:33:08,257
This is clinic, not a bar. 
Stop looking at me.

206
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,503
Misha, help me with him. Quick!

207
00:33:25,864 --> 00:33:29,459
I think you're proud to have survived.

208
00:33:40,063 --> 00:33:42,542
I have a few questions I would ask them.

209
00:33:44,134 --> 00:33:46,801
Watch where you walk!

210
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,465
- Go and get my car.
- Okay.

211
00:33:55,328 --> 00:33:56,482
Look there!

212
00:34:37,474 --> 00:34:39,346
Not a good idea. 

213
00:34:40,499 --> 00:34:42,837
Seem like one ... a minute ago.

214
00:35:23,137 --> 00:35:25,646
What are you doing? Damn!

215
00:35:25,681 --> 00:35:27,007
I can not believe it.

216
00:35:36,786 --> 00:35:39,538
All units, we have a fugitive. He took her to the west.

217
00:35:59,664 --> 00:36:02,987
Insolidated insurance. How may I help you?

218
00:36:02,522 --> 00:36:05,811
Search 20. Agent A2 delta echo requesting immediate "evac".

219
00:36:05,902 --> 00:36:08,156
Rendezvous Alpha 1-1-3.

220
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:12,084
Confirmed. Alpha 1-1-3.

221
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:48,269
Anna, Anna, Anna.

222
00:36:48,502 --> 00:36:51,134
I told myself ...

223
00:36:57,274 --> 00:36:59,751
We should leave town for a couple of days.

224
00:36:59,786 --> 00:37:02,796
Alex, you, me. Vacation.

225
00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:05,289
- Now?
- Tonight.

226
00:37:05,324 --> 00:37:07,239
Who we will go, father?

227
00:37:07,339 --> 00:37:10,978
just, just the three of us.

228
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,503
Where will we go?

229
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,706
Leonid?

230
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,736
(news) ...has been transported to anear hospital for treatment.

231
00:37:30,063 --> 00:37:31,807
While Russian Officials continue to blame

232
00:37:31,808 --> 00:37:33,023
a gas main break.

233
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:36,168
Experts has citing the shape of the blast area,

234
00:37:36,169 --> 00:37:38,839
and the size of debris field is more consistent with

235
00:37:38,874 --> 00:37:40,661
anonymous sand explosive. 

236
00:37:40,662 --> 00:37:44,732
Any speculations may have been an undeclared act of aggression.

237
00:37:45,101 --> 00:37:48,781
Although the Defence Ministry is maintaining that this is strictly an accident...

238
00:37:48,816 --> 00:37:51,806
Anna, pack a bag for Alex.

239
00:37:52,791 --> 00:37:55,342
We're leaving now.

240
00:37:55,598 --> 00:37:57,942
Anna.

241
00:37:58,556 --> 00:38:00,698
Anna.

242
00:38:11,946 --> 00:38:14,799
We have work to do.

243
00:38:43,665 --> 00:38:46,010
Mr. Secretary.

244
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:50,474
There's in no way you're in Russia.

245
00:38:50,509 --> 00:38:54,379
I'm not. Not since a bomb blew up the Kremlin.

246
00:38:58,441 --> 00:39:03,162
Yesterday I flew in to accept the order of friendship from Russian Prime Minister.

247
00:39:03,276 --> 00:39:06,126
Now I'm headed back to Washington,

248
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:08,977
to hand the President my resignation.

249
00:39:11,246 --> 00:39:14,518
My chief analyst, William Brandt.

250
00:39:15,467 --> 00:39:18,348
- A pen
- Pardon me?
- A pen.

251
00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:19,400
Here.

252
00:39:22,311 --> 00:39:25,086
Ethan, what happened in the Kremlin?

253
00:39:25,543 --> 00:39:27,080
Chief analyst you say?

254
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,597
- I'm implying that I made about a call ...
- Europian male.

255
00:39:30,024 --> 00:39:34,513
Fifties, about 6 foots, 180 pounds, blue eyes. Who is he?

256
00:39:36,313 --> 00:39:38,553
Crude drawing, but by your description..

257
00:39:39,038 --> 00:39:40,791
... that could be Kurt Hendricks.

258
00:39:40,892 --> 00:39:44,600
190 IQ, served in Swedish Special Forces.

259
00:39:44,635 --> 00:39:46,948
Professor of Physics, Stockholm University

260
00:39:46,983 --> 00:39:49,262
Specialist in nuclear and game theory.

261
00:39:49,381 --> 00:39:51,427
Asked to resign ...

262
00:39:52,322 --> 00:39:55,000
... Well, because he's crazy.

263
00:39:55,052 --> 00:39:57,533
Cobalt.

264
00:39:59,425 --> 00:40:01,253
You have to allert the Kremlin that one of their strategist

265
00:40:01,254 --> 00:40:02,836
has a nuclear launch device.

266
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:06,172
And what if his operative has the code activated

267
00:40:06,272 --> 00:40:08,588
What makes you say that?

268
00:40:08,941 --> 00:40:10,531
I saw him.

269
00:40:10,566 --> 00:40:13,220
Leaving the executive armory bag in hand, 

270
00:40:13,258 --> 00:40:15,474
he set off that explosion to cover his tracks.  

271
00:40:15,509 --> 00:40:18,780
It maybe weeks before the Russians know it's missing.

272
00:40:18,823 --> 00:40:20,487
- Unless we tell them.
- They won't listen to us.

273
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:25,197
As far as the Russian has concerned, we just bombed the Kremlin.

274
00:40:25,272 --> 00:40:28,726
Tension between United States and Russia, hasn't been this high

275
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:30,307
since the Cuban Missile Crisis.

276
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:35,247
And the blame, right or wrong, points to IMF.

277
00:40:40,123 --> 00:40:44,072
President has innitiated Ghost Protocol.

278
00:40:44,107 --> 00:40:48,337
The entire IMF has been disavowed.

279
00:40:50,276 --> 00:40:52,228
So what's happened now?

280
00:40:52,394 --> 00:40:55,802
Now I've been ordered to take you back to Washington.

281
00:40:55,837 --> 00:40:59,086
Where D.O.D  will labelled you as rough extremist, 

282
00:40:59,121 --> 00:41:02,335
and hang the Kremlin bombing on you and your team.

283
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,490
Unless ...

284
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:09,554
... you were to escape somewhere between here and the airport 

285
00:41:09,672 --> 00:41:13,479
airing on assaulted Mr. Brandt and me.

286
00:41:13,689 --> 00:41:15,071
Sir?

287
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:20,152
You will then illegally scrounge
 whatever material you could from backup supply cash..

288
00:41:20,187 --> 00:41:22,907
that I've overlooked the same cash..

289
00:41:22,942 --> 00:41:25,627
- ..for your team awaiting for further orders.
- Sir, you may wanna read ...

290
00:41:25,662 --> 00:41:27,545
You will then disappeared.

291
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,563
And this conversation never having taken place..

292
00:41:30,704 --> 00:41:33,786
but your intention would be unclear.

293
00:41:33,821 --> 00:41:37,190
But if anyone of your team is caught or killed,

294
00:41:37,225 --> 00:41:39,375
they will be branded terrorists,

295
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:44,011
out to incite a global nuclear war.

296
00:41:50,016 --> 00:41:51,861
Your mission.

297
00:41:52,395 --> 00:41:55,481
Should you choose to accept it.

298
00:41:59,854 --> 00:42:02,384
Ethan, you're my best man.

299
00:42:02,596 --> 00:42:04,755
And I'm sorry it's come to this,

300
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:07,652
after all the sacrifices you've made.

301
00:42:09,213 --> 00:42:12,174
We don't meet again, I just want you to know ...

302
00:42:12,828 --> 00:42:15,467
I will always consider you a friend ...

303
00:42:16,078 --> 00:42:18,767
Stay down. Drive, drive, drive!

304
00:42:44,724 --> 00:42:47,423
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

305
00:42:47,738 --> 00:42:50,144
Take deep breaths, stay with me. 

306
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,194
- ready?
- yes

307
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:18,175
What do we do?

308
00:43:18,958 --> 00:43:21,215
Wait here.

309
00:43:22,418 --> 00:43:24,954
Where else to might I go?

310
00:43:39,792 --> 00:43:41,632
Hey! hey, hey, hey.. There!

311
00:43:55,231 --> 00:43:57,552
Stop! Hold your fire!

312
00:43:58,376 --> 00:44:02,034
Hold your fire!

313
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:03,596
Enough!

314
00:44:04,662 --> 00:44:06,911
Perhaps more are still alive.

315
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:30,615
Today, in a nearby prison two inmates escaped.

316
00:44:38,957 --> 00:44:42,425
Who is this? What we know about him?

317
00:44:46,073 --> 00:44:48,259
Why would that work?

318
00:44:49,183 --> 00:44:51,621
- Why what work?
- The flare on the body.

319
00:44:51,656 --> 00:44:53,849
- What watt were they work?
- They did work.

320
00:44:53,884 --> 00:44:57,269
- Yeah, I know that...
- Hey!
- But why?

321
00:44:57,916 --> 00:45:01,177
- I mean, how did you know that would draw their fire? 
- I didn't.

322
00:45:01,287 --> 00:45:03,456
I played a hunch. 

323
00:45:04,196 --> 00:45:07,422
okay?
All right. What was your scenario?

324
00:45:07,457 --> 00:45:10,483
Right, there was a guy being shot at the water.

325
00:45:10,518 --> 00:45:13,977
All the sudden, such a light out of a flare, turn around?

326
00:45:14,646 --> 00:45:16,976
I mean, what you assume maybe thinking

327
00:45:17,403 --> 00:45:19,940
- thinking?
- yeah.

328
00:45:20,223 --> 00:45:21,860
I didn't assume they were thinking.

329
00:45:21,895 --> 00:45:24,032
I assumed they were shooting at anything to move

330
00:45:24,067 --> 00:45:26,383
and that just give them a target. But these ...

331
00:45:26,648 --> 00:45:29,399
These guys are not schollars, you know?

332
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:37,256
- This is really happening, isn't it?
- Yeah.

333
00:45:38,489 --> 00:45:41,645
- Okay. You know what that sound is?
- It's our ride out of here.

334
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,187
Our ride's green car, with 47.

335
00:45:47,981 --> 00:45:50,202
I see three.

336
00:45:50,653 --> 00:45:52,641
Okay, Let's do it! go, go, go, go!

337
00:45:55,991 --> 00:45:58,720
- All right. Forty-seven.
- I don't see it.
- Forty seven.

338
00:45:59,941 --> 00:46:01,940
Oh shit!

339
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:09,541
This is it. Where's the pass?

340
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:11,447
Enter your code.

341
00:46:17,754 --> 00:46:19,730

Retinal scan required.

344
00:46:28,734 --> 00:46:30,712
Watch out.

345
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,016
Retinal scan required.

346
00:46:33,112 --> 00:46:35,603
Agent confirmed.

347
00:46:48,317 --> 00:46:50,850

Geez, I thought you were died.

348
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,894
- We are.

349
00:46:52,929 --> 00:46:56,494

00:47:11,568 --> 00:47:14,054
Power of the world finally end.

353
00:47:15,752 --> 00:47:18,469
It is my job to predict the unthinkable.

354
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:23,615
To treat the death of billions as a game.

355
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:28,066
After 20 years of this, I was none.

356
00:47:28,665 --> 00:47:31,935
Until a new question crossed my mind.

357
00:47:32,567 --> 00:47:35,529
What happens after the end of the world?

358
00:47:35,564 --> 00:47:37,320
Are you sure your line is secure?

359
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,506
Every 2 or 3 million years ...

360
00:47:39,541 --> 00:47:42,194
Are you certain your line is secure?

361
00:47:42,229 --> 00:47:46,396
... some natural catastrophy devastates all life on earth.

362
00:47:46,669 --> 00:47:48,601
But life goes on.

363
00:47:48,877 --> 00:47:52,260
And what little remain is made stronger.

364
00:47:52,594 --> 00:47:56,168
Put simply world destruction, isn't unpleasant..

365
00:47:56,203 --> 00:47:59,268
..but necessary part of evolution.

366
00:48:01,597 --> 00:48:03,572
What happens then, I wondered.

367
00:48:03,712 --> 00:48:06,578
When mankind faces the next end of the world.

368
00:48:06,613 --> 00:48:09,299
I don't care what you have to do, to get him to Dubai.

369
00:48:09,334 --> 00:48:11,986
I'll make you worse as well. Just do it.

370
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,837
- I look to Hiroshima, Nagasaki.
- Well, I'll be waiting for your call.

371
00:48:15,872 --> 00:48:18,626
Thriving cities, rebuilt from the ashes.

372
00:48:18,661 --> 00:48:20,854
Monuments to unimaginable

373
00:48:20,889 --> 00:48:23,642
dedicated to the concept of peace.

374
00:48:23,643 --> 00:48:26,544
It's occured to me here, that nuclear war.. 

375
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:29,315
might have a place in the natural order.

376
00:48:29,688 --> 00:48:32,158
But only if it could be controlled.

377
00:48:32,244 --> 00:48:36,681
Only if attached every living song equally.

378
00:48:37,994 --> 00:48:42,402
IMF and I believe this man, Kurt Hendricks, is a nuclear extremist.

379
00:48:42,437 --> 00:48:44,279
Codename, Cobalt.

380
00:48:44,314 --> 00:48:46,737
Today he was seen leaving the Kremlin, that would most likely

381
00:48:46,738 --> 00:48:47,738
a nuclear launch device.

382
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:54,106
A few days ago, Sabine Moreau killed one of our agents in Budapest.

383
00:48:54,141 --> 00:48:56,745
We believe him off Russian nuclear launch code.

384
00:48:56,935 --> 00:49:01,341
Intel indicates she would check in the Burj Hotel in Dubai
in 36 hours.

385
00:49:02,574 --> 00:49:05,087
Mariusz Wistrom is known operative of Cobalt.

386
00:49:05,404 --> 00:49:07,690
Wistrom is currently on route to Dubai.

387
00:49:07,725 --> 00:49:11,384
For the launch device to work, Cobalt needs the activation codes.

388
00:49:11,419 --> 00:49:14,627
He's sending Wistrom, to buy them from Moreau.

389
00:49:15,416 --> 00:49:19,395
The Secretary is dead.

390
00:49:24,707 --> 00:49:27,627
The President has invoked Ghost Protocol.

391
00:49:28,329 --> 00:49:30,006
We're shut down.

392
00:49:30,041 --> 00:49:33,942
No satellites, safehouse, support or extraction.

393
00:49:33,943 --> 00:49:35,460
The four of us ...

394
00:49:35,712 --> 00:49:40,295
... and the content of this car
are all that remain of the IMF.

395
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:42,303
And as if this moment any actions are unsanctioned.

396
00:49:42,338 --> 00:49:46,225
So if you want out, speak now.

397
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:03,919
Our mission is Hendricks.

398
00:50:03,954 --> 00:50:07,335
We're all  distance between him and his goal,
nothing can be left to chance. 

399
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:10,716
Everyone connected with this man is considered an asset

400
00:50:10,751 --> 00:50:12,447
with valuable information about our target.

401
00:50:12,482 --> 00:50:14,108
No one can know we're still online.

402
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:16,664
We lose Hendricks now, we lose him forever.

403
00:50:16,699 --> 00:50:18,188
So, what's the plan?

404
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:20,816
Wistrom  will take delivery from Moreau in 36 hours.

405
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,136
Now we can not let the launch codes leave the hotel.

406
00:50:23,171 --> 00:50:26,255
But we need Wistrom to lead us to Hendricks.

407
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:28,590
Yeah, we only do that if he has the codes

408
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,891
- Or if he thinks he has it.
- Objective. ..

409
00:50:30,926 --> 00:50:32,575
... is to intercept the sale.

410
00:50:32,704 --> 00:50:34,453
Place the authentic codes with counterfeits.

411
00:50:34,488 --> 00:50:37,704
- and follow Wistrom to Hendricks.
- Well, that's, that's simple enough.

412
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:39,941
We just, we snatch the codes, we generate some fakes.

413
00:50:40,055 --> 00:50:43,391
Jane, you double Moreau and sell the codes to Wistrom.

414
00:50:43,426 --> 00:50:44,600
And bob your ankle.

415
00:50:44,635 --> 00:50:48,450
And how do you propose, that we just snatch the code from Moreau?

416
00:50:48,554 --> 00:50:50,473
You take her out.

417
00:50:51,641 --> 00:50:54,674
Yeah, we take her out,but you know, discreetly. 

418
00:50:54,883 --> 00:50:57,182
- Discreetly?
- Yeah.

419
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:00,224
- Right, she's an asset.
- Right.

420
00:51:00,259 --> 00:51:02,068
I get it. Sorry. Nothing left to chance, he said.

421
00:51:02,103 --> 00:51:04,481
I'm just, I'm a spit bowling. You know, it's not all gonna be go.

422
00:51:04,482 --> 00:51:07,893
- We don't touch Wistrom.. .
- All right.
-..or Moreau. 

423
00:51:09,726 --> 00:51:12,723
As you asked for Hanaway, but it has to be when I say.

424
00:51:12,758 --> 00:51:15,365
After we had Hendricks.

425
00:51:20,307 --> 00:51:22,258
- Only pack what we need.
- Yeah absolutely.

426
00:51:22,293 --> 00:51:24,210
Only pack what we need. You never know.

427
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:38,222
DUBAI

428
00:51:52,035 --> 00:51:55,152
So even if we can double Wistrom and Moreau,

429
00:51:55,187 --> 00:51:57,649
How do we keep them in separate rooms,

430
00:51:57,684 --> 00:52:00,112
Or having they think they are in the same room?

431
00:52:00,378 --> 00:52:02,372
We give the hotel a facelift.

432
00:52:02,407 --> 00:52:05,077
Wistrom will think he's arriving at Moreau's suite.

433
00:52:05,428 --> 00:52:07,782
But really, he will be walking into our decoy room. 

434
00:52:07,817 --> 00:52:09,391
Where I'll double Moreau.

435
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:11,393
Downstairs Benji will double Wistrom...

436
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:13,883
- a masks!
- And meet with real Moreau.

437
00:52:13,959 --> 00:52:17,476
And eh, huh, What am I doing?

438
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,745
You? You're the helper.

439
00:52:23,468 --> 00:52:25,989
Help ... okay.

440
00:52:26,104 --> 00:52:29,498
So, to the extent understand what are you talking about here  ...

441
00:52:30,622 --> 00:52:33,065
uhm, Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world.

442
00:52:33,348 --> 00:52:35,488
And you want to alter its infrastructure,

443
00:52:35,523 --> 00:52:37,556
with the hopes of convincing two people that

444
00:52:38,362 --> 00:52:41,591
they had a meeting, which actually really never happened ...

445
00:52:42,644 --> 00:52:44,685
Right?

446
00:52:52,072 --> 00:52:54,226
Camels.

447
00:53:40,397 --> 00:53:42,710
ETA on dry cleaning.

448
00:53:42,968 --> 00:53:45,061
I'm on my way out.

449
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,928
Okay, 34 minutes to doorknock.

450
00:53:56,501 --> 00:54:00,732
wow,.. ehm, okay. this, this is a slight wrinkle,.. nothing, nothing to worry about.

451
00:54:00,767 --> 00:54:04,478
We're just gonna have to go into server room, from the outside.

452
00:54:05,797 --> 00:54:10,473
- What?
- Well, the firewalls in this building serve a  military grade.

453
00:54:10,508 --> 00:54:13,467
I mean, this would be a synched if I could call Yusuf back at headquarter,

454
00:54:13,502 --> 00:54:15,882
but Yusuf doen't exist anymore, and neither do we.

455
00:54:15,917 --> 00:54:17,488
I could hack it, but it would take too long.

456
00:54:17,523 --> 00:54:18,636
Their hardware in.

457
00:54:18,637 --> 00:54:21,383
And there's four layers of an exchange security because not in server-in.

458
00:54:21,418 --> 00:54:23,871
and there is no way we can get into it from inside.

459
00:54:24,193 --> 00:54:28,770
If we can't get through the server, we don't control the elevators, we don't control security cameras.

460
00:54:28,961 --> 00:54:30,977
This operation is over even before it begins.

461
00:54:31,012 --> 00:54:32,994
I'm telling you we can get to it from outside.

462
00:54:33,029 --> 00:54:34,865
We?

463
00:54:35,051 --> 00:54:37,589
I'm,  I'm on the computer.

464
00:54:38,497 --> 00:54:42,328
I'm just a ... the helper.

465
00:54:45,364 --> 00:54:48,218
- What floor is it now?
- 130.

466
00:54:48,783 --> 00:54:51,525
130 ?

467
00:54:54,343 --> 00:54:55,632
- Vent out?
- pressure's unstiff.

468
00:54:55,633 --> 00:54:56,633
don't have enough time.

469
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:58,008
- Elevator shaft.
- infrared sensors.

470
00:54:58,009 --> 00:54:59,009
don't have enough time.

471
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:05,610
How am I suppose to do this?

472
00:55:11,017 --> 00:55:12,967
Dammit!

473
00:55:15,606 --> 00:55:17,907
Oh, that's high.

474
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:26,607
Okay, now remember, it's a rolling off motion, that disengages the bond.

475
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,840
When the emitter is blue, that's full adhesion.

476
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,880
Easy way to remember. "Blue is glue."

477
00:55:30,915 --> 00:55:32,821
- And when it's red?
- Dead.

478
00:55:32,921 --> 00:55:35,555
ah, here's your cutter, okay?
And your server interface.

479
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:36,711
Both going back here.

480
00:55:36,746 --> 00:55:38,391
One, two.

481
00:55:38,426 --> 00:55:41,091
Okay Ethan, holds-all service, 11 stories up  

482
00:55:41,092 --> 00:55:42,327
and 7 units over. 

483
00:55:42,841 --> 00:55:43,762
Okay?

484
00:55:44,075 --> 00:55:47,011
- Com check?
- Yeah, copy.

485
00:55:48,859 --> 00:55:50,616
So ...

486
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,007
It's 26 minutes to doorknock.

487
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:13,700
Yeah ...

488
00:56:53,771 --> 00:56:56,082
25 minutes to doorknock.

489
00:57:11,062 --> 00:57:13,055
What the hell is that?

490
00:57:27,498 --> 00:57:30,263
Hell, what the hell is that?

491
00:57:31,456 --> 00:57:33,805
It's a sandstorm.

492
00:57:35,331 --> 00:57:37,925
It's a long way off, Ethan. There's shouldn't be a problem.

493
00:57:40,847 --> 00:57:43,335
24 minutes to doorknock.

494
00:57:46,481 --> 00:57:48,450
Where is Ethan?

495
00:57:50,459 --> 00:57:52,748
You gotta be kidding me.

496
00:58:41,696 --> 00:58:44,534
23 minutes to doorknock.

497
00:59:03,051 --> 00:59:05,169
I'm in the server level.

498
00:59:27,505 --> 00:59:30,093
23 minutes to doorknock. 

499
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:33,163
Your countdown is not helping.

500
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:36,676
I'm just saying.

501
01:00:06,138 --> 01:00:08,918
- I'm in.
- That's great, Ethan. You're half way home.

502
01:00:16,491 --> 01:00:18,655
Located server.

503
01:00:24,626 --> 01:00:26,361
Please tell me we're online.

504
01:00:26,468 --> 01:00:28,415
All right, we're live.

505
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:30,362
Okay, now I have control of the elevators.

506
01:00:30,462 --> 01:00:33,056
- And the security cameras.
- Time to evacuate.

507
01:00:33,091 --> 01:00:35,918
Okay. You drive, and look out for Wistrom and Moreau.

508
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:54,063
Moreau is at the elevator. It has resceduled.

509
01:00:54,266 --> 01:00:55,749
Go.

510
01:01:00,972 --> 01:01:04,201
- We can't open this door, can  we?
- That door? No.

511
01:01:04,236 --> 01:01:06,743
Ethan you gotta get down here now.

512
01:01:07,262 --> 01:01:10,346
Ethan. Ethan. Is there a problem?

513
01:01:11,061 --> 01:01:12,667
Ethan? 

514
01:01:18,952 --> 01:01:21,650
- We're not gonna make it.
- We have to make it.

515
01:01:22,529 --> 01:01:24,320
Where is Ethan?

516
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:49,534
- Your line is not long enough!
- No, shit!

517
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:39,812
That was not easy, but I, I did it.

518
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:44,689
What I missed?

519
01:02:50,556 --> 01:02:54,066
The lense might be a little uncomfortable.

520
01:02:54,101 --> 01:02:57,609
It captures images and transmits them to the printer in the briefcase.

521
01:02:58,007 --> 01:02:59,887
- All right?
- hmm...

522
01:03:00,085 --> 01:03:02,273
I can't see, one eye right of it, fine.

523
01:03:02,308 --> 01:03:04,461
Blinks twice to activate the shutter.

524
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:08,357
Notice, the numbers are in order.

525
01:03:11,068 --> 01:03:13,504
A perfect copy.

526
01:03:13,937 --> 01:03:16,501
But the numbers are scrambled.

527
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:20,489
Masks? ah, 60 seconds.
Are you sure that I shouldn't wear a mask?

528
01:03:20,524 --> 01:03:22,767
You know, cause I'm not exactly Omar Sharif.

529
01:03:22,767 --> 01:03:25,135
I'll play a french. This is you tracking device.

530
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:26,990
- This is what you're tracking.
- paper clip?

531
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:28,697
No, it's a paper. It's in the briefcase.

532
01:03:28,697 --> 01:03:30,781
It's caught to be isotops, which should give a unique  ...

533
01:03:30,781 --> 01:03:33,157
- It just means that you can track documents, even if they switch briefcases.
- Range?

534
01:03:33,157 --> 01:03:35,596
- Not that good, like a half a mile (800 meters).

535
01:03:35,596 --> 01:03:37,884
Safest thing to do not let Wistrom out of your sight.

536
01:03:37,885 --> 01:03:39,534
Is that Wistrom?

537
01:03:43,981 --> 01:03:44,980
Who's out with him?

538
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:47,391
- I don't know.
- We don't have an uplink, so there's no facial recognition.

539
01:03:47,391 --> 01:03:49,843
Who's out with him?

540
01:03:50,228 --> 01:03:52,838
That's Leonid Lisenker. Polish phone cryptographer.

541
01:03:52,838 --> 01:03:56,097
He redesigned Russia's nuclear security at the Cold War. 

542
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:58,376
He set off to authenticate the launch codes.

543
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,105
- yeah shit, we are blown.
- No, no, no.

544
01:04:00,105 --> 01:04:02,941
Well, we'll would be as soon as he sees the counterfeit launch codes.

545
01:04:02,941 --> 01:04:05,290
- We're not alone.
- He's in the elevator.

546
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:07,467
Delay it.

547
01:04:15,767 --> 01:04:17,975
Benji, how long would take it reprogram the case?

548
01:04:17,975 --> 01:04:19,950
Ah, a couple seconds. Wow, What for that?

549
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:22,969
- To make an exact copy of the launch codes.
- What?!

550
01:04:22,969 --> 01:04:25,060
- You can't do that.
- Wistrom's on 22.

551
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:27,427
- Slow him down.
- I do what I can.

552
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:32,534
wait, wait, Ethan! Hey! Hang on now, hang on, just a second!

553
01:04:32,534 --> 01:04:36,033
You, you're talking about handing over active nuclear launch code to Wistrom?

554
01:04:36,033 --> 01:04:38,772
- the case, reprogram the case.
- Listen, listen, stop! Listen, listen.

555
01:04:38,966 --> 01:04:41,512
You're saying you're fixating, you're thinking clearly.

556
01:04:41,512 --> 01:04:43,333
Listen, that's not gonna happened!

557
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,691
- I won't allow it.
- 33, and climbing.

558
01:04:45,691 --> 01:04:49,066
Brandt, use your head. The mission is not the code, the mission is Hendricks.

559
01:04:49,066 --> 01:04:51,273
And this little play out, give him back codes neutralize it.

560
01:04:51,273 --> 01:04:53,269
You know that won't do it. Failure to a terrorist...

561
01:04:53,269 --> 01:04:55,260
...just a rehearsal for success.

562
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:56,529
41!

563
01:04:56,529 --> 01:04:58,928
We lose Hendricks today, he shows up somewhere else tomorrow.

564
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:01,632
He finds another way. With no IMF to stop him.

565
01:05:01,632 --> 01:05:03,950
Now, it's now or never. Now hand me the case.

566
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:06,115
Nothing left to chance. You said that ! 

567
01:05:06,115 --> 01:05:07,800
You're the analyst. Now tell me.. 

568
01:05:07,801 --> 01:05:09,419
..there's another way for Hendricks to get those codes.
- 50!

569
01:05:10,425 --> 01:05:13,226
You tell me that this is only happened 
right here, right now. Today!

570
01:05:13,226 --> 01:05:15,073
You tell me that, I'll walk away.

571
01:05:23,197 --> 01:05:24,953
- We go without!
- Without masks?

572
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:26,500
- Changes to go.
- Ethan!

573
01:05:26,501 --> 01:05:29,263
- We have no choice.
- Ethan, you will be walking on Moreau unarmed.

574
01:05:29,263 --> 01:05:31,986
- Face first. Literally.
- How do we know they've met?

575
01:05:31,987 --> 01:05:33,862
- How do we know they haven't?
- It doesn't matter!

576
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,848
Damn! We have no choice.

577
01:06:29,374 --> 01:06:30,822
Goggles.

578
01:06:33,003 --> 01:06:35,096
What if they have met?

579
01:06:36,991 --> 01:06:39,143
Come in.

580
01:07:13,859 --> 01:07:16,393
Which of one you is Wistrom?

581
01:07:16,954 --> 01:07:19,419
Which one of you is Wistrom?

582
01:07:21,318 --> 01:07:23,210
I am.

583
01:07:24,064 --> 01:07:26,571
I admire your work.

584
01:07:41,356 --> 01:07:43,369
Sit.

585
01:07:51,554 --> 01:07:53,618
Where are my codes?

586
01:07:54,546 --> 01:07:56,240
Where are my diamonds?

587
01:07:57,210 --> 01:07:59,039
close by.

588
01:07:59,648 --> 01:08:02,857
- You have my payment?
- When I see the codes.

589
01:08:03,763 --> 01:08:06,025
Not to worry. Come in!

590
01:08:06,368 --> 01:08:09,012
I thought we could have tea.

591
01:08:10,567 --> 01:08:12,993
Madam moiselle.

592
01:08:13,182 --> 01:08:15,386
Misseur.

593
01:08:15,386 --> 01:08:17,967
No diamonds, no codes.

594
01:08:18,152 --> 01:08:21,180
No codes, no diamonds.

595
01:08:24,795 --> 01:08:27,485
- Kill this one!
- We didn't came alone.

596
01:08:27,641 --> 01:08:29,700
That hole I lay out there is killbox.

597
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:32,511
- You know who we work for.
- We come back for its codes,

598
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:35,058
or we don't come back.

599
01:08:35,558 --> 01:08:38,476
- How good is your backup ?
- The best.

600
01:08:42,066 --> 01:08:44,201
Kill them the best.

601
01:08:45,069 --> 01:08:47,657
Do you care for some sugar?

602
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:52,966
Enough. Let's get this done.

603
01:08:52,966 --> 01:08:55,969
You want payment? I want guarantees.

604
01:08:56,071 --> 01:08:59,373
When he's authenticated the codes, I'll  make a call and get your diamonds.

605
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:02,170
That, or ...

606
01:09:02,308 --> 01:09:04,680
We alll go home in buckets.

607
01:09:05,222 --> 01:09:08,224
Nobody leaves this hotel alive.

608
01:09:11,628 --> 01:09:14,279
Get the papers .

609
01:09:27,232 --> 01:09:30,605
- Is there a problem?
- It's locked.

610
01:09:34,644 --> 01:09:37,518
Ah, forgive me.

611
01:09:37,518 --> 01:09:40,886
There must be a key. For momento.

612
01:09:44,372 --> 01:09:46,886
Misseur.

613
01:10:39,098 --> 01:10:42,983
My mistake. It is a combination. Not a key.

614
01:10:43,717 --> 01:10:46,449
You tell me the numbers!

615
01:10:51,342 --> 01:10:52,676
We're good.

616
01:10:52,676 --> 01:10:54,940
Zero

617
01:10:55,141 --> 01:10:57,048
zero

618
01:10:58,228 --> 01:10:59,922
zero

619
01:11:16,245 --> 01:11:18,272
Come on, come on, come on, came on, came on.

620
01:12:01,017 --> 01:12:03,194
It was a pleasure doing business with ...

621
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:05,668
Wistrom has launch codes and he's on the move.

622
01:12:06,002 --> 01:12:08,574
Hey, I did what you asked, I did!

623
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:11,479
- Now let my family go.
- Release Leonid's family.

624
01:12:11,596 --> 01:12:14,747
- Thank God!
- You can thank me in person.

625
01:12:29,546 --> 01:12:32,385
It was a pleasure doing business with you.

626
01:12:39,287 --> 01:12:41,259
Kill him!

627
01:12:48,936 --> 01:12:50,873
Moreau's on the move!

628
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:53,190
I've got her.

629
01:12:53,837 --> 01:12:56,010
Jane, she's an asset.

630
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:58,567
I need her alive.

631
01:12:59,492 --> 01:13:01,591
Acknowledge!

632
01:13:01,888 --> 01:13:04,026
Acknowledge!

633
01:13:14,633 --> 01:13:18,731
Ah, Ethan, Wistrom is in the elevator. I can't see Leonid there.

634
01:13:19,336 --> 01:13:22,852
Benji, slow it down. Give me an elevator.

635
01:13:34,636 --> 01:13:36,504
I'll handle it.

636
01:13:49,169 --> 01:13:53,023
Benji, I got a lot call of Wistrom, but I can't tell. Is he still in the elevator?

637
01:13:53,551 --> 01:13:56,505
- Wistrom ... elevator ...
- Benji?

638
01:14:00,021 --> 01:14:03,499
- Ethan, over!
- Benji. Benji, I lost.

639
01:14:03,499 --> 01:14:06,564
Ethan, can you hear me?
Ethan, can you hear me? over!

640
01:14:07,913 --> 01:14:09,625
Geez!

641
01:14:18,008 --> 01:14:19,874
- Watch her!
- Why, why me?

642
01:14:19,874 --> 01:14:22,579
If I'd do it, I'll kill her.

643
01:14:52,599 --> 01:14:57,066
Hold it, Team Leader.
Do you really think I wouldn't catch up of you?

644
01:14:57,066 --> 01:14:58,996
You and I are not enemies. It was a setup.

645
01:14:58,996 --> 01:15:03,029
We'll find out your lies soon enough. Move it!

646
01:15:04,716 --> 01:15:07,425
I'm sorry about this.

647
01:15:28,902 --> 01:15:29,823
Leonid!

648
01:15:29,824 --> 01:15:31,699
- Benji?
- Cover Benji!

649
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,935
I've got Leonid by the elevator, he's been shot.

650
01:15:33,935 --> 01:15:35,506
What?

651
01:15:46,188 --> 01:15:48,448
Hey, hey, stay with me, stay with me!

652
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,273
"No, no no no no no no no no no... 

653
01:16:15,666 --> 01:16:17,815
Jane, don't!

654
01:22:13,675 --> 01:22:15,218
Now what happened with Moreau, Jane?

655
01:22:15,218 --> 01:22:18,014
- She couldn't help us with...
- Yeah, so let's throw her off the building?

656
01:22:18,114 --> 01:22:20,161
- I didn't throw her!
- That's throw her off the building!

657
01:22:20,161 --> 01:22:22,687
She was not the mission, Jane.

658
01:22:22,687 --> 01:22:26,313
The mission was to track the file back to Hendricks.

659
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:29,586
Whose in the wind ...

660
01:22:50,686 --> 01:22:53,866
Better have good news for me. Is he here?

661
01:22:55,694 --> 01:22:58,816
I got it. Talk to you later. I'll be there.

662
01:22:58,816 --> 01:23:02,094
But no one will be following me. Just make sure no one's following you.

663
01:23:02,194 --> 01:23:04,852
- And how the hell that the Russians find us?
- Why do you ask me for?

664
01:23:05,009 --> 01:23:07,610
Because you are in communication. You in charge covering our tracks.

665
01:23:07,611 --> 01:23:10,647
We can not afford to make mistakes like that now, Benji.

666
01:23:10,647 --> 01:23:13,038
You are  not a technician anymore. You're field agent.

667
01:23:13,038 --> 01:23:15,127
And you're just an analyst?!

668
01:23:16,014 --> 01:23:18,526
Right? Right?

669
01:23:20,144 --> 01:23:23,127
Who are you really, Brandt?

670
01:23:23,649 --> 01:23:25,520
- What do you ask me?
- What am I asking?

671
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,413
Let me see if I can put in another ...

672
01:23:34,857 --> 01:23:39,179
How does an agent whose skills like that, end up an analyst?

673
01:23:46,896 --> 01:23:49,541
What if we all have secrets?

674
01:23:50,539 --> 01:23:53,223
tell me, Ethan.

675
01:23:57,018 --> 01:23:59,983
You tell me yours, I tell you mine.

676
01:24:12,374 --> 01:24:14,519
I'm all clear.

677
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:22,980
I have friends in the region. Just sit tight. I'll send someone to get you out of here.

678
01:24:23,192 --> 01:24:25,155
What about Hendricks? What's the plan?

679
01:24:25,156 --> 01:24:28,077
The plan was first to stop him together.

680
01:24:28,116 --> 01:24:31,402
- And what would you gonna do?
- Change the plan.

681
01:24:31,402 --> 01:24:33,510
Wait, that's it?

682
01:24:33,659 --> 01:24:35,996
What we gonna do? go after him alone?

683
01:24:37,907 --> 01:24:40,540
You can explain yourself, agent Brandt?

684
01:25:44,687 --> 01:25:47,513
I was in a protection detail in Croatia.

685
01:25:47,816 --> 01:25:51,101
Shadowing the assets, husband and wife.

686
01:25:52,151 --> 01:25:56,035
We were never suppose to know we were there. Whole things routines as in no crap. 

687
01:25:59,275 --> 01:26:05,521
Three years in,we caught wind that this Serbian hit squad was after our couple.

688
01:26:05,757 --> 01:26:09,654
But my team had it under control, I knew that they would coming.

689
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:15,315
But I couldn't shake this feeling that I should warn the couple somehow.

690
01:26:15,315 --> 01:26:18,383
I wanted to..  find the way to let them know

691
01:26:20,007 --> 01:26:23,133
But you know, orders are oders, so I didn't.

692
01:26:27,836 --> 01:26:32,210
One day, the husband decides to leave the hotel and go for a run.

693
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:33,798
So I followed him.

694
01:26:34,374 --> 01:26:37,113
And leave two men with the wife.

695
01:26:37,921 --> 01:26:40,058
When I get back,

696
01:26:40,058 --> 01:26:42,951
my guys were unconscious and the wife is gone.

697
01:26:43,875 --> 01:26:46,765
Local police found her body three days later.

698
01:26:47,881 --> 01:26:50,553
What was left over anyway.

699
01:26:55,502 --> 01:26:58,215
It was my last day on the field.

700
01:26:59,112 --> 01:27:02,461
I couldn't face another life or death situations after that.

701
01:27:02,461 --> 01:27:04,281
So, what happened with her husband?

702
01:27:04,495 --> 01:27:07,240
Never saw him again.

703
01:27:07,819 --> 01:27:12,653
Until two days ago, in Moscow, when the Secretary introduced me to Ethan Hunt.

704
01:27:16,285 --> 01:27:19,628
No, that's not what happened. She left him, you know.

705
01:27:19,622 --> 01:27:22,597
I heard that one too, Benji.

706
01:27:22,853 --> 01:27:26,481
But, unfortunately, I was there.

707
01:27:27,227 --> 01:27:30,953
Just like I was there when the Secretary got the phone call..

708
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:35,491
..that Ethan was in custody for killing 6 Serbian nationals  in cold blood.

709
01:27:35,609 --> 01:27:37,690
- ah, I'm sorry, shouldn't hit?
- Yeah.

710
01:27:37,734 --> 01:27:40,769
Disavowed.

711
01:27:48,153 --> 01:27:52,629
Last thing I know ... I am on the plane to Dubai.

712
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:57,776
Wondering the old time ... Do I tell him?

713
01:27:59,766 --> 01:28:02,512
How do I tell him?

714
01:28:03,457 --> 01:28:06,185
That I'm responsible.

715
01:28:07,926 --> 01:28:11,093
I could've warned him. I should've warned him.

716
01:28:13,652 --> 01:28:15,915
But I didn't.

717
01:28:16,956 --> 01:28:19,210
And she died.

718
01:28:24,846 --> 01:28:28,435
Sergei! Sergei, my friend!

719
01:28:28,435 --> 01:28:31,498
I told you, I was gathered here. Didn't I say?

720
01:28:31,498 --> 01:28:33,669
- I don't know it's him?
- Yes, it's him.

721
01:28:33,791 --> 01:28:36,004
You trust me, I trust you, right?

722
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:41,024
This is the guy! This is the guy, 
the one I told you about.

723
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:43,988
So, we can take these things off.

724
01:28:48,455 --> 01:28:51,637
Sorry, he's a great guy, but he doesn't know you like I do,
you understand.

725
01:28:51,637 --> 01:28:54,611
So, you work for American government?

726
01:28:55,835 --> 01:28:59,737
- And you are an arm stealer.
- No, no! Sergei, Sergei!

727
01:29:00,423 --> 01:29:04,517
He's independent defense coordinator, right?

728
01:29:05,589 --> 01:29:07,591
That's right, very classic job.

729
01:29:07,591 --> 01:29:10,337
- Listen, he's a friend.
- Those diamonds are for Bogdan.

730
01:29:10,338 --> 01:29:12,278
No, no, it's okay. He can have it.

731
01:29:12,593 --> 01:29:16,049
Whatever arrangements you made with my cousin, it's between you and him.

732
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:18,795
You want something from me, you pay.

733
01:29:18,795 --> 01:29:21,700
You misunderstand. I am not buying.

734
01:29:21,794 --> 01:29:23,606
I'm selling.

735
01:29:23,743 --> 01:29:25,830
You selling?

736
01:29:26,009 --> 01:29:28,873
- Selling what?
- The future.

737
01:29:29,523 --> 01:29:31,513
Yeah, I got all I need, thank you.

738
01:29:31,513 --> 01:29:34,033
Our countries are on the break of war.

739
01:29:34,033 --> 01:29:36,322
War is very good for business.

740
01:29:36,322 --> 01:29:39,022
Nuclear war?

741
01:29:48,207 --> 01:29:49,415
Go on.

742
01:29:49,415 --> 01:29:52,571
I'm looking for a man named Kurt Hendricks. You may know him as Cobalt.

743
01:29:52,671 --> 01:29:55,538
In this case, I think you know what he wants.

744
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:58,764
I bet he even try to buy it from you at some point.

745
01:29:59,819 --> 01:30:03,277
- Go on.
- He has a case, he has codes.

746
01:30:03,608 --> 01:30:06,656
But they're worthless without tactical satellite.

747
01:30:07,186 --> 01:30:10,080
I want to know where he get it.

748
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:13,990
A man with information like that would be a potential terrorist.

749
01:30:14,565 --> 01:30:21,106
And to your government, a potential terrorist is a terrorist.

750
01:30:23,499 --> 01:30:26,019
Do you help me?

751
01:30:26,019 --> 01:30:30,004
My friends become your friends.

752
01:30:32,082 --> 01:30:35,949
Sorry. I can not help you.

753
01:30:41,585 --> 01:30:46,164
I certainly can not tell you that, Russia quitely sold an obselete technical satellite...

754
01:30:46,164 --> 01:30:49,656
to a certain telecom in Mumbai.

755
01:30:50,387 --> 01:30:53,500
And who ever gave them that idea?

756
01:30:54,109 --> 01:30:56,559
An enterprising third party. 

757
01:30:56,559 --> 01:30:58,040
Working on commission.

758
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:01,793
Helping old friends, making new ones.

759
01:31:01,793 --> 01:31:05,399
- Can the satellite be shut down?
- That would take a special skills then.

760
01:31:06,319 --> 01:31:08,642
You can not do it alone.

761
01:31:33,915 --> 01:31:36,727
- What's in the bags?
- It's our gear.

762
01:31:37,098 --> 01:31:40,533
- How'd you get it?
- Made a friend.

763
01:31:41,339 --> 01:31:44,083
- I'm glad we could help.
- You can help now.

764
01:31:44,986 --> 01:31:47,600
- Look Ethan, before...
- Whatever happened, happened. 

765
01:31:47,601 --> 01:31:53,083
We still have a chance to clean this up.
But we have to do it now, we have to do it together.

766
01:31:59,913 --> 01:32:02,403
Yeah sure, where are we going?

767
01:32:03,215 --> 01:32:05,363
India.

768
01:32:08,793 --> 01:32:11,442
- India? India?
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

769
01:32:15,176 --> 01:32:17,180
Love the jet!

770
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:19,602
Where do you see the car?

771
01:32:25,846 --> 01:32:28,445
- Sidorov.
- (in Russian) What are you doing, man?

772
01:32:28,445 --> 01:32:30,392
You were ...

773
01:32:30,858 --> 01:32:34,033
I was worried for nothing.

774
01:32:38,655 --> 01:32:42,803
- I heard that you're looking for an American..
- Continue.

775
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:49,513
And launching devices were stolen yesterday.

776
01:32:50,234 --> 01:32:54,599
- Seriously?
- I can help you find them.

777
01:32:54,599 --> 01:32:57,890
If you agree with that.

778
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:04,740
Brij Nath.

779
01:33:04,740 --> 01:33:07,161
Brij Nath. Playboy. Multimedia tycoon.

780
01:33:07,566 --> 01:33:10,700
On the surface, this turn network as state of the art

781
01:33:10,814 --> 01:33:14,150
but its  build time illegally acquired Cold War cast off 

782
01:33:14,150 --> 01:33:16,095
including this,the Novosti satellite.

783
01:33:16,289 --> 01:33:18,087
Hendricks needs it to launch a nuclear strike,

784
01:33:18,087 --> 01:33:21,020
and we have to shut it down, before he gets that chance.

785
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:23,807
And to do that we need to get the acess codes from him,

786
01:33:23,807 --> 01:33:25,838
one way or another.

787
01:33:26,112 --> 01:33:28,398
And if I don't ...

788
01:33:28,624 --> 01:33:31,381
None of this works.

789
01:33:31,381 --> 01:33:34,122
- You can do this.
- Yeah.

790
01:33:34,528 --> 01:33:37,305
A week ago I would've believed you.

791
01:33:42,538 --> 01:33:45,412
I don't blame you for what happened.

792
01:33:49,807 --> 01:33:52,975
She took someone you cared about. That just not something ...

793
01:33:54,097 --> 01:33:55,920
...you just, let go.

794
01:33:56,559 --> 01:34:00,163
Did that make you feel better?

795
01:34:01,061 --> 01:34:04,045
When you kill the man who killed your wife?

796
01:34:12,042 --> 01:34:14,684
We can't get them back.

797
01:34:20,328 --> 01:34:24,354
Okay, to shut down the satellite we have to manually tap into the central server. 

798
01:34:24,521 --> 01:34:28,150
And you'll enter through the exhaust vent wearing this under your suit.

799
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:30,346
I'll drop down into the computer ray

800
01:34:30,346 --> 01:34:32,727
and I'll catch you, and we have you along the relay room

801
01:34:32,727 --> 01:34:34,911
and you jack into the panel.

802
01:34:38,119 --> 01:34:40,805
Okay, so we enter the party separately as guests

803
01:34:40,805 --> 01:34:43,537
Ethan quarterbacks, while Jane gets the codes ...

804
01:34:43,538 --> 01:34:46,398
from billionaire, I switch off the vent, you jump into the computer,

805
01:34:46,398 --> 01:34:48,422
and I'll catch you, you plug in the transmitter,

806
01:34:48,422 --> 01:34:52,081
Ethan feeds me the codes, which I then use to pinpoit Hendricks' location.

807
01:34:52,081 --> 01:34:55,470
okay, you breach over something,  

808
01:34:55,470 --> 01:35:00,387
I think it really important to computer array, part,..
or I just,.. jump?

809
01:35:01,015 --> 01:35:02,870
- And I catch you.
- Yeah.

810
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:05,070
I don't,.. Why is it so hard to grasp?

811
01:35:05,266 --> 01:35:09,355
what, why? it, it's 25 foot drop..

812
01:35:09,893 --> 01:35:12,086
- and it's using magnets.
- Yeah

813
01:35:13,176 --> 01:35:16,630
In lye of our recent efforts, the technology is. ..

814
01:35:16,630 --> 01:35:20,276
Science is sign. I'd be more worried about the heat.

815
01:35:21,454 --> 01:35:23,692
And then there is that... What heat?

816
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:26,850
Well it's like any computer, isn't it?
If you switch off the fan, 

817
01:35:27,030 --> 01:35:29,040
it's gonna get really hot.

818
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:31,160
- Of course.
- Relatively, you know.

819
01:35:32,978 --> 01:35:36,637
Of course it will. So I'm jumping into a ...

820
01:35:37,962 --> 01:35:41,053
... an oven.
acentually.

821
01:35:41,419 --> 01:35:43,042
Yeah, acentually. 

822
01:35:43,306 --> 01:35:46,599
But ...uhm, I'll catch you.

823
01:35:47,559 --> 01:35:49,767
Great.

824
01:35:54,349 --> 01:35:59,440
MUMBAI

825
01:37:11,401 --> 01:37:13,390
Com check?

826
01:37:13,490 --> 01:37:15,953
Saturn got you 5 by 5, Jupiter.

827
01:37:17,892 --> 01:37:19,814
This is Pluto.

828
01:37:21,450 --> 01:37:23,888
I have arrived at the party.

829
01:37:27,151 --> 01:37:29,572
There he is.

830
01:37:40,261 --> 01:37:43,235
Get us that code.

831
01:37:50,786 --> 01:37:53,195
Venus is moving-in on target.

832
01:38:04,305 --> 01:38:06,557
Hook's in.

833
01:38:07,795 --> 01:38:10,409
you do make an impression.

834
01:38:13,583 --> 01:38:15,933
Why am I Pluto? It's even not a planet anymore.

835
01:38:16,547 --> 01:38:19,124
I think Uranus is available.

836
01:38:19,222 --> 01:38:21,256
Hehehe..
It's funny cause you said "anus".

837
01:38:35,302 --> 01:38:37,808
- I'm in position.
- Sending in the robot.

838
01:38:43,085 --> 01:38:45,753
He's moving to you. In your back.

839
01:38:46,839 --> 01:38:50,261
- Don't wanna make it too easy for him.
- We can be talking all the time.

840
01:38:51,399 --> 01:38:54,960
In 20 minutes I want a glass of Cuvée Louis on every guest's hand.

841
01:38:55,081 --> 01:38:57,897
And make sure all of them have  a bottle take home by the end of the night.

842
01:39:02,659 --> 01:39:04,885
Impressed yet?

843
01:39:05,099 --> 01:39:07,477
I'm more a Bourbon girl.

844
01:39:12,606 --> 01:39:16,283
I am Brij Nath. Welcome to my humble home.

845
01:39:38,995 --> 01:39:41,290
And.. robot's in position.

846
01:39:42,116 --> 01:39:44,350
spinning down the turbine.

847
01:39:51,390 --> 01:39:55,712
He's emailing. Venus, V Venus, V Venus.

848
01:40:04,259 --> 01:40:07,545
Husband? Boyfriend?

849
01:40:08,111 --> 01:40:12,175
More of the co-worker.

850
01:40:12,175 --> 01:40:14,827
Saturn, take the lead.

851
01:40:18,598 --> 01:40:20,960
Okay.

852
01:40:29,523 --> 01:40:32,813
- jump now?
- Yes, commit jump!

853
01:40:32,951 --> 01:40:34,100
- Jump?
- Jump!

854
01:40:34,101 --> 01:40:37,011
- And I catch you.
- Now!

855
01:40:40,012 --> 01:40:43,515
So, ah, you sure about the suit, right, Benji?

856
01:40:43,515 --> 01:40:45,796
Pretty sure.

857
01:40:46,024 --> 01:40:48,259
Now you're pretty sure?

858
01:40:49,035 --> 01:40:50,768
Jump!

859
01:40:51,305 --> 01:40:53,444
O God!

860
01:40:54,331 --> 01:40:56,222
Jump!

861
01:40:56,636 --> 01:40:58,319
Jump!

862
01:41:15,708 --> 01:41:17,949
Jupiter, he's gone.

863
01:41:22,711 --> 01:41:25,707
- Did you jump?
- Should I not in jump?

864
01:41:26,691 --> 01:41:29,179
Cause I jumped!

865
01:41:29,913 --> 01:41:32,031
Stand by.

866
01:41:39,299 --> 01:41:43,376
I'm playing a hunch. Don't hit me.

867
01:42:00,628 --> 01:42:01,910
Hello?

868
01:42:01,910 --> 01:42:05,992
My God, you are a passionate creature.

869
01:42:07,650 --> 01:42:10,772
I would like to show you my collection of art.

870
01:42:11,306 --> 01:42:15,038
- I was waiting for you to ask.
- Then you have to find me.

871
01:42:15,642 --> 01:42:18,404
- come on.
- I'm heading upstairs.

872
01:42:36,634 --> 01:42:39,459
All right, and be careful.
It probably getting a bit hot.

873
01:42:40,149 --> 01:42:42,866
You have to get to that satellite, before Hendricks does.

874
01:42:59,406 --> 01:43:03,504
Look left, look up. 
I find your complicious passion intriguing.

875
01:43:04,356 --> 01:43:10,686
You can keep repeat telling anyone, but he's not your type.
completely not your type.
He's completely cold, I'm hot.

876
01:43:11,969 --> 01:43:14,487
Like all Indian men are very hot.

877
01:43:14,587 --> 01:43:18,667
8 o'clock, he's at your 8 o'clock.

878
01:43:18,667 --> 01:43:21,855
As you walk toward me, you're getting hotter.

879
01:43:25,318 --> 01:43:27,740
It's too much! too much, too much!

880
01:43:31,841 --> 01:43:33,923
I see you.

881
01:43:34,943 --> 01:43:38,463
I heard you have one of the finest private collections in the world.

882
01:43:38,463 --> 01:43:41,406
Well, of the very licensed private  .

883
01:44:00,130 --> 01:44:02,222
Saturn, how are we doing in Relay room?

884
01:44:02,222 --> 01:44:04,390
in position.

885
01:44:05,962 --> 01:44:08,078
I see the satellite .

886
01:44:13,737 --> 01:44:16,640
- Can I help you gentlemen?
- I don't think so.

887
01:44:22,991 --> 01:44:25,260
I need those codes, guys.

888
01:44:33,463 --> 01:44:36,540
All originals from Shatpur district

889
01:44:39,781 --> 01:44:42,257
You know the tantrics believe ...

890
01:44:43,528 --> 01:44:47,844
That there's lust chakra hide on most subconscious of desires..

891
01:45:40,126 --> 01:45:44,319
Uplink to satellite. Reboot to original military specs.

892
01:45:44,363 --> 01:45:46,921
Download the virus.

893
01:45:54,132 --> 01:45:56,367
What hell is that?

894
01:45:57,304 --> 01:45:59,543
- What the hell is that?
- What the hell's what?

895
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:02,851
- It's going haywire!
- It downloaded the virus from the satellite.

896
01:46:02,851 --> 01:46:05,888
Hendricks is killing the server, before we can count the satellite. 

897
01:46:05,888 --> 01:46:07,787
Hendricks is reprogramming the satellite.  

898
01:46:07,787 --> 01:46:10,523
He's gonna lost its capabilty in five minutes.

899
01:46:11,181 --> 01:46:13,600
- Is something wrong?
- No.

900
01:46:13,706 --> 01:46:16,359
Jane, you gotta move. We need that code.

901
01:46:16,359 --> 01:46:19,137
Finally we are alone.

902
01:46:25,813 --> 01:46:29,317
Venus, now is your turn.
You kick his ass and get the code.

903
01:46:30,187 --> 01:46:33,866
We are alone, aren't we?

904
01:46:33,876 --> 01:46:37,387
No one will interrupt us.

905
01:46:40,755 --> 01:46:42,803
Move and I break your neck!

906
01:46:42,803 --> 01:46:45,298
The override sequence for the relay station.

907
01:46:45,412 --> 01:46:48,040
Say it now, and never speak again!

908
01:46:49,014 --> 01:46:50,927
The codes!

909
01:46:51,049 --> 01:46:55,882
46-82-123.

910
01:46:58,693 --> 01:47:01,679
- Benji, what happened?
- The system crashed, we're too late.

911
01:47:01,761 --> 01:47:03,371
No, no, no. He reveals himself.

912
01:47:03,371 --> 01:47:05,510
Benji, can you pinpoint Hendricks location?

913
01:47:06,522 --> 01:47:10,331
Hendricks is signaling at a state room tv station 6.7 miles from here.

914
01:47:10,333 --> 01:47:13,381
Send me the coordinates. Good work Brandt.
Now, get the hell out of there.

915
01:47:13,416 --> 01:47:14,471
Back me up!

916
01:47:14,471 --> 01:47:17,741
Jane, time over on Nath. Meet me at the rally point.

917
01:47:22,421 --> 01:47:24,157
Sweet love.

918
01:47:24,434 --> 01:47:26,977
Faster, Benji. Just through it trough.

919
01:47:30,510 --> 01:47:33,367
Wait, stop! Take me through.

920
01:47:33,602 --> 01:47:37,023
It's not responding. 
A liitle bit of patient would be appreciated.

921
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:54,881
ah, can't reach the top!

922
01:47:56,243 --> 01:47:59,399
more fan, more fan, more fan!

923
01:47:59,645 --> 01:48:01,883
There's nothing I can do, it maxed out.

924
01:48:20,169 --> 01:48:22,203
Brandt?

925
01:48:22,759 --> 01:48:26,482
Next time, I gonna seduce the rich guy.

926
01:48:37,014 --> 01:48:39,352
Satellite's weaponized and online.

927
01:48:39,446 --> 01:48:41,706
Upload the new authentication codes.

928
01:48:41,706 --> 01:48:44,098
Lock Russian Central Command out of the system.

929
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:47,596
Isolate the sub, with fire just one missile.

930
01:48:47,596 --> 01:48:50,648
An apparent retaliation for the Kremlin.

931
01:48:50,887 --> 01:48:52,838
That should start the ball running.

932
01:48:52,951 --> 01:48:54,451
I am here, Ethan.

933
01:48:54,452 --> 01:48:56,972
How long it till Hendricks can launch the missile? 

934
01:48:56,973 --> 01:48:58,903
Less than 30 seconds.

935
01:49:00,312 --> 01:49:02,302
Find another route.

936
01:49:03,217 --> 01:49:05,647
Turn left, up ahead, take the only way on the right.

937
01:49:20,016 --> 01:49:21,869
We have uplink.

938
01:49:31,892 --> 01:49:34,317
Ethan, Hendricks has started launch sequence.

939
01:49:34,317 --> 01:49:37,122
- How much time till the missiles are flight ?
- Three minutes!

940
01:49:41,285 --> 01:49:43,703
We're three  and half minutes out.

941
01:49:46,185 --> 01:49:48,290
We can make it.

942
01:49:49,141 --> 01:49:50,520
We can make it.

943
01:49:50,738 --> 01:49:54,158
Magellan Strait Pacific Ocean 

944
01:49:56,755 --> 01:49:58,563
Captain!

945
01:50:02,473 --> 01:50:05,544
Call the head office to ask if approved launching missiles.

946
01:50:05,545 --> 01:50:06,545
I understand!

947
01:50:07,798 --> 01:50:10,770
Iron gun start operation.

948
01:50:10,770 --> 01:50:13,010
Confirm the order of attack.

949
01:50:13,010 --> 01:50:15,206
Stop communication devices.

950
01:50:15,206 --> 01:50:17,328
Done.

951
01:50:18,731 --> 01:50:20,836
Next left.

952
01:50:33,155 --> 01:50:35,035
Continue.

953
01:50:55,247 --> 01:50:57,584
Ethan, we're too late.

954
01:50:57,717 --> 01:50:59,819
The missile's in the air.

955
01:51:11,999 --> 01:51:13,989
There has to be a way to abort the warhead.

956
01:51:13,989 --> 01:51:15,753
If there is a wild on the launch device.

957
01:51:15,753 --> 01:51:18,221
We gonna get that case!

958
01:51:27,701 --> 01:51:31,063
May there be peace on Earth.

959
01:51:35,307 --> 01:51:37,734
Disable the relay!

960
01:51:38,237 --> 01:51:40,405
Get Wistrom!
Inside, inside!

961
01:52:14,931 --> 01:52:16,706
Wistrom destroyed the relay.

962
01:52:16,706 --> 01:52:19,084
- Ethan ran after Hendricks and case, but..
- It doesn't matter if he has the case.

963
01:52:19,084 --> 01:52:20,700
We can't transmit the abort codes.

964
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:24,522
- Can you fix it?
- ah yeah, but it's gonna be pointless we don't have any power.

965
01:52:24,557 --> 01:52:26,102
Wistrom!

966
01:52:27,534 --> 01:52:29,918
- Jane?
- I'm okay.

967
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:33,335
oh, you are not okay, she's hit.

968
01:52:33,598 --> 01:52:35,135
You stay here and cover Benji. 

969
01:52:35,135 --> 01:52:38,456
- Benji, get the single wire back online!
- I get the power on.

970
01:52:38,456 --> 01:52:39,630
We can do this.

971
01:55:54,076 --> 01:55:57,531
I'm taking that briefcase!

972
01:56:00,767 --> 01:56:02,815
No, no!

973
01:56:49,546 --> 01:56:51,326
- He's been gone too long.
- Dammit!

974
01:56:51,326 --> 01:56:55,362
Listen, when the power comes on, 
this two drives are going to this bay, okay?

975
01:57:39,322 --> 01:57:42,207
Mission... 
accomplished!

976
01:57:52,579 --> 01:57:54,308
Damn!

977
01:58:23,167 --> 01:58:25,041
Do not shoot!

978
01:58:31,232 --> 01:58:33,389
This one is mine.

979
01:58:45,151 --> 01:58:48,670
So we are not enemies?

980
01:58:49,768 --> 01:58:53,235
There a phone call from that arm stealer in Dubai.

981
01:58:53,235 --> 01:58:56,298
You wanted me to find you.

982
01:58:58,569 --> 01:59:01,548
How else to deal with all these?

983
01:59:08,351 --> 01:59:11,307
hospital?

984
01:59:13,988 --> 01:59:17,963
SEATTLE

985
01:59:17,963 --> 01:59:20,590
(news) ...some sort of aircraft.

986
01:59:20,590 --> 01:59:24,237
but officials of Department of Defense  insisted was simply 
a meteor...

987
01:59:24,237 --> 01:59:26,771
large enough to be visible during daylight.

988
01:59:26,771 --> 01:59:28,923
You actually said that?

989
01:59:28,923 --> 01:59:32,242
Outloud? 
Mission accomplished?

990
01:59:32,642 --> 01:59:35,865
- I said it.
- You're still cornered Ethan.

991
01:59:36,261 --> 01:59:38,986
And I can't imagine the look on that guy's face.

992
01:59:40,635 --> 01:59:42,882
- Hey
- These must be them.

993
01:59:42,791 --> 01:59:46,491
Luther Stickell, the affirmative,  Carter, Dunn and Brandt.

994
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:51,471
I borrowed an entire week in the bottom of the San Francisco bay

995
01:59:52,512 --> 01:59:54,777
Well thanks to you class..

996
01:59:57,147 --> 01:59:59,408
How do you know I got this ...

997
01:59:59,408 --> 02:00:02,555
I know. I see you in Kandahar.

998
02:00:05,827 --> 02:00:08,127
Hey thanks for meeting me.

999
02:00:08,127 --> 02:00:10,784
So, I heard the insurance companies refused into pay the claim

1000
02:00:10,785 --> 02:00:12,783
on that car you crashed, Ethan.

1001
02:00:12,784 --> 02:00:16,602
Something about intentional a hundred meters that could drop not being covered.

1002
02:00:16,611 --> 02:00:18,334
Go figured.

1003
02:00:21,262 --> 02:00:24,248
- How's the leg?
- Still working.

1004
02:00:25,219 --> 02:00:27,682
- You?
- Healing.

1005
02:00:29,776 --> 02:00:32,030
I'm fine, by the way.

1006
02:00:32,030 --> 02:00:35,715
But I'm not actually sleeping per say, you know. 

1007
02:00:35,715 --> 02:00:37,437
Caught sweats, middle of the night.

1008
02:00:38,287 --> 02:00:41,037
All these people are just happy and smiling,

1009
02:00:41,037 --> 02:00:45,266
and they are completely oblivious,
for the fact they were almost...vaporized.

1010
02:00:46,104 --> 02:00:49,408
- and if I've been inferred...
- Dumb luck?

1011
02:00:49,931 --> 02:00:51,244
Was it?

1012
02:00:52,247 --> 02:00:55,990
I mean, look, we were unprepared, in the dark,

1013
02:00:55,990 --> 02:00:58,062
disavowed.

1014
02:00:58,570 --> 02:01:00,841
The only thing that functioned properly

1015
02:01:01,317 --> 02:01:03,590
on that mission,

1016
02:01:04,049 --> 02:01:06,214
was this team.

1017
02:01:07,330 --> 02:01:09,978
I don't know how we ended up together,

1018
02:01:11,874 --> 02:01:14,254
but I'm glad we did.

1019
02:01:20,668 --> 02:01:22,968
Your missions.

1020
02:01:22,968 --> 02:01:25,519
Choose to accept them.

1021
02:01:30,177 --> 02:01:31,836
all right ... you know, I am in.

1022
02:01:32,129 --> 02:01:35,912
Seriously, this is not as hard as any mission gonna rougher than the last one, is it?

1023
02:01:37,654 --> 02:01:40,628
It's just ... a bomb, is it?

1024
02:01:58,914 --> 02:02:01,578
- Thanks, Ethan.
- I thank you.

1025
02:02:03,710 --> 02:02:06,622
- Agent Hunt.
- Agent Carter.

1026
02:02:14,962 --> 02:02:17,107
Brandt.

1027
02:02:19,202 --> 02:02:23,767
I'm not picking up that phone Ethan, because I don't think you want me the field

1028
02:02:26,522 --> 02:02:29,193
I know your wife is dead.

1029
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:33,762
I was there in Croatia.

1030
02:02:34,656 --> 02:02:37,367
I was there for one reason. One.

1031
02:02:38,392 --> 02:02:40,724
And I failed.

1032
02:02:44,152 --> 02:02:46,393
It was my job to protect her.

1033
02:02:46,393 --> 02:02:49,326
How do you know she's dead?

1034
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:55,944
- where's the body?
- Did you see it?

1035
02:02:57,690 --> 02:03:00,786
- You killed those Serbians.
- I had to get her back.

1036
02:03:00,786 --> 02:03:02,632
You sent out to rankout prison.

1037
02:03:02,632 --> 02:03:04,551
That was a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

1038
02:03:04,551 --> 02:03:07,936
IMF suspected that Hendricks had people in rankout.

1039
02:03:10,233 --> 02:03:13,299
And six dead Serbians was your idea of cover?

1040
02:03:14,567 --> 02:03:17,346
I always not one, not

1041
02:03:33,349 --> 02:03:36,111
Secretary never told me.

1042
02:03:39,365 --> 02:03:42,757
I accepted the direct call prison mission on one condition.

1043
02:03:42,757 --> 02:03:45,994
No one can know she's still alive.

1044
02:03:46,518 --> 02:03:49,568
But ... you telling me.

1045
02:03:56,925 --> 02:03:59,945
When did you find out that I was in Croatia?

1046
02:04:00,046 --> 02:04:04,400
- I put your file, after India.
- Great.

1047
02:04:06,266 --> 02:04:09,359
So, you had to fake your wife's death.

1048
02:04:09,911 --> 02:04:13,158
As long as we're together, she can never be safe.

1049
02:04:13,926 --> 02:04:16,744
It wasn't your job to protect her, Brandt.

1050
02:04:19,214 --> 02:04:21,423
It's mine.

1051
02:04:27,608 --> 02:04:31,539
- So we're good?
- We're good.

1052
02:05:52,900 --> 02:05:54,378
Good evening, Mr. Hunt.

1053
02:05:54,378 --> 02:05:58,324
36 hours ago, there was a breach on military's communication network.

1054
02:05:58,324 --> 02:06:02,982
Now, an emerging terror organization known as the Syndicate,

1055
02:06:02,982 --> 02:06:04,358
has control over entire drone fleet.

1056
02:06:04,358 --> 02:06:11,093
Your targets: unknown.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it...

1057
02:06:11,093 --> 02:06:28,093
