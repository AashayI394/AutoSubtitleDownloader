tt1229238,"00:12:47,814","00:12:50,628","If The Secretary wanted me out of there,"
tt1229238,"00:12:51,406","00:12:54,078",must be pretty bad out here.
tt1229238,"00:12:56,733","00:13:00,126",We were after a file. We lost it.
tt1229238,"00:13:00,208","00:13:02,915","We? Who lost it, you?"
tt1229238,"00:13:08,141","00:13:11,340",- Agent Hanaway. - Where is Hanaway?
tt1229238,"00:13:21,219","00:13:23,332",It was a little drop
tt1229238,"00:13:23,784","00:13:25,597",... classified file.
tt1229238,"00:13:25,902","00:13:28,325",It should've been a simple intercept.
tt1229238,"00:13:36,418","00:13:38,404","They knew, which train the courier was on."
tt1229238,"00:13:38,439","00:13:40,281",ETA 2 minutes on the courier.
tt1229238,"00:13:40,316","00:13:43,267",- But there is one thing we didn't know. - Wild Cat.

tt1229238,"00:13:59,346","00:14:01,139","Now or never, Bob Cap."
tt1229238,"00:14:01,667","00:14:04,233","Hurry! Who's delivering the file, what's his name?"
tt1229238,"00:14:05,028","00:14:08,261","- Go ahead, shoot. - We're out of time."
tt1229238,"00:14:14,394","00:14:18,063","I need a name, folks. You can't track all these people at once."
tt1229238,"00:14:18,983","00:14:22,424","Aargh, Marek..Stefanski. For the love of God.."
tt1229238,"00:14:22,771","00:14:25,457",- You got it? - Marek Stefanski.
tt1229238,"00:14:28,442","00:14:30,594",Searching...
tt1229238,"00:14:42,601","00:14:44,763",I'll take it from here.
tt1229238,"00:14:54,912","00:14:55,945","Are you allright, buddy?"
tt1229238,"00:14:55,980","00:14:58,136","Hanaway dropped Marek, and grab his bag."
tt1229238,"00:14:58,137","00:15:01,884",Sit down. Get your breath.
tt1229238,"00:15:02,235","00:15:06,008",He had the file in his in hands. Easy in easy out.
tt1229238,"00:15:06,043","00:15:08,446",file's secured.
tt1229238,"00:15:08,744","00:15:11,544",But we weren't the only ones after it.
tt1229238,"00:15:11,765","00:15:14,647","Bob Cap, someone else is scratched this party."
tt1229238,"00:15:16,479","00:15:18,923",I'm not alone.
tt1229238,"00:15:18,958","00:15:22,701",- Local police? - No. Armed hostils.
tt1229238,"00:15:29,418","00:15:32,765","Maintain, I'm coming. I will get him backing up."
tt1229238,"00:15:32,957","00:15:36,423","Negative, Operator. Broad the route southwest corner, 60 seconds."
tt1229238,"00:15:38,604","00:15:41,431",Hanaway's lens came to a facial matched... and triggered a warning.
tt1229238,"00:15:39,680","00:15:41,431",...
tt1229238,"00:15:45,096","00:15:47,537",But it was too late.
tt1229238,"00:15:53,447","00:15:55,201",No!
tt1229238,"00:15:59,708","00:16:01,794",You're gonna be okay.
tt1229238,"00:16:04,770","00:16:07,425",You're so beautiful.
tt1229238,"00:16:08,099","00:16:11,830",I should've told you..
tt1229238,"00:16:15,987","00:16:18,224",It was my op.
tt1229238,"00:16:19,156","00:16:21,647",I put him in the field.
tt1229238,"00:16:22,030","00:16:25,754",And she left him just alive enough for me to see him die.
tt1229238,"00:16:42,563","00:16:45,096",I'm sorry.
tt1229238,"00:16:47,136","00:16:51,205",- You know her? - Sabine Moreau. Contract killer.
tt1229238,"00:16:52,164","00:16:54,536",Works for diamonds.
tt1229238,"00:16:55,196","00:16:57,286",Who is in the file?
tt1229238,"00:17:04,780","00:17:07,842",Russian nuclear launch codes.
tt1229238,"00:17:14,489","00:17:18,263","IMF's been looking for emerging extremist, codenamed Cobalt ."
tt1229238,"00:17:18,298","00:17:21,496",He's determined to detonate a nuclear weapon however he can.
tt1229238,"00:17:21,531","00:17:23,666",We know Moreau works for him before.
tt1229238,"00:17:23,882","00:17:26,700",What else did IMF know about him?
tt1229238,"00:17:27,115","00:17:28,709",As much as you do now.
tt1229238,"00:17:28,799","00:17:30,587","But if Moreau has nuclear launch codes,"
tt1229238,"00:17:30,588","00:17:35,661",you can bet Cobalt's confirmed person of interest to enemy number one .
tt1229238,"00:17:35,697","00:17:38,116",We're here.
tt1229238,"00:18:00,348","00:18:04,013",- Agent confirmed. - Why was he in prison?
tt1229238,"00:18:04,942","00:18:08,776",He disobeyed. After he and his wife ... you know.
tt1229238,"00:18:09,683","00:18:13,062",I thought he just been transferred. Or on leave.
tt1229238,"00:18:13,842","00:18:16,064",There were rumours then...
tt1229238,"00:18:16,099","00:18:17,841",to work on the unsanctioned hit.
tt1229238,"00:18:17,876","00:18:19,549","Welcome back, Mr. Hunt."
tt1229238,"00:18:19,584","00:18:22,847","In your absence, IMF has learnt that Cobalt is, or was,"
tt1229238,"00:18:22,882","00:18:26,111",a level one nuclear strategist for Russian Intelligent.
tt1229238,"00:18:26,112","00:18:29,170","Therefore, the only way to uncover his actual identity"
tt1229238,"00:18:29,205","00:18:32,031",is to infiltrate the Kremlin itself.
tt1229238,"00:18:32,176","00:18:33,616","In order to get passed their checkpoints,"
tt1229238,"00:18:33,651","00:18:36,681",you'll be impersonating General Anatoly Fedorov.
tt1229238,"00:18:36,682","00:18:40,560",We believe Cobalt will do everything he can to destroy any record of his identity.
tt1229238,"00:18:40,845","00:18:43,172","Your mission, should you choose to accept it,"
tt1229238,"00:18:43,207","00:18:46,355",is to penetrate the highly secured archive inside the Kremlin.
tt1229238,"00:18:46,390","00:18:48,927","And retrieve Cobalt's file, before he can destroy it."
tt1229238,"00:18:49,272","00:18:52,105","New intel suggests Cobalt is already in route,"
tt1229238,"00:18:52,210","00:18:55,437",leaving you... 4 hours 52 minutes
tt1229238,"00:18:55,692","00:18:56,971",to infiltrate.
tt1229238,"00:18:57,006","00:18:59,696","To save time, we've chosen your team for you."
tt1229238,"00:18:59,881","00:19:02,729",Agent Carter and Dunn.
tt1229238,"00:19:03,993","00:19:08,663","As always, should you or any member of your team, be caught or killed."
tt1229238,"00:19:08,698","00:19:11,448",The Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions.
tt1229238,"00:19:11,483","00:19:15,452","This message will self-destruct in 5 seconds. Good luck, Ethan."
tt1229238,"00:19:39,047","00:19:40,864",What do you got?
tt1229238,"00:19:45,029","00:19:47,799",We're going into the Kremlin.
tt1229238,"00:19:49,458","00:19:52,326","I thought you said ""the Kremlin""."
tt1229238,"00:19:52,902","00:19:56,029","I thought you said ""the Kremlin""."
tt1229238,"00:19:57,660","00:19:59,711",Okay.
tt1229238,"00:20:36,011","00:20:38,183",This is very exciting.
tt1229238,"00:20:39,581","00:20:42,789","Being on the field ... with you, you know."
tt1229238,"00:20:43,439","00:20:46,027",It's a bit of a dream ... for me.
tt1229238,"00:20:47,605","00:20:50,696",I love your disguise by the way. You look just like him.
tt1229238,"00:20:52,014","00:20:55,792",It's a shame would wear a masks. You know like a full masks.
tt1229238,"00:20:56,637","00:20:59,323","Everybody get to wear a mask, but Benji."
tt1229238,"00:21:00,344","00:21:03,269",Sorry. I'm dead. I babbled when I am nervous.
tt1229238,"00:21:03,304","00:21:05,822","When doing it again, shut up it."
tt1229238,"00:21:19,254","00:21:22,005","Okay, settle secure to go, that's x-ray machines, cameras..."
tt1229238,"00:21:22,040","00:21:24,756",metal detectors. Just what we expected.
tt1229238,"00:21:24,868","00:21:26,532",We can do this.

tt1229238,"00:46:52,929","00:46:56,494","Agent. Dunn and Carter. William Brandt, chief analyst."
tt1229238,"00:46:56,529","00:46:58,564",Analyst.
tt1229238,"00:47:02,215","00:47:04,919",Agent confirmed.
tt1229238,"00:47:11,568","00:47:14,054",Power of the world finally end.
tt1229238,"00:47:15,752","00:47:18,469",It is my job to predict the unthinkable.
tt1229238,"00:47:20,180","00:47:23,615",To treat the death of billions as a game.
tt1229238,"00:47:24,370","00:47:28,066","After 20 years of this, I was none."
tt1229238,"00:47:28,665","00:47:31,935",Until a new question crossed my mind.
tt1229238,"00:47:32,567","00:47:35,529",What happens after the end of the world?
tt1229238,"00:47:35,564","00:47:37,320",Are you sure your line is secure?
tt1229238,"00:47:37,563","00:47:39,506",Every 2 or 3 million years ...
tt1229238,"00:47:39,541","00:47:42,194",Are you certain your line is secure?
tt1229238,"00:47:42,229","00:47:46,396",... some natural catastrophy devastates all life on earth.
tt1229238,"00:47:46,669","00:47:48,601",But life goes on.
tt1229238,"00:47:48,877","00:47:52,260",And what little remain is made stronger.
tt1229238,"00:47:52,594","00:47:56,168","Put simply world destruction, isn't unpleasant.."
tt1229238,"00:47:56,203","00:47:59,268",..but necessary part of evolution.
tt1229238,"00:48:01,597","00:48:03,572","What happens then, I wondered."
tt1229238,"00:48:03,712","00:48:06,578",When mankind faces the next end of the world.
tt1229238,"00:48:06,613","00:48:09,299","I don't care what you have to do, to get him to Dubai."
tt1229238,"00:48:09,334","00:48:11,986",I'll make you worse as well. Just do it.
tt1229238,"00:48:12,079","00:48:15,837","- I look to Hiroshima, Nagasaki. - Well, I'll be waiting for your call."
tt1229238,"00:48:15,872","00:48:18,626","Thriving cities, rebuilt from the ashes."
tt1229238,"00:48:18,661","00:48:20,854",Monuments to unimaginable
tt1229238,"00:48:20,889","00:48:23,642",dedicated to the concept of peace.
tt1229238,"00:48:23,643","00:48:26,544","It's occured to me here, that nuclear war.."
tt1229238,"00:48:26,579","00:48:29,315",might have a place in the natural order.
tt1229238,"00:48:29,688","00:48:32,158",But only if it could be controlled.
tt1229238,"00:48:32,244","00:48:36,681",Only if attached every living song equally.
tt1229238,"00:48:37,994","00:48:42,402","IMF and I believe this man, Kurt Hendricks, is a nuclear extremist."
tt1229238,"00:48:42,437","00:48:44,279","Codename, Cobalt."
tt1229238,"00:48:44,314","00:48:46,737","Today he was seen leaving the Kremlin, that would most likely"
tt1229238,"00:48:46,738","00:48:47,738",a nuclear launch device.
tt1229238,"00:48:51,159","00:48:54,106","A few days ago, Sabine Moreau killed one of our agents in Budapest."
tt1229238,"00:48:54,141","00:48:56,745",We believe him off Russian nuclear launch code.
tt1229238,"00:48:56,935","00:49:01,341",Intel indicates she would check in the Burj Hotel in Dubai in 36 hours.
tt1229238,"00:49:02,574","00:49:05,087",Mariusz Wistrom is known operative of Cobalt.
tt1229238,"00:49:05,404","00:49:07,690",Wistrom is currently on route to Dubai.
tt1229238,"00:49:07,725","00:49:11,384","For the launch device to work, Cobalt needs the activation codes."
tt1229238,"00:49:11,419","00:49:14,627","He's sending Wistrom, to buy them from Moreau."
tt1229238,"00:49:15,416","00:49:19,395",The Secretary is dead.
tt1229238,"00:49:24,707","00:49:27,627",The President has invoked Ghost Protocol.
tt1229238,"00:49:28,329","00:49:30,006",We're shut down.
tt1229238,"00:49:30,041","00:49:33,942","No satellites, safehouse, support or extraction."
tt1229238,"00:49:33,943","00:49:35,460",The four of us ...
tt1229238,"00:49:35,712","00:49:40,295",... and the content of this car are all that remain of the IMF.
tt1229238,"00:49:40,330","00:49:42,303",And as if this moment any actions are unsanctioned.
tt1229238,"00:49:42,338","00:49:46,225","So if you want out, speak now."
tt1229238,"00:50:02,390","00:50:03,919",Our mission is Hendricks.
tt1229238,"00:50:03,954","00:50:07,335","We're all  distance between him and his goal, nothing can be left to chance."
tt1229238,"00:50:07,370","00:50:10,716",Everyone connected with this man is considered an asset
tt1229238,"00:50:10,751","00:50:12,447",with valuable information about our target.
tt1229238,"00:50:12,482","00:50:14,108",No one can know we're still online.
tt1229238,"00:50:14,143","00:50:16,664","We lose Hendricks now, we lose him forever."
tt1229238,"00:50:16,699","00:50:18,188","So, what's the plan?"
tt1229238,"00:50:18,223","00:50:20,816",Wistrom  will take delivery from Moreau in 36 hours.
tt1229238,"00:50:20,851","00:50:23,136",Now we can not let the launch codes leave the hotel.
tt1229238,"00:50:23,171","00:50:26,255",But we need Wistrom to lead us to Hendricks.
tt1229238,"00:50:26,290","00:50:28,590","Yeah, we only do that if he has the codes"
tt1229238,"00:50:28,625","00:50:30,891",- Or if he thinks he has it. - Objective. ..
tt1229238,"00:50:30,926","00:50:32,575",... is to intercept the sale.
tt1229238,"00:50:32,704","00:50:34,453",Place the authentic codes with counterfeits.
tt1229238,"00:50:34,488","00:50:37,704","- and follow Wistrom to Hendricks. - Well, that's, that's simple enough."
tt1229238,"00:50:37,739","00:50:39,941","We just, we snatch the codes, we generate some fakes."
tt1229238,"00:50:40,055","00:50:43,391","Jane, you double Moreau and sell the codes to Wistrom."
tt1229238,"00:50:43,426","00:50:44,600",And bob your ankle.
tt1229238,"00:50:44,635","00:50:48,450","And how do you propose, that we just snatch the code from Moreau?"
tt1229238,"00:50:48,554","00:50:50,473",You take her out.
tt1229238,"00:50:51,641","00:50:54,674","Yeah, we take her out,but you know, discreetly."
tt1229238,"00:50:54,883","00:50:57,182",- Discreetly? - Yeah.
tt1229238,"00:50:58,346","00:51:00,224","- Right, she's an asset. - Right."
tt1229238,"00:51:00,259","00:51:02,068","I get it. Sorry. Nothing left to chance, he said."
tt1229238,"00:51:02,103","00:51:04,481","I'm just, I'm a spit bowling. You know, it's not all gonna be go."
tt1229238,"00:51:04,482","00:51:07,893",- We don't touch Wistrom.. . - All right. -..or Moreau.
tt1229238,"00:51:09,726","00:51:12,723","As you asked for Hanaway, but it has to be when I say."
tt1229238,"00:51:12,758","00:51:15,365",After we had Hendricks.
tt1229238,"00:51:20,307","00:51:22,258",- Only pack what we need. - Yeah absolutely.
tt1229238,"00:51:22,293","00:51:24,210",Only pack what we need. You never know.
tt1229238,"00:51:34,130","00:51:38,222",DUBAI
tt1229238,"00:51:52,035","00:51:55,152","So even if we can double Wistrom and Moreau,"
tt1229238,"00:51:55,187","00:51:57,649","How do we keep them in separate rooms,"
tt1229238,"00:51:57,684","00:52:00,112",Or having they think they are in the same room?
tt1229238,"00:52:00,378","00:52:02,372",We give the hotel a facelift.
tt1229238,"00:52:02,407","00:52:05,077",Wistrom will think he's arriving at Moreau's suite.
tt1229238,"00:52:05,428","00:52:07,782","But really, he will be walking into our decoy room."
tt1229238,"00:52:07,817","00:52:09,391",Where I'll double Moreau.
tt1229238,"00:52:09,426","00:52:11,393",Downstairs Benji will double Wistrom...
tt1229238,"00:52:11,428","00:52:13,883",- a masks! - And meet with real Moreau.
tt1229238,"00:52:13,959","00:52:17,476","And eh, huh, What am I doing?"
tt1229238,"00:52:18,010","00:52:20,745",You? You're the helper.
tt1229238,"00:52:23,468","00:52:25,989",Help ... okay.
tt1229238,"00:52:26,104","00:52:29,498","So, to the extent understand what are you talking about here  ..."
tt1229238,"00:52:30,622","00:52:33,065","uhm, Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world."
tt1229238,"00:52:33,348","00:52:35,488","And you want to alter its infrastructure,"
tt1229238,"00:52:35,523","00:52:37,556",with the hopes of convincing two people that
tt1229238,"00:52:38,362","00:52:41,591","they had a meeting, which actually really never happened ..."
tt1229238,"00:52:42,644","00:52:44,685",Right?
tt1229238,"00:52:52,072","00:52:54,226",Camels.
tt1229238,"00:53:40,397","00:53:42,710",ETA on dry cleaning.
tt1229238,"00:53:42,968","00:53:45,061",I'm on my way out.
tt1229238,"00:53:47,630","00:53:49,928","Okay, 34 minutes to doorknock."
tt1229238,"00:53:56,501","00:54:00,732","wow,.. ehm, okay. this, this is a slight wrinkle,.. nothing, nothing to worry about."
tt1229238,"00:54:00,767","00:54:04,478","We're just gonna have to go into server room, from the outside."
tt1229238,"00:54:05,797","00:54:10,473","- What? - Well, the firewalls in this building serve a  military grade."
tt1229238,"00:54:10,508","00:54:13,467","I mean, this would be a synched if I could call Yusuf back at headquarter,"
tt1229238,"00:54:13,502","00:54:15,882","but Yusuf doen't exist anymore, and neither do we."
tt1229238,"00:54:15,917","00:54:17,488","I could hack it, but it would take too long."
tt1229238,"00:54:17,523","00:54:18,636",Their hardware in.
tt1229238,"00:54:18,637","00:54:21,383",And there's four layers of an exchange security because not in server-in.
tt1229238,"00:54:21,418","00:54:23,871",and there is no way we can get into it from inside.
tt1229238,"00:54:24,193","00:54:28,770","If we can't get through the server, we don't control the elevators, we don't control security cameras."
tt1229238,"00:54:28,961","00:54:30,977",This operation is over even before it begins.
tt1229238,"00:54:31,012","00:54:32,994",I'm telling you we can get to it from outside.
tt1229238,"00:54:33,029","00:54:34,865",We?
tt1229238,"00:54:35,051","00:54:37,589","I'm,  I'm on the computer."
tt1229238,"00:54:38,497","00:54:42,328",I'm just a ... the helper.
tt1229238,"00:54:45,364","00:54:48,218",- What floor is it now? - 130.
tt1229238,"00:54:48,783","00:54:51,525",130 ?
tt1229238,"00:54:54,343","00:54:55,632",- Vent out? - pressure's unstiff.
tt1229238,"00:54:55,633","00:54:56,633",don't have enough time.
tt1229238,"00:54:56,790","00:54:58,008",- Elevator shaft. - infrared sensors.
tt1229238,"00:54:58,009","00:54:59,009",don't have enough time.
tt1229238,"00:55:02,924","00:55:05,610",How am I suppose to do this?
tt1229238,"00:55:11,017","00:55:12,967",Dammit!
tt1229238,"00:55:15,606","00:55:17,907","Oh, that's high."
tt1229238,"00:55:22,686","00:55:26,607","Okay, now remember, it's a rolling off motion, that disengages the bond."
tt1229238,"00:55:26,880","00:55:28,840","When the emitter is blue, that's full adhesion."
tt1229238,"00:55:28,940","00:55:30,880","Easy way to remember. ""Blue is glue."""
tt1229238,"00:55:30,915","00:55:32,821",- And when it's red? - Dead.
tt1229238,"00:55:32,921","00:55:35,555","ah, here's your cutter, okay? And your server interface."
tt1229238,"00:55:35,590","00:55:36,711",Both going back here.
tt1229238,"00:55:36,746","00:55:38,391","One, two."
tt1229238,"00:55:38,426","00:55:41,091","Okay Ethan, holds-all service, 11 stories up"
tt1229238,"00:55:41,092","00:55:42,327",and 7 units over.
tt1229238,"00:55:42,841","00:55:43,762",Okay?
tt1229238,"00:55:44,075","00:55:47,011","- Com check? - Yeah, copy."
tt1229238,"00:55:48,859","00:55:50,616",So ...
tt1229238,"00:55:54,240","00:55:57,007",It's 26 minutes to doorknock.
tt1229238,"00:56:12,700","00:56:13,700",Yeah ...
tt1229238,"00:56:53,771","00:56:56,082",25 minutes to doorknock.
tt1229238,"00:57:11,062","00:57:13,055",What the hell is that?
tt1229238,"00:57:27,498","00:57:30,263","Hell, what the hell is that?"
tt1229238,"00:57:31,456","00:57:33,805",It's a sandstorm.
tt1229238,"00:57:35,331","00:57:37,925","It's a long way off, Ethan. There's shouldn't be a problem."
tt1229238,"00:57:40,847","00:57:43,335",24 minutes to doorknock.
tt1229238,"00:57:46,481","00:57:48,450",Where is Ethan?
tt1229238,"00:57:50,459","00:57:52,748",You gotta be kidding me.
tt1229238,"00:58:41,696","00:58:44,534",23 minutes to doorknock.
tt1229238,"00:59:03,051","00:59:05,169",I'm in the server level.
tt1229238,"00:59:27,505","00:59:30,093",23 minutes to doorknock.
tt1229238,"00:59:30,266","00:59:33,163",Your countdown is not helping.
tt1229238,"00:59:34,770","00:59:36,676",I'm just saying.
tt1229238,"01:00:06,138","01:00:08,918","- I'm in. - That's great, Ethan. You're half way home."
tt1229238,"01:00:16,491","01:00:18,655",Located server.
tt1229238,"01:00:24,626","01:00:26,361",Please tell me we're online.
tt1229238,"01:00:26,468","01:00:28,415","All right, we're live."
tt1229238,"01:00:28,450","01:00:30,362","Okay, now I have control of the elevators."
tt1229238,"01:00:30,462","01:00:33,056",- And the security cameras. - Time to evacuate.
tt1229238,"01:00:33,091","01:00:35,918","Okay. You drive, and look out for Wistrom and Moreau."
tt1229238,"01:00:50,981","01:00:54,063",Moreau is at the elevator. It has resceduled.
tt1229238,"01:00:54,266","01:00:55,749",Go.
tt1229238,"01:01:00,972","01:01:04,201","- We can't open this door, can  we? - That door? No."
tt1229238,"01:01:04,236","01:01:06,743",Ethan you gotta get down here now.
tt1229238,"01:01:07,262","01:01:10,346",Ethan. Ethan. Is there a problem?
tt1229238,"01:01:11,061","01:01:12,667",Ethan?
tt1229238,"01:01:18,952","01:01:21,650",- We're not gonna make it. - We have to make it.
tt1229238,"01:01:22,529","01:01:24,320",Where is Ethan?
tt1229238,"01:01:45,040","01:01:49,534","- Your line is not long enough! - No, shit!"
tt1229238,"01:02:36,430","01:02:39,812","That was not easy, but I, I did it."
tt1229238,"01:02:42,820","01:02:44,689",What I missed?

tt1229238,"01:02:54,101","01:02:57,609",It captures images and transmits them to the printer in the briefcase.
tt1229238,"01:02:58,007","01:02:59,887",- All right? - hmm...
tt1229238,"01:03:00,085","01:03:02,273","I can't see, one eye right of it, fine."
tt1229238,"01:03:02,308","01:03:04,461",Blinks twice to activate the shutter.
tt1229238,"01:03:05,410","01:03:08,357","Notice, the numbers are in order."
tt1229238,"01:03:11,068","01:03:13,504",A perfect copy.
tt1229238,"01:03:13,937","01:03:16,501",But the numbers are scrambled.
tt1229238,"01:03:17,294","01:03:20,489","Masks? ah, 60 seconds. Are you sure that I shouldn't wear a mask?"
tt1229238,"01:03:20,524","01:03:22,767","You know, cause I'm not exactly Omar Sharif."
tt1229238,"01:03:22,767","01:03:25,135",I'll play a french. This is you tracking device.
tt1229238,"01:03:25,135","01:03:26,990",- This is what you're tracking. - paper clip?
tt1229238,"01:03:26,990","01:03:28,697","No, it's a paper. It's in the briefcase."
tt1229238,"01:03:28,697","01:03:30,781","It's caught to be isotops, which should give a unique  ..."
tt1229238,"01:03:30,781","01:03:33,157","- It just means that you can track documents, even if they switch briefcases. - Range?"
tt1229238,"01:03:33,157","01:03:35,596","- Not that good, like a half a mile (800 meters)."
tt1229238,"01:03:35,596","01:03:37,884",Safest thing to do not let Wistrom out of your sight.
tt1229238,"01:03:37,885","01:03:39,534",Is that Wistrom?
tt1229238,"01:03:43,981","01:03:44,980",Who's out with him?
tt1229238,"01:03:44,980","01:03:47,391","- I don't know. - We don't have an uplink, so there's no facial recognition."
tt1229238,"01:03:47,391","01:03:49,843",Who's out with him?
tt1229238,"01:03:50,228","01:03:52,838",That's Leonid Lisenker. Polish phone cryptographer.
tt1229238,"01:03:52,838","01:03:56,097",He redesigned Russia's nuclear security at the Cold War.
tt1229238,"01:03:56,098","01:03:58,376",He set off to authenticate the launch codes.
tt1229238,"01:03:58,376","01:04:00,105","- yeah shit, we are blown. - No, no, no."
tt1229238,"01:04:00,105","01:04:02,941","Well, we'll would be as soon as he sees the counterfeit launch codes."
tt1229238,"01:04:02,941","01:04:05,290",- We're not alone. - He's in the elevator.
tt1229238,"01:04:05,290","01:04:07,467",Delay it.
tt1229238,"01:04:15,767","01:04:17,975","Benji, how long would take it reprogram the case?"
tt1229238,"01:04:17,975","01:04:19,950","Ah, a couple seconds. Wow, What for that?"
tt1229238,"01:04:19,950","01:04:22,969",- To make an exact copy of the launch codes. - What?!
tt1229238,"01:04:22,969","01:04:25,060",- You can't do that. - Wistrom's on 22.
tt1229238,"01:04:25,060","01:04:27,427",- Slow him down. - I do what I can.
tt1229238,"01:04:29,365","01:04:32,534","wait, wait, Ethan! Hey! Hang on now, hang on, just a second!"
tt1229238,"01:04:32,534","01:04:36,033","You, you're talking about handing over active nuclear launch code to Wistrom?"
tt1229238,"01:04:36,033","01:04:38,772","- the case, reprogram the case. - Listen, listen, stop! Listen, listen."
tt1229238,"01:04:38,966","01:04:41,512","You're saying you're fixating, you're thinking clearly."
tt1229238,"01:04:41,512","01:04:43,333","Listen, that's not gonna happened!"
tt1229238,"01:04:43,560","01:04:45,691","- I won't allow it. - 33, and climbing."
tt1229238,"01:04:45,691","01:04:49,066","Brandt, use your head. The mission is not the code, the mission is Hendricks."
tt1229238,"01:04:49,066","01:04:51,273","And this little play out, give him back codes neutralize it."
tt1229238,"01:04:51,273","01:04:53,269",You know that won't do it. Failure to a terrorist...
tt1229238,"01:04:53,269","01:04:55,260",...just a rehearsal for success.
tt1229238,"01:04:55,260","01:04:56,529",41!
tt1229238,"01:04:56,529","01:04:58,928","We lose Hendricks today, he shows up somewhere else tomorrow."
tt1229238,"01:04:58,928","01:05:01,632",He finds another way. With no IMF to stop him.
tt1229238,"01:05:01,632","01:05:03,950","Now, it's now or never. Now hand me the case."
tt1229238,"01:05:03,950","01:05:06,115",Nothing left to chance. You said that !
tt1229238,"01:05:06,115","01:05:07,800",You're the analyst. Now tell me..
tt1229238,"01:05:07,801","01:05:09,419",..there's another way for Hendricks to get those codes. - 50!
tt1229238,"01:05:10,425","01:05:13,226","You tell me that this is only happened right here, right now. Today!"
tt1229238,"01:05:13,226","01:05:15,073","You tell me that, I'll walk away."
tt1229238,"01:05:23,197","01:05:24,953",- We go without! - Without masks?
tt1229238,"01:05:24,954","01:05:26,500",- Changes to go. - Ethan!
tt1229238,"01:05:26,501","01:05:29,263","- We have no choice. - Ethan, you will be walking on Moreau unarmed."
tt1229238,"01:05:29,263","01:05:31,986",- Face first. Literally. - How do we know they've met?
tt1229238,"01:05:31,987","01:05:33,862",- How do we know they haven't? - It doesn't matter!
tt1229238,"01:05:34,960","01:05:37,848",Damn! We have no choice.
tt1229238,"01:06:29,374","01:06:30,822",Goggles.

tt1229238,"01:13:34,636","01:13:36,504",I'll handle it.

tt1229238,"01:14:57,066","01:14:58,996",You and I are not enemies. It was a setup.
tt1229238,"01:14:58,996","01:15:03,029",We'll find out your lies soon enough. Move it!
tt1229238,"01:15:04,716","01:15:07,425",I'm sorry about this.

tt1229238,"01:22:13,675","01:22:15,218","Now what happened with Moreau, Jane?"
tt1229238,"01:22:15,218","01:22:18,014","- She couldn't help us with... - Yeah, so let's throw her off the building?"
tt1229238,"01:22:18,114","01:22:20,161",- I didn't throw her! - That's throw her off the building!
tt1229238,"01:22:20,161","01:22:22,687","She was not the mission, Jane."
tt1229238,"01:22:22,687","01:22:26,313",The mission was to track the file back to Hendricks.
tt1229238,"01:22:26,680","01:22:29,586",Whose in the wind ...
tt1229238,"01:22:50,686","01:22:53,866",Better have good news for me. Is he here?
tt1229238,"01:22:55,694","01:22:58,816",I got it. Talk to you later. I'll be there.
tt1229238,"01:22:58,816","01:23:02,094",But no one will be following me. Just make sure no one's following you.
tt1229238,"01:23:02,194","01:23:04,852",- And how the hell that the Russians find us? - Why do you ask me for?
tt1229238,"01:23:05,009","01:23:07,610",Because you are in communication. You in charge covering our tracks.
tt1229238,"01:23:07,611","01:23:10,647","We can not afford to make mistakes like that now, Benji."
tt1229238,"01:23:10,647","01:23:13,038",You are  not a technician anymore. You're field agent.
tt1229238,"01:23:13,038","01:23:15,127",And you're just an analyst?!
tt1229238,"01:23:16,014","01:23:18,526",Right? Right?
tt1229238,"01:23:20,144","01:23:23,127","Who are you really, Brandt?"
tt1229238,"01:23:23,649","01:23:25,520",- What do you ask me? - What am I asking?
tt1229238,"01:23:25,520","01:23:27,413",Let me see if I can put in another ...
tt1229238,"01:23:34,857","01:23:39,179","How does an agent whose skills like that, end up an analyst?"
tt1229238,"01:23:46,896","01:23:49,541",What if we all have secrets?
tt1229238,"01:23:50,539","01:23:53,223","tell me, Ethan."
tt1229238,"01:23:57,018","01:23:59,983","You tell me yours, I tell you mine."
tt1229238,"01:24:12,374","01:24:14,519",I'm all clear.
tt1229238,"01:24:19,350","01:24:22,980",I have friends in the region. Just sit tight. I'll send someone to get you out of here.
tt1229238,"01:24:23,192","01:24:25,155",What about Hendricks? What's the plan?
tt1229238,"01:24:25,156","01:24:28,077",The plan was first to stop him together.
tt1229238,"01:24:28,116","01:24:31,402",- And what would you gonna do? - Change the plan.
tt1229238,"01:24:31,402","01:24:33,510","Wait, that's it?"
tt1229238,"01:24:33,659","01:24:35,996",What we gonna do? go after him alone?
tt1229238,"01:24:37,907","01:24:40,540","You can explain yourself, agent Brandt?"
tt1229238,"01:25:44,687","01:25:47,513",I was in a protection detail in Croatia.
tt1229238,"01:25:47,816","01:25:51,101","Shadowing the assets, husband and wife."
tt1229238,"01:25:52,151","01:25:56,035",We were never suppose to know we were there. Whole things routines as in no crap.
tt1229238,"01:25:59,275","01:26:05,521","Three years in,we caught wind that this Serbian hit squad was after our couple."
tt1229238,"01:26:05,757","01:26:09,654","But my team had it under control, I knew that they would coming."
tt1229238,"01:26:10,980","01:26:15,315",But I couldn't shake this feeling that I should warn the couple somehow.
tt1229238,"01:26:15,315","01:26:18,383",I wanted to..  find the way to let them know
tt1229238,"01:26:20,007","01:26:23,133","But you know, orders are oders, so I didn't."
tt1229238,"01:26:27,836","01:26:32,210","One day, the husband decides to leave the hotel and go for a run."
tt1229238,"01:26:32,210","01:26:33,798",So I followed him.
tt1229238,"01:26:34,374","01:26:37,113",And leave two men with the wife.
tt1229238,"01:26:37,921","01:26:40,058","When I get back,"
tt1229238,"01:26:40,058","01:26:42,951",my guys were unconscious and the wife is gone.
tt1229238,"01:26:43,875","01:26:46,765",Local police found her body three days later.
tt1229238,"01:26:47,881","01:26:50,553",What was left over anyway.
tt1229238,"01:26:55,502","01:26:58,215",It was my last day on the field.
tt1229238,"01:26:59,112","01:27:02,461",I couldn't face another life or death situations after that.
tt1229238,"01:27:02,461","01:27:04,281","So, what happened with her husband?"
tt1229238,"01:27:04,495","01:27:07,240",Never saw him again.
tt1229238,"01:27:07,819","01:27:12,653","Until two days ago, in Moscow, when the Secretary introduced me to Ethan Hunt."
tt1229238,"01:27:16,285","01:27:19,628","No, that's not what happened. She left him, you know."
tt1229238,"01:27:19,622","01:27:22,597","I heard that one too, Benji."
tt1229238,"01:27:22,853","01:27:26,481","But, unfortunately, I was there."
tt1229238,"01:27:27,227","01:27:30,953",Just like I was there when the Secretary got the phone call..
tt1229238,"01:27:30,954","01:27:35,491",..that Ethan was in custody for killing 6 Serbian nationals  in cold blood.
tt1229238,"01:27:35,609","01:27:37,690","- ah, I'm sorry, shouldn't hit? - Yeah."
tt1229238,"01:27:37,734","01:27:40,769",Disavowed.
tt1229238,"01:27:48,153","01:27:52,629",Last thing I know ... I am on the plane to Dubai.
tt1229238,"01:27:53,977","01:27:57,776",Wondering the old time ... Do I tell him?
tt1229238,"01:27:59,766","01:28:02,512",How do I tell him?
tt1229238,"01:28:03,457","01:28:06,185",That I'm responsible.
tt1229238,"01:28:07,926","01:28:11,093",I could've warned him. I should've warned him.
tt1229238,"01:28:13,652","01:28:15,915",But I didn't.
tt1229238,"01:28:16,956","01:28:19,210",And she died.
tt1229238,"01:28:24,846","01:28:28,435","Sergei! Sergei, my friend!"
tt1229238,"01:28:28,435","01:28:31,498","I told you, I was gathered here. Didn't I say?"
tt1229238,"01:28:31,498","01:28:33,669","- I don't know it's him? - Yes, it's him."
tt1229238,"01:28:33,791","01:28:36,004","You trust me, I trust you, right?"
tt1229238,"01:28:36,728","01:28:41,024","This is the guy! This is the guy, the one I told you about."
tt1229238,"01:28:41,120","01:28:43,988","So, we can take these things off."
tt1229238,"01:28:48,455","01:28:51,637","Sorry, he's a great guy, but he doesn't know you like I do, you understand."
tt1229238,"01:28:51,637","01:28:54,611","So, you work for American government?"
tt1229238,"01:28:55,835","01:28:59,737","- And you are an arm stealer. - No, no! Sergei, Sergei!"
tt1229238,"01:29:00,423","01:29:04,517","He's independent defense coordinator, right?"
tt1229238,"01:29:05,589","01:29:07,591","That's right, very classic job."
tt1229238,"01:29:07,591","01:29:10,337","- Listen, he's a friend. - Those diamonds are for Bogdan."
tt1229238,"01:29:10,338","01:29:12,278","No, no, it's okay. He can have it."
tt1229238,"01:29:12,593","01:29:16,049","Whatever arrangements you made with my cousin, it's between you and him."
tt1229238,"01:29:16,140","01:29:18,795","You want something from me, you pay."
tt1229238,"01:29:18,795","01:29:21,700",You misunderstand. I am not buying.
tt1229238,"01:29:21,794","01:29:23,606",I'm selling.
tt1229238,"01:29:23,743","01:29:25,830",You selling?
tt1229238,"01:29:26,009","01:29:28,873",- Selling what? - The future.
tt1229238,"01:29:29,523","01:29:31,513","Yeah, I got all I need, thank you."
tt1229238,"01:29:31,513","01:29:34,033",Our countries are on the break of war.
tt1229238,"01:29:34,033","01:29:36,322",War is very good for business.
tt1229238,"01:29:36,322","01:29:39,022",Nuclear war?
tt1229238,"01:29:48,207","01:29:49,415",Go on.
tt1229238,"01:29:49,415","01:29:52,571",I'm looking for a man named Kurt Hendricks. You may know him as Cobalt.
tt1229238,"01:29:52,671","01:29:55,538","In this case, I think you know what he wants."
tt1229238,"01:29:55,720","01:29:58,764",I bet he even try to buy it from you at some point.
tt1229238,"01:29:59,819","01:30:03,277","- Go on. - He has a case, he has codes."
tt1229238,"01:30:03,608","01:30:06,656",But they're worthless without tactical satellite.
tt1229238,"01:30:07,186","01:30:10,080",I want to know where he get it.
tt1229238,"01:30:10,080","01:30:13,990",A man with information like that would be a potential terrorist.
tt1229238,"01:30:14,565","01:30:21,106","And to your government, a potential terrorist is a terrorist."
tt1229238,"01:30:23,499","01:30:26,019",Do you help me?
tt1229238,"01:30:26,019","01:30:30,004",My friends become your friends.
tt1229238,"01:30:32,082","01:30:35,949",Sorry. I can not help you.
tt1229238,"01:30:41,585","01:30:46,164","I certainly can not tell you that, Russia quitely sold an obselete technical satellite..."
tt1229238,"01:30:46,164","01:30:49,656",to a certain telecom in Mumbai.
tt1229238,"01:30:50,387","01:30:53,500",And who ever gave them that idea?
tt1229238,"01:30:54,109","01:30:56,559",An enterprising third party.
tt1229238,"01:30:56,559","01:30:58,040",Working on commission.
tt1229238,"01:30:58,040","01:31:01,793","Helping old friends, making new ones."
tt1229238,"01:31:01,793","01:31:05,399",- Can the satellite be shut down? - That would take a special skills then.
tt1229238,"01:31:06,319","01:31:08,642",You can not do it alone.
tt1229238,"01:31:33,915","01:31:36,727",- What's in the bags? - It's our gear.
tt1229238,"01:31:37,098","01:31:40,533",- How'd you get it? - Made a friend.
tt1229238,"01:31:41,339","01:31:44,083",- I'm glad we could help. - You can help now.
tt1229238,"01:31:44,986","01:31:47,600","- Look Ethan, before... - Whatever happened, happened."
tt1229238,"01:31:47,601","01:31:53,083","We still have a chance to clean this up. But we have to do it now, we have to do it together."
tt1229238,"01:31:59,913","01:32:02,403","Yeah sure, where are we going?"
tt1229238,"01:32:03,215","01:32:05,363",India.
tt1229238,"01:32:08,793","01:32:11,442","- India? India? - Yeah, sure. - Okay."
tt1229238,"01:32:15,176","01:32:17,180",Love the jet!
tt1229238,"01:32:17,180","01:32:19,602",Where do you see the car?
tt1229238,"01:32:25,846","01:32:28,445","- Sidorov. - (in Russian) What are you doing, man?"
tt1229238,"01:32:28,445","01:32:30,392",You were ...
tt1229238,"01:32:30,858","01:32:34,033",I was worried for nothing.
tt1229238,"01:32:38,655","01:32:42,803",- I heard that you're looking for an American.. - Continue.
tt1229238,"01:32:43,600","01:32:49,513",And launching devices were stolen yesterday.
tt1229238,"01:32:50,234","01:32:54,599",- Seriously? - I can help you find them.
tt1229238,"01:32:54,599","01:32:57,890",If you agree with that.
tt1229238,"01:33:03,620","01:33:04,740",Brij Nath.
tt1229238,"01:33:04,740","01:33:07,161",Brij Nath. Playboy. Multimedia tycoon.
tt1229238,"01:33:07,566","01:33:10,700","On the surface, this turn network as state of the art"
tt1229238,"01:33:10,814","01:33:14,150",but its  build time illegally acquired Cold War cast off
tt1229238,"01:33:14,150","01:33:16,095","including this,the Novosti satellite."
tt1229238,"01:33:16,289","01:33:18,087","Hendricks needs it to launch a nuclear strike,"
tt1229238,"01:33:18,087","01:33:21,020","and we have to shut it down, before he gets that chance."
tt1229238,"01:33:21,020","01:33:23,807","And to do that we need to get the acess codes from him,"
tt1229238,"01:33:23,807","01:33:25,838",one way or another.
tt1229238,"01:33:26,112","01:33:28,398",And if I don't ...
tt1229238,"01:33:28,624","01:33:31,381",None of this works.
tt1229238,"01:33:31,381","01:33:34,122",- You can do this. - Yeah.
tt1229238,"01:33:34,528","01:33:37,305",A week ago I would've believed you.
tt1229238,"01:33:42,538","01:33:45,412",I don't blame you for what happened.
tt1229238,"01:33:49,807","01:33:52,975",She took someone you cared about. That just not something ...
tt1229238,"01:33:54,097","01:33:55,920","...you just, let go."
tt1229238,"01:33:56,559","01:34:00,163",Did that make you feel better?
tt1229238,"01:34:01,061","01:34:04,045",When you kill the man who killed your wife?
tt1229238,"01:34:12,042","01:34:14,684",We can't get them back.
tt1229238,"01:34:20,328","01:34:24,354","Okay, to shut down the satellite we have to manually tap into the central server."
tt1229238,"01:34:24,521","01:34:28,150",And you'll enter through the exhaust vent wearing this under your suit.
tt1229238,"01:34:28,150","01:34:30,346",I'll drop down into the computer ray
tt1229238,"01:34:30,346","01:34:32,727","and I'll catch you, and we have you along the relay room"
tt1229238,"01:34:32,727","01:34:34,911",and you jack into the panel.
tt1229238,"01:34:38,119","01:34:40,805","Okay, so we enter the party separately as guests"
tt1229238,"01:34:40,805","01:34:43,537","Ethan quarterbacks, while Jane gets the codes ..."
tt1229238,"01:34:43,538","01:34:46,398","from billionaire, I switch off the vent, you jump into the computer,"
tt1229238,"01:34:46,398","01:34:48,422","and I'll catch you, you plug in the transmitter,"
tt1229238,"01:34:48,422","01:34:52,081","Ethan feeds me the codes, which I then use to pinpoit Hendricks' location."
tt1229238,"01:34:52,081","01:34:55,470","okay, you breach over something,"
tt1229238,"01:34:55,470","01:35:00,387","I think it really important to computer array, part,.. or I just,.. jump?"
tt1229238,"01:35:01,015","01:35:02,870",- And I catch you. - Yeah.

tt1229238,"01:35:16,630","01:35:20,276",Science is sign. I'd be more worried about the heat.
tt1229238,"01:35:21,454","01:35:23,692",And then there is that... What heat?
tt1229238,"01:35:24,260","01:35:26,850","Well it's like any computer, isn't it? If you switch off the fan,"
tt1229238,"01:35:27,030","01:35:29,040",it's gonna get really hot.
tt1229238,"01:35:29,040","01:35:31,160","- Of course. - Relatively, you know."
tt1229238,"01:35:32,978","01:35:36,637",Of course it will. So I'm jumping into a ...

tt1229238,"01:48:47,596","01:48:50,648",An apparent retaliation for the Kremlin.
tt1229238,"01:48:50,887","01:48:52,838",That should start the ball running.
tt1229238,"01:48:52,951","01:48:54,451","I am here, Ethan."
tt1229238,"01:48:54,452","01:48:56,972",How long it till Hendricks can launch the missile?
tt1229238,"01:48:56,973","01:48:58,903",Less than 30 seconds.

tt1229238,"01:49:41,285","01:49:43,703",We're three  and half minutes out.
tt1229238,"01:49:46,185","01:49:48,290",We can make it.
tt1229238,"01:49:49,141","01:49:50,520",We can make it.

tt1229238,"01:50:57,717","01:50:59,819",The missile's in the air.
tt1229238,"01:51:11,999","01:51:13,989",There has to be a way to abort the warhead.
tt1229238,"01:51:13,989","01:51:15,753",If there is a wild on the launch device.
tt1229238,"01:51:15,753","01:51:18,221",We gonna get that case!

tt1229238,"01:52:14,931","01:52:16,706",Wistrom destroyed the relay.
tt1229238,"01:52:16,706","01:52:19,084","- Ethan ran after Hendricks and case, but.. - It doesn't matter if he has the case."
tt1229238,"01:52:19,084","01:52:20,700",We can't transmit the abort codes.
tt1229238,"01:52:20,700","01:52:24,522","- Can you fix it? - ah yeah, but it's gonna be pointless we don't have any power."
tt1229238,"01:52:24,557","01:52:26,102",Wistrom!
tt1229238,"01:52:27,534","01:52:29,918",- Jane? - I'm okay.

tt1229238,"01:58:53,235","01:58:56,298",You wanted me to find you.
tt1229238,"01:58:58,569","01:59:01,548",How else to deal with all these?

tt1229238,"01:59:24,237","01:59:26,771",large enough to be visible during daylight.
tt1229238,"01:59:26,771","01:59:28,923",You actually said that?
tt1229238,"01:59:28,923","01:59:32,242",Outloud? Mission accomplished?
tt1229238,"01:59:32,642","01:59:35,865",- I said it. - You're still cornered Ethan.
tt1229238,"01:59:36,261","01:59:38,986",And I can't imagine the look on that guy's face.
tt1229238,"01:59:40,635","01:59:42,882",- Hey - These must be them.

tt1229238,"02:00:12,784","02:00:16,602",Something about intentional a hundred meters that could drop not being covered.
tt1229238,"02:00:16,611","02:00:18,334",Go figured.

tt1229238,"02:00:38,287","02:00:41,037","All these people are just happy and smiling,"
tt1229238,"02:00:41,037","02:00:45,266","and they are completely oblivious, for the fact they were almost...vaporized."
tt1229238,"02:00:46,104","02:00:49,408",- and if I've been inferred... - Dumb luck?
tt1229238,"02:00:49,931","02:00:51,244",Was it?
tt1229238,"02:00:52,247","02:00:55,990","I mean, look, we were unprepared, in the dark,"
tt1229238,"02:00:55,990","02:00:58,062",disavowed.
tt1229238,"02:00:58,570","02:01:00,841",The only thing that functioned properly

tt1229238,"02:01:32,129","02:01:35,912","Seriously, this is not as hard as any mission gonna rougher than the last one, is it?"
tt1229238,"02:01:37,654","02:01:40,628","It's just ... a bomb, is it?"
tt1229238,"02:01:58,914","02:02:01,578","- Thanks, Ethan. - I thank you."

tt1229238,"02:02:30,840","02:02:33,762",I was there in Croatia.
tt1229238,"02:02:34,656","02:02:37,367",I was there for one reason. One.
tt1229238,"02:02:38,392","02:02:40,724",And I failed.
tt1229238,"02:02:44,152","02:02:46,393",It was my job to protect her.
tt1229238,"02:02:46,393","02:02:49,326",How do you know she's dead?
tt1229238,"02:02:51,240","02:02:55,944",- where's the body? - Did you see it?
