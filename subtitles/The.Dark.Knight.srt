1
00:01:45,089 --> 00:01:47,924
Three of a kind, let's do this. that's it? three guys?

2
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:51,426
Two guys on the roof. every guy gets a share. five shares is plenty.

3
00:01:51,596 --> 00:01:54,051
Six shares. don't forget the guy who planned the job.

4
00:01:54,223 --> 00:01:56,512
He thinks he can sit it out and still take a slice.

5
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:59,804
- I know why they call him the Joker. why do they call him the Joker?

6
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,806
I heard he wears makeup. makeup?

7
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:03,938
Yeah, to scare people. you know, war paint.

8
00:02:16,496 --> 00:02:19,699
All right, everybody, hands up, heads down!

9
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,870
I said, hands up, heads down!

10
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:25,998
Let's go, pal, I'm making a withdrawal here.

11
00:02:26,255 --> 00:02:27,714
- I said, hands up! - no!

12
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:30,332
Here comes the silent alarm.

13
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,838
And there it goes.

14
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:33,209
Heads down!

15
00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:35,713
All right, tootsie, you're taking a dive with me.

16
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,559
- down! I said, stay down there! don't hurt me!

17
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,811
Funny, it didn't dial 911. it was trying to reach a private number.

18
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:43,889
Is it a problem? no, I'm done here.

19
00:02:53,282 --> 00:02:55,655
Sit down! down!

20
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,319
Down! I said, stay down there!

21
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,419
Obviously we don't want you doing anything with your hands...

22
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:08,504
...other than holding on for dear life.

23
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:18,256
On the ground! stay on the ground!

24
00:03:18,433 --> 00:03:22,098
Nobody make a move! nobody! stay down!

25
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:44,491
You have any idea who you're stealing from?

26
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:48,368
- you and your friends are dead. he's out, right?

27
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:52,711
What...?

28
00:04:00,558 --> 00:04:02,301
Where did you learn to count?

29
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:07,144
They wired this thing up with like 5000 volts.

30
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:08,560
What kind of bank does that?

31
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:11,769
A mob bank. I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.

32
00:04:11,944 --> 00:04:12,976
Where's the alarm guy?

33
00:04:13,154 --> 00:04:15,645
Boss told me when the guy was done, I should take him out.

34
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,152
One less share, right?

35
00:04:18,076 --> 00:04:20,317
Funny, he told me something similar.

36
00:04:20,495 --> 00:04:21,953
He what? no! no!

37
00:04:33,675 --> 00:04:35,050
That's a lot of money.

38
00:04:35,218 --> 00:04:38,918
If this Joker guy was so smart, he'd have had us bring a bigger car.

39
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:44,262
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me soon as we loaded the cash.

40
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:48,970
No, no, no, I kill the bus driver.

41
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:50,805
Bus driver?

42
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:54,521
What bus driver?

43
00:04:58,616 --> 00:05:00,525
School's out. time to go.

44
00:05:00,702 --> 00:05:02,943
That guy's not getting up, is he?

45
00:05:03,705 --> 00:05:05,365
That's a lot of money.

46
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:11,202
What happened to the rest of the guys?

47
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:20,341
You think you're smart, huh?

48
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:22,680
The guy that hired youse...

49
00:05:23,224 --> 00:05:25,797
...he'll just do the Same to you.

50
00:05:26,102 --> 00:05:29,056
Oh, criminals in this town used to believe in things.

51
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,511
Honor...

52
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,398
...respect.

53
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:34,892
Look at you. what do you believe in, huh?

54
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:36,350
What do you believe in?!

55
00:05:36,696 --> 00:05:41,607
I believe whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you...

56
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:44,745
...stanger.

57
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:29,622
Mr. mayor, you were elected in a campaign to clean up the city.

58
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,949
- when are you gonna start? I already have.

59
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:33,205
Like this batman.

60
00:06:33,378 --> 00:06:35,951
We're hearing he's doing good, criminals are running scared.

61
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,831
- no, man. I don't like it tonight. - what are you, superstitious?

62
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:43,094
You got more chance of winning the powerball than running into him.

63
00:06:43,262 --> 00:06:46,631
That's not true. our men in the major crimes unit are close to an arrest.

64
00:06:46,808 --> 00:06:49,762
Hey, Wuertz, mayor says you're closing in on the batman.

65
00:06:49,936 --> 00:06:52,059
The investigation is ongoing.

66
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,637
The process of cleaning up the streets is a long one.

67
00:06:54,816 --> 00:06:56,808
I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have...

68
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:03,444
Ever intending to see your wife again, lieutenant?

69
00:07:03,616 --> 00:07:06,285
I thought you had to go look after your mother, detective.

70
00:07:06,452 --> 00:07:08,409
Checked her back into the hospital.

71
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:10,496
I'm sorry.

72
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:14,284
- so he hasn't shown up? - he often doesn't.

73
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:16,377
I like reminding everybody he's out there.

74
00:07:16,546 --> 00:07:17,826
Why wouldn't he come?

75
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:19,999
Hopefully...

76
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:22,050
...because he's busy.

77
00:07:38,776 --> 00:07:41,694
That's why we bring dogs.

78
00:07:41,863 --> 00:07:44,188
- my little princes. please.

79
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:47,948
Please, they're crawling in my mouth. please, I beg you, get them off.

80
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:50,871
Look what your drugs do to my customers.

81
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,663
Buyer beware.

82
00:07:52,832 --> 00:07:56,035
I told you my compound would take you places.

83
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,962
I never said they'd be places you wanted to go.

84
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,668
My business, repeat customers.

85
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:03,549
You don't like what I have to offer...

86
00:08:03,718 --> 00:08:05,461
...you can buy from someone else.

87
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:08,388
Assuming batman left anyone to buy from.

88
00:08:11,726 --> 00:08:15,724
My dogs are hungry.

89
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:21,731
Pity there's only one of you.

90
00:08:29,702 --> 00:08:31,362
What...? that's not him.

91
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,493
Loose the dogs!

92
00:08:50,223 --> 00:08:51,765
That's more like it.

93
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:21,597
Don't let me find you out here again.

94
00:10:21,773 --> 00:10:24,608
- we're trying to help you. I don't need help.

95
00:10:24,776 --> 00:10:26,104
Not my diagnosis.

96
00:10:26,277 --> 00:10:29,860
What gives you the right? what's the difference between you and me?

97
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:32,901
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

98
00:10:36,412 --> 00:10:38,369
Everybody back now!

99
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,708
He can't resist showing us his face.

100
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:50,124
What's he hiding under that makeup?

101
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,520
Uh, can we get a minute, people, please?

102
00:11:03,147 --> 00:11:05,306
Him again. who are the others?

103
00:11:05,483 --> 00:11:07,061
Another bunch of smalltimers.

104
00:11:08,444 --> 00:11:10,152
Some of the marked bills I gave you.

105
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:12,610
My detectives have been making drug buys with them.

106
00:11:12,782 --> 00:11:15,355
This bank was another drop for the mob. that makes five.

107
00:11:15,535 --> 00:11:18,108
- we found the bulk of their dirty cash. - time to move in.

108
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:22,071
We'd have to hit all banks simultaneously. swat teams, backup.

109
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:24,077
What about this Joker guy?

110
00:11:24,252 --> 00:11:27,206
One man or the entire mob? he can wait.

111
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,705
When the new da hears about this, he'll want in.

112
00:11:29,882 --> 00:11:32,420
- do you trust him? - be hard to keep him out.

113
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:36,045
I hear he's as stubborn as you are.

114
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:22,553
Be nice when Wayne manor's rebuilt.

115
00:12:22,727 --> 00:12:25,432
You can swap not sleeping in a penthouse...

116
00:12:25,605 --> 00:12:27,147
...for not sleeping in a mansion.

117
00:12:27,315 --> 00:12:31,063
Whenever you stitch yourself up, you do make a bloody mess.

118
00:12:31,235 --> 00:12:34,236
Yeah. it makes me learn from my mistakes.

119
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:37,821
You ought to be pretty knowledgeable by now, then.

120
00:12:39,535 --> 00:12:40,567
My armor.

121
00:12:40,745 --> 00:12:44,328
I'm carrying too much weight. I need to be... I need to be faster.

122
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:47,168
I'm sure mr. Fox can oblige.

123
00:12:47,335 --> 00:12:49,826
- did you get mauled by a tiger? - it was a dog.

124
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:52,542
- huh? - it was a big dog.

125
00:12:52,715 --> 00:12:56,583
There were more copycats last night, Alfred, with guns.

126
00:12:56,761 --> 00:12:58,670
Why not hire them, take the weekend off?

127
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:01,681
That wasn't exactly what I had in mind...

128
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:03,593
...when I said I wanted to inspire people.

129
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:05,677
I know.

130
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:07,348
But things have improved.

131
00:13:07,563 --> 00:13:10,019
Look at the new district attorney.

132
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:12,684
I am, closely.

133
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,770
Need to know if he can be trusted.

134
00:13:14,946 --> 00:13:18,990
Are you interested in his character or his social circle?

135
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:25,201
Who Rachel spends her time with is her business.

136
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:29,241
I trust you don't have me followed on my day off.

137
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:31,495
If you ever took one, I might.

138
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:35,213
Know your limits, master Wayne.

139
00:13:35,383 --> 00:13:38,503
Batman has no limits.

140
00:13:38,678 --> 00:13:41,714
- well, you do, sir. - well, can't afford to know them.

141
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:44,380
And what's gonna happen on the day that you find out?

142
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,264
We all know how much you like to say "i told you so."

143
00:13:47,437 --> 00:13:50,770
On that day, master Wayne, even I won't want to.

144
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,399
Probably.

145
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,900
Sorry I'm late, folks.

146
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:07,035
- where were you? - worried you'd have to step up?

147
00:14:07,206 --> 00:14:10,207
- Harvey, I know these briefs backwards. - well, then...

148
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:12,369
...fair's fair.

149
00:14:12,545 --> 00:14:14,585
Heads, I'll take it. tails, he's all yours.

150
00:14:14,756 --> 00:14:16,832
Yeah? you wanna flip a coin to see who leads?

151
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:20,424
My father's lucky coin. as I recall, it got me my first date with you.

152
00:14:20,595 --> 00:14:23,761
I wouldn't leave something like that up to chance.

153
00:14:24,098 --> 00:14:27,183
I don't. I make my own luck.

154
00:14:28,686 --> 00:14:32,731
All rise. the honorable judge freel presiding.

155
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:35,568
I thought the da just played golf with the mayor.

156
00:14:35,735 --> 00:14:39,435
Teeoff's 1:30. more than enough time to put you away for life, sally.

157
00:14:39,614 --> 00:14:41,156
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham...

158
00:14:41,324 --> 00:14:44,325
...someone must have stepped up to run the so-called family.

159
00:14:45,203 --> 00:14:47,445
Is that man in this courtroom today?

160
00:14:48,998 --> 00:14:52,616
- could you identify him for us, please? - you win, counselor.

161
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:56,457
It was me.

162
00:14:58,174 --> 00:15:01,958
I have a sworn statement from you that this man...

163
00:15:02,136 --> 00:15:05,837
...Salvatore Maroni, is the new head of the Falcone crime family.

164
00:15:06,015 --> 00:15:10,143
Maroni? he's a fall guy. I'm the brains of the organization.

165
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:13,063
Order. - permission to treat...

166
00:15:13,231 --> 00:15:14,476
...the witness as hostile? - granted.

167
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:15,680
- hostile? I'll show you hostile!

168
00:15:21,906 --> 00:15:24,658
Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in china.

169
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:26,368
If you wanna kill a public servant, mr. Maroni...

170
00:15:26,536 --> 00:15:28,742
...i recommend you buy american.

171
00:15:29,664 --> 00:15:32,285
Get him out of here. - but, your honor, I'm not done.

172
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:39,289
We'll never be able to link the gun to Maroni, so we can't charge him.

173
00:15:39,465 --> 00:15:42,252
But they're trying to kill you, means we're getting to them.

174
00:15:42,427 --> 00:15:45,546
I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel. I'm fine, by the way.

175
00:15:45,722 --> 00:15:47,430
Come on, Harvey. you're Gotham's da.

176
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:50,434
You're not getting shot at, you're not doing your job right.

177
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:51,800
But, you know...

178
00:15:51,978 --> 00:15:55,311
...if you said you were rattled, we could take the rest of the day off.

179
00:15:55,481 --> 00:15:58,399
Can't. I dragged the head of the major crimes unit down here.

180
00:15:58,568 --> 00:16:03,313
Oh, Jim Gordon? he's a friend, actually. try to be nice.

181
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:15,160
I hear you got a hell of a right cross.

182
00:16:18,463 --> 00:16:20,586
It's a shame sal's going to walk.

183
00:16:20,757 --> 00:16:22,672
Yeah, well, good thing about the mob

184
00:16:22,673 --> 00:16:24,801
Is they keep giving you second chances

185
00:16:29,974 --> 00:16:32,299
Lightly irradiated bills.

186
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:35,057
Fancy stuff for a city cop. have help?

187
00:16:35,521 --> 00:16:37,229
We liaise with various agencies...

188
00:16:37,398 --> 00:16:39,142
Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.

189
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:42,900
Official policy is to arrest the vigilante known as batman on sight.

190
00:16:43,071 --> 00:16:45,229
Mm-hm. what about that floodlight on the top of mcu?

191
00:16:45,406 --> 00:16:47,814
If you got problems with malfunctioning equipment...

192
00:16:47,992 --> 00:16:51,195
...i suggest you take them up with maintenance, counselor.

193
00:16:51,496 --> 00:16:54,034
I've put every money Launderer in Gotham behind bars...

194
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:56,579
...but the mob is still getting its money out.

195
00:16:56,751 --> 00:17:00,202
I think you and your friend have found the last game in town.

196
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,084
You're trying to hit them where it hurts, their wallets.

197
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:04,420
It's bold.

198
00:17:05,468 --> 00:17:06,499
You gonna count me in?

199
00:17:07,053 --> 00:17:10,422
In this town, the fewer people know something, the safer the operation.

200
00:17:10,598 --> 00:17:12,840
I don't like that you got your own special unit...

201
00:17:13,017 --> 00:17:15,935
...and it's full of cops I investigated at internal affairs.

202
00:17:16,104 --> 00:17:18,939
If I didn't work with cops you'd investigated while at ia...

203
00:17:19,107 --> 00:17:20,352
...i'd be working alone.

204
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:23,018
I don't get political points for being an idealist.

205
00:17:23,194 --> 00:17:25,602
I do the best I can with what I have.

206
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,949
You want me to back warrants for search and seizure on five banks...

207
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:34,947
...without telling me what we're after.

208
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,614
I can give you the names of the banks.

209
00:17:38,793 --> 00:17:40,702
Well, that's a start.

210
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:43,412
I'll get you your warrants, but I want your trust.

211
00:17:43,589 --> 00:17:45,249
Oh, you don't have to sell me, Dent.

212
00:17:45,425 --> 00:17:47,417
We all know you're Gotham's White knight.

213
00:17:48,678 --> 00:17:52,129
Yeah, well, I heard they have a different name for me down at mcu.

214
00:17:52,724 --> 00:17:54,004
I wouldn't know about that.

215
00:17:55,184 --> 00:17:58,968
In china, Lau security investments stands for dynamic new growth.

216
00:17:59,147 --> 00:18:03,441
A joint chinese venture with Wayne enterprises will be a powerhouse.

217
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:05,519
Well, mr. Lau...

218
00:18:05,903 --> 00:18:08,655
...i speak for the rest of the board...

219
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,158
...and mr. Wayne, in expressing our own excitement.

220
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,543
Sir, I know mr. Wayne is curious

221
00:18:18,544 --> 00:18:20,658
About how his trust fund gets replenished..

222
00:18:20,835 --> 00:18:23,326
...but, frankly, this is embarrassing.

223
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:26,078
You worry about the diligence, mr. Reese.

224
00:18:26,257 --> 00:18:28,546
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

225
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:30,260
It's done.

226
00:18:30,428 --> 00:18:32,171
The numbers are solid.

227
00:18:32,347 --> 00:18:33,889
Do them again.

228
00:18:34,057 --> 00:18:37,141
Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out, now, would we?

229
00:18:39,854 --> 00:18:41,479
Another long night?

230
00:18:41,647 --> 00:18:44,601
This joint venture was your idea, and the consultants love it.

231
00:18:45,276 --> 00:18:46,521
But I'm not convinced.

232
00:18:46,694 --> 00:18:50,359
Lau's company has grown by 8 percent annually like clockwork.

233
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:52,939
His revenue stream must be off the books...

234
00:18:53,117 --> 00:18:54,528
...maybe even illegal.

235
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:56,362
Okay. cancel the deal.

236
00:18:57,705 --> 00:18:58,868
You already knew.

237
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:02,120
Just needed a closer look at their books.

238
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:04,333
Anything else you can trouble me for?

239
00:19:04,796 --> 00:19:06,338
I need a new suit.

240
00:19:06,506 --> 00:19:08,997
Yeah. three buttons is a little '90s, mr. Wayne.

241
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:12,295
I'm not talking fashion, mr. Fox, so much as function.

242
00:19:13,346 --> 00:19:15,054
You wanna be able to turn your head.

243
00:19:15,223 --> 00:19:17,299
Sure make backing out of the driveway easier.

244
00:19:17,767 --> 00:19:19,309
I'll see what I can do.

245
00:19:24,065 --> 00:19:26,022
Took three weeks to get a reservation here.

246
00:19:26,192 --> 00:19:28,315
I had to tell them I work for the government.

247
00:19:28,486 --> 00:19:29,731
- really? - health inspector's...

248
00:19:29,904 --> 00:19:31,149
...not afraid to pull strings.

249
00:19:31,322 --> 00:19:33,529
Rachel. fancy that.

250
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,191
Yeah, Bruce. fancy that.

251
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:38,694
Rachel, natascha. natascha, Rachel.

252
00:19:38,871 --> 00:19:44,245
- natascha. are you the prima...? - prima ballerina for the moscow ballet.

253
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:47,752
- wow. Harvey's taking me next week. - really? so you're into ballet?

254
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:50,247
Bruce. this is Harvey Dent.

255
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:54,340
The famous Bruce Wayne. Rachel's told me everything about you.

256
00:19:54,512 --> 00:19:55,710
I certainly hope not.

257
00:19:56,055 --> 00:19:59,389
- let's put a couple tables together. - I'm not sure that they'll let us.

258
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:02,595
Oh, they should. I own the place.

259
00:20:03,062 --> 00:20:06,016
How could you want to raise children in a city like this?

260
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,148
Well, I was raised here. I turned out okay.

261
00:20:08,317 --> 00:20:09,895
Is Wayne manor in the city limits?

262
00:20:11,738 --> 00:20:13,280
The palisades? sure.

263
00:20:13,448 --> 00:20:15,903
You know, as our new da, you might wanna figure out...

264
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:17,902
...where your jurisdiction ends.

265
00:20:18,077 --> 00:20:22,027
I'm talking about the kind of city that idolizes a masked vigilante.

266
00:20:22,206 --> 00:20:25,575
Gotham city is proud of an ordinary citizen standing up for what's right.

267
00:20:25,752 --> 00:20:27,993
Gotham needs heroes like you, elected officials...

268
00:20:28,171 --> 00:20:30,128
...not a man who thinks he's above the law.

269
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:31,460
Who appointed the batman?

270
00:20:31,632 --> 00:20:35,464
We did. all of us who stood by and let scum take control of our city.

271
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:37,380
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

272
00:20:37,555 --> 00:20:39,298
When their enemies were at the gates...

273
00:20:39,474 --> 00:20:41,229
...the romans would suspend democracy

274
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,174
And appoint one man to protect the city

275
00:20:43,353 --> 00:20:45,926
It wasn't considered an honor, it was a public service.

276
00:20:46,105 --> 00:20:47,765
Harvey, the last man that they appointed...

277
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,229
...to protect the republic was named caesar...

278
00:20:50,401 --> 00:20:53,817
...and he never gave up his power. - okay, fine.

279
00:20:53,988 --> 00:20:55,317
You either die a hero...

280
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,526
...or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.

281
00:20:58,701 --> 00:21:02,201
Whoever the batman is, he doesn't wanna do this for the rest of his life.

282
00:21:02,372 --> 00:21:05,622
How could he? batman is looking for someone to take up his mantle.

283
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:08,080
Someone like you, mr. Dent?

284
00:21:08,544 --> 00:21:11,000
Maybe. if I'm up to it.

285
00:21:11,172 --> 00:21:16,415
What if Harvey Dent is the caped crusader? hm?

286
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,846
If I were sneaking out every night, someone would've noticed by now.

287
00:21:24,227 --> 00:21:28,355
Well, I'm sold, Dent, and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.

288
00:21:28,523 --> 00:21:31,358
That's nice, but I'm not up for reelection for three years.

289
00:21:31,526 --> 00:21:33,435
No, you don't understand.

290
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:36,398
One fundraiser with my pals...

291
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:39,154
...you'll never need another cent.

292
00:21:53,881 --> 00:21:56,004
What the hell is this?

293
00:21:57,343 --> 00:22:00,463
As you're all aware, one of our deposits was stolen.

294
00:22:00,638 --> 00:22:04,007
A relatively small amount, 68 million.

295
00:22:04,183 --> 00:22:06,721
Who's stupid enough to steal from us?

296
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:10,596
Two-bit wackjob, wears a cheap purple suit and makeup.

297
00:22:10,773 --> 00:22:12,730
He's not the problem. he's a nobody.

298
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,269
The problem is our money being tracked by the cops.

299
00:22:16,446 --> 00:22:18,937
Thanks to mr. Maroni's well-placed sources...

300
00:22:19,115 --> 00:22:20,812
... we know that police have indeed

301
00:22:20,814 --> 00:22:22,899
Identified our banks using marked bills..

302
00:22:23,077 --> 00:22:25,568
... and are planning to seize your funds today.

303
00:22:25,747 --> 00:22:27,645
And since the enthusiastic new d a has

304
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,744
Put all my competitors out of business..

305
00:22:30,376 --> 00:22:33,876
...i'm your only option. so, what are you proposing?

306
00:22:34,047 --> 00:22:37,712
Moving all deposits to one secure location, not a bank.

307
00:22:37,884 --> 00:22:39,841
- where, then? - no one can know but me.

308
00:22:40,595 --> 00:22:43,346
If the police were to gain leverage over one of you...

309
00:22:43,514 --> 00:22:45,306
... everyone's money would be at stake.

310
00:22:45,475 --> 00:22:47,598
What stop them getting to you?

311
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:50,853
I go to hong kong, far from Dent's jurisdiction...

312
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,101
... and the chinese will not extradite one of their own.

313
00:22:54,275 --> 00:22:55,900
How soon can you move the money?

314
00:22:56,194 --> 00:22:57,273
I already have.

315
00:22:59,655 --> 00:23:02,277
For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait for your permission.

316
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:06,574
Rest assured, your money is safe.

317
00:23:18,925 --> 00:23:21,167
And I thought my jokes were bad.

318
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,428
Give me one reason why I shouldn't have my boy pull your head off.

319
00:23:24,597 --> 00:23:25,878
How about a magic trick?

320
00:23:29,227 --> 00:23:31,552
I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.

321
00:23:33,856 --> 00:23:34,971
Ta-da!

322
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:36,644
It's...

323
00:23:36,818 --> 00:23:39,106
It's gone.

324
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:41,812
Oh, and by the way, the suit, it wasn't cheap.

325
00:23:41,989 --> 00:23:44,825
- you ought to know, you bought it. sit.

326
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,946
I want to hear proposition.

327
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:54,157
Let's wind the clocks back a year.

328
00:23:54,502 --> 00:24:00,172
These cops and lawyers wouldn't dare cross any of you.

329
00:24:01,342 --> 00:24:03,465
I mean, what happened?

330
00:24:03,636 --> 00:24:07,420
Did your balls drop off? hm?

331
00:24:07,598 --> 00:24:09,638
You see, a guy like me...

332
00:24:10,101 --> 00:24:12,853
- a freak. damn right.

333
00:24:13,021 --> 00:24:16,140
A guy like me... look, listen.

334
00:24:16,691 --> 00:24:20,985
I know why you choose to have your little, ahem...

335
00:24:21,154 --> 00:24:23,858
...group-therapy sessions in broad daylight.

336
00:24:24,365 --> 00:24:27,152
I know why you're afraid to go out at night.

337
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,030
The batman.

338
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:36,448
See, batman has shown Gotham your true colors, unfortunately.

339
00:24:36,627 --> 00:24:40,127
Dent, he's just the beginning.

340
00:24:40,715 --> 00:24:45,460
And as for the television's so-called plan...

341
00:24:45,928 --> 00:24:47,802
...batman has no jurisdiction.

342
00:24:47,972 --> 00:24:50,546
He'll find him and make him squeal.

343
00:24:50,725 --> 00:24:53,726
I know the squealers when I see them...

344
00:24:56,314 --> 00:24:57,808
What do you propose?

345
00:24:57,982 --> 00:25:00,390
It's simple. we, uh, kill the batman.

346
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:04,690
If it's so simple, why haven't you done it already?

347
00:25:04,864 --> 00:25:07,569
If you're good at something, never do it for free.

348
00:25:08,242 --> 00:25:09,523
How much you want?

349
00:25:10,244 --> 00:25:12,237
Uh, half.

350
00:25:14,457 --> 00:25:17,209
You're crazy. - no, I'm not.

351
00:25:17,377 --> 00:25:19,499
No, I'm not.

352
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:24,505
If we don't deal with this now...

353
00:25:24,676 --> 00:25:26,300
...soon...

354
00:25:26,511 --> 00:25:31,422
...little Gambol here won't be able to get a nickel for his grandma.

355
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,558
Enough from the clown!

356
00:25:33,726 --> 00:25:36,680
Ah, ta-ta-ta. let's not blow...

357
00:25:36,854 --> 00:25:39,392
Shit! ...this out of proportion.

358
00:25:39,565 --> 00:25:42,056
You think you can steal from us and just walk away?

359
00:25:42,235 --> 00:25:43,777
- yeah. I'm putting the word out.

360
00:25:43,945 --> 00:25:46,234
Five hundred grand for this clown dead.

361
00:25:46,406 --> 00:25:49,442
A million alive, so I can teach him some manners first.

362
00:25:50,743 --> 00:25:53,317
All right. so, listen, why don't you give me a call...

363
00:25:53,496 --> 00:25:57,245
...when you wanna start taking things a little more seriously?

364
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:59,290
Here's my card.

365
00:26:19,397 --> 00:26:21,769
You're a hard man to reach.

366
00:26:24,777 --> 00:26:27,066
Lau's halfway to hong kong.

367
00:26:28,364 --> 00:26:31,199
If you'd have asked, I could have taken his passport.

368
00:26:31,367 --> 00:26:34,037
All that was left in the vaults were marked bills.

369
00:26:34,203 --> 00:26:37,489
They knew we were coming. as soon as your office got involved...

370
00:26:37,665 --> 00:26:38,696
My office?

371
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:40,459
You're sitting down there with scum

372
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,540
Like Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking..

373
00:26:42,712 --> 00:26:45,832
Oh, yeah. I almost had your rookie cold on a racketeering beat.

374
00:26:46,007 --> 00:26:48,251
Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly

375
00:26:48,252 --> 00:26:50,550
Maroni's got people in your office, Dent

376
00:26:53,348 --> 00:26:55,305
We need Lau back...

377
00:26:55,475 --> 00:26:59,424
...but the chinese won't extradite a national under any circumstances.

378
00:26:59,771 --> 00:27:02,475
If I get him to you, can you get him to talk?

379
00:27:02,648 --> 00:27:03,847
I'll get him to sing.

380
00:27:04,025 --> 00:27:06,777
We're going after the mob's life savings.

381
00:27:06,944 --> 00:27:08,189
Things will get ugly.

382
00:27:08,363 --> 00:27:10,651
I knew the risk when I took this job, lieutenant.

383
00:27:10,823 --> 00:27:12,365
How will you get him back, any...?

384
00:27:14,952 --> 00:27:16,363
He does that.

385
00:27:16,537 --> 00:27:20,037
Our chinese friends left town before I could tell them the deal was off.

386
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:23,707
Well, I'm sure that you've always wanted to go to hong kong.

387
00:27:23,878 --> 00:27:26,036
What's wrong with a phone call?

388
00:27:26,214 --> 00:27:29,832
I think mr. Lau deserves a more personal touch.

389
00:27:31,052 --> 00:27:32,879
Now, for high-altitude jumps...

390
00:27:33,054 --> 00:27:35,841
...you're going to need oxygen and stabilizers.

391
00:27:36,015 --> 00:27:39,633
Well, I must say, compared to your usual requests...

392
00:27:39,811 --> 00:27:42,384
...jumping out of an airplane is pretty straightforward.

393
00:27:43,022 --> 00:27:45,145
What about getting back into the plane?

394
00:27:45,316 --> 00:27:49,148
- I'd recommend a good travel agent. - without it landing.

395
00:27:50,321 --> 00:27:53,073
Now, that's more like it, mr. Wayne.

396
00:27:53,616 --> 00:27:56,237
The cia had a program back in the '60s...

397
00:27:56,411 --> 00:27:59,744
...for getting their people out of hot spots called sky hook.

398
00:27:59,914 --> 00:28:02,583
- we could look into that. - yeah.

399
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,410
Okay. now...

400
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,625
Hardened kevlar plates over titanium-dipped...

401
00:28:08,798 --> 00:28:10,921
...tri-weave fibers for flexibility.

402
00:28:11,092 --> 00:28:13,927
You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.

403
00:28:17,432 --> 00:28:19,590
Perhaps you should read the instructions first?

404
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:21,760
- yeah. - now, there is a tradeoff.

405
00:28:21,936 --> 00:28:25,435
Separation of the plates makes you more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

406
00:28:25,606 --> 00:28:28,560
We wouldn't wanna make things too easy, now, would we?

407
00:28:28,735 --> 00:28:30,774
How will it hold up against dogs?

408
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:33,068
We talking rottweilers or chihuahuas?

409
00:28:34,282 --> 00:28:36,773
Should do fine against cats.

410
00:28:36,951 --> 00:28:39,074
I found one in arizona.

411
00:28:39,245 --> 00:28:42,163
A very nice man said he could have it up and running in a week...

412
00:28:42,331 --> 00:28:43,411
...and he takes cash.

413
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:46,418
- what about the flight crew? - south korean smugglers.

414
00:28:46,586 --> 00:28:48,792
They run flights into pyongyang, below radar.

415
00:28:48,963 --> 00:28:51,715
- did you think of an alibi? - oh, yes.

416
00:29:10,485 --> 00:29:13,106
I believe this is your plane, sir.

417
00:29:17,325 --> 00:29:20,824
You look tired, Alfred. you'll be all right without me?

418
00:29:22,497 --> 00:29:25,996
If you can tell me the russian for "apply your own bloody suntan lotion."

419
00:29:37,136 --> 00:29:40,968
Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you. they say they've just killed the Joker.

420
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,967
They brought the body.

421
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:01,858
So, dead, that's 500.

422
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,621
How about alive? hm?

423
00:30:08,835 --> 00:30:12,001
You wanna know how I got these scars?

424
00:30:13,923 --> 00:30:16,924
My father was...

425
00:30:17,093 --> 00:30:18,552
...a drinker...

426
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,965
...and a fiend.

427
00:30:20,805 --> 00:30:24,969
And one night, he goes off crazier than usual.

428
00:30:25,393 --> 00:30:28,180
Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself.

429
00:30:28,354 --> 00:30:29,896
He doesn't like that...

430
00:30:30,064 --> 00:30:33,516
...not one bit.

431
00:30:33,693 --> 00:30:36,231
So, me watching...

432
00:30:36,404 --> 00:30:40,982
...he takes the knife to her, Laughing while he does it.

433
00:30:44,412 --> 00:30:48,077
He turns to me and said "why so serious?"

434
00:30:48,332 --> 00:30:49,910
He comes at me with the knife.

435
00:30:50,585 --> 00:30:52,494
"why so serious?"

436
00:30:54,756 --> 00:30:57,626
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

437
00:30:57,967 --> 00:31:01,881
"let's put a smile on that face."

438
00:31:03,097 --> 00:31:05,304
And...

439
00:31:07,685 --> 00:31:09,227
Why so serious?

440
00:31:14,275 --> 00:31:15,769
Now...

441
00:31:15,943 --> 00:31:18,185
...our operation is small...

442
00:31:18,363 --> 00:31:21,280
...but there is a lot of potential...

443
00:31:21,449 --> 00:31:23,987
...for aggressive expansion.

444
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,363
So which of you fine gentlemen would like to join our team?

445
00:31:27,538 --> 00:31:31,951
Oh. there's only one spot open right now, so we're gonna have...

446
00:31:32,627 --> 00:31:34,785
...tryouts.

447
00:31:39,384 --> 00:31:41,376
Make it fast.

448
00:31:50,812 --> 00:31:52,222
Welcome to hong kong, mr. Fox.

449
00:31:52,397 --> 00:31:55,101
Mr. Lau regrets he is unable to greet you in person today.

450
00:31:55,274 --> 00:31:57,184
I understand.

451
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:10,577
For security purposes, I'm gonna have to ask you to check in your mobile.

452
00:32:10,748 --> 00:32:12,326
Of course.

453
00:32:15,086 --> 00:32:18,786
I must apologize for leaving Gotham in the middle of our negotiations.

454
00:32:18,965 --> 00:32:22,500
This misunderstanding with the Gotham police force...

455
00:32:22,677 --> 00:32:25,215
...i couldn't let it threaten my company. - of course.

456
00:32:25,388 --> 00:32:28,555
A businessman of your stature will understand and...

457
00:32:28,725 --> 00:32:32,674
...with you here now, we can continue.

458
00:32:32,854 --> 00:32:34,545
Well, I do appreciate you bringing me

459
00:32:34,546 --> 00:32:36,602
Out here in such style, mr. Lau, but I re..

460
00:32:38,151 --> 00:32:39,977
We do not allow cell phones in here.

461
00:32:40,153 --> 00:32:42,857
I'm sorry. forgot I had it.

462
00:32:43,031 --> 00:32:45,127
No, I really came to tell you that

463
00:32:45,128 --> 00:32:47,657
Our business deal has to be put on hold

464
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:51,287
You see, we can't afford to be seen to do business with...

465
00:32:52,415 --> 00:32:54,372
...whatever it is you're accused of being.

466
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:57,115
I'm sure a businessman of your stature will understand.

467
00:32:57,295 --> 00:33:01,209
I think, mr. Fox, a simple phone call might have sufficed.

468
00:33:01,382 --> 00:33:04,751
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think he was deliberately wasting your time.

469
00:33:04,927 --> 00:33:06,552
Just accidentally wasting it.

470
00:33:07,555 --> 00:33:11,719
That's very good, mr. Lau. "accidentally." very good.

471
00:33:12,518 --> 00:33:13,847
Hey, sir.

472
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,072
There's a better view from the peak tram.

473
00:33:34,248 --> 00:33:36,075
How's the view from lsi holdings?

474
00:33:36,376 --> 00:33:37,918
Restricted.

475
00:33:38,086 --> 00:33:40,078
Lau is holed up in there good and tight.

476
00:33:40,254 --> 00:33:42,164
- what's this? - I had r & d work it up.

477
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,000
Sends out a high-frequency pulse...

478
00:33:44,175 --> 00:33:47,010
...records the response time for mapping an environment.

479
00:33:47,512 --> 00:33:50,085
Sonar. just like a...

480
00:33:50,264 --> 00:33:52,423
Submarine, mr. Wayne. like a submarine.

481
00:33:52,934 --> 00:33:54,761
- and the other device? - it's in place.

482
00:33:55,687 --> 00:33:56,718
Mr. Wayne?

483
00:33:57,939 --> 00:33:59,219
Good luck.

484
00:37:49,212 --> 00:37:52,378
Look, give us the money and we'll talk about making a deal.

485
00:37:52,548 --> 00:37:55,834
The money is the only reason I'm still alive.

486
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,943
Oh, you mean, when they find out that

487
00:37:57,944 --> 00:38:00,138
You've helped us, they're gonna kill you

488
00:38:00,306 --> 00:38:02,014
- are you threatening my client? - no.

489
00:38:02,183 --> 00:38:06,395
I'm just assuming your client's cooperation with this investigation.

490
00:38:08,022 --> 00:38:09,682
As will everyone.

491
00:38:11,025 --> 00:38:14,359
No? okay.

492
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:17,822
Enjoy your time in county, mr. Lau.

493
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,485
Wait!

494
00:38:19,701 --> 00:38:21,693
I won't give you the money...

495
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:24,870
...but I will give you my clients, all of them.

496
00:38:25,164 --> 00:38:27,371
You were a glorified accountant.

497
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:31,374
What could you possibly have on all of them that we could charge?

498
00:38:31,546 --> 00:38:35,378
I'm good with calculation. I handled all their investments.

499
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,127
One big pot.

500
00:38:38,511 --> 00:38:39,839
Got it.

501
00:38:40,263 --> 00:38:42,090
One minute.

502
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:45,595
Rico. if they pooled their money...

503
00:38:45,768 --> 00:38:47,560
...we can charge them as one criminal conspiracy.

504
00:38:47,729 --> 00:38:48,891
Charge them with what?

505
00:38:49,063 --> 00:38:51,934
In a Rico case, if you can charge one of them with a felony...

506
00:38:52,108 --> 00:38:54,681
You can charge all of them with it. that's great.

507
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,979
Mr. Lau.

508
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:02,988
What kind of details do you have about this communal fund?

509
00:39:03,161 --> 00:39:04,785
- ledgers...? - immunity, protection...

510
00:39:04,954 --> 00:39:08,405
...a chartered plane back to hong kong. - after you testify in open court.

511
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:10,908
I'm just curious. with all your clients locked up...

512
00:39:11,252 --> 00:39:13,458
...what's gonna happen with all that money?

513
00:39:13,629 --> 00:39:16,749
Like I said, I'm good with calculation.

514
00:39:16,924 --> 00:39:21,586
He can't go to county. I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

515
00:39:21,763 --> 00:39:24,301
What is this, Gordon, your fortress?

516
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:27,268
Well, you trust them over at county?

517
00:39:27,435 --> 00:39:29,262
I don't trust them here.

518
00:39:31,022 --> 00:39:32,516
Lau stays.

519
00:39:32,982 --> 00:39:35,556
Well, I don 't know about mr. Lau's travel arrangements...

520
00:39:35,735 --> 00:39:37,526
... but I'm sure glad he's back.

521
00:39:37,695 --> 00:39:40,151
Put word out. we hire the clown.

522
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:46,782
He was right. we have to fix real problem.

523
00:39:47,288 --> 00:39:48,403
Batman.

524
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,875
- I'm not aware of any participation... - our boy looks good on the tube.

525
00:39:57,382 --> 00:40:00,133
You sure you wanna embarrass me in front of my friends?

526
00:40:00,301 --> 00:40:03,966
Oh, don't worry. they're coming too.

527
00:40:10,812 --> 00:40:12,638
Have a nice trip. see you next fall.

528
00:40:12,814 --> 00:40:14,640
Seven hundred twelve counts of extortion.

529
00:40:14,816 --> 00:40:17,223
Eight hundred and forty-nine counts of racketeering.

530
00:40:17,402 --> 00:40:19,940
Two hundred and forty-six counts of fraud.

531
00:40:20,113 --> 00:40:22,948
Eighty-seven counts of conspiracy murder.

532
00:40:23,866 --> 00:40:26,986
Five hundred and twenty-seven counts of obstruction of justice.

533
00:40:27,412 --> 00:40:28,787
How do the defendants plead?

534
00:40:35,962 --> 00:40:36,993
Order in the court.

535
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:39,662
Five hundred and forty-nine criminals at once.

536
00:40:39,841 --> 00:40:42,332
How did you convince Surrillo to hear this farce?

537
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:46,638
She shares my enthusiasm for justice. after all, she is a judge.

538
00:40:46,806 --> 00:40:49,842
Even if you blow enough smoke to get convictions out of Surrillo...

539
00:40:50,018 --> 00:40:52,591
...you're gonna set a new record at appeals.

540
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:55,261
It won't matter. the head guys make bail, sure.

541
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,847
But the midlevel guys, they can't.

542
00:40:58,026 --> 00:40:59,852
They can't afford to be off the streets.

543
00:41:00,028 --> 00:41:02,150
They'll cut deals that include some jail time.

544
00:41:02,321 --> 00:41:05,322
Think of all you could do with 18 months of clean streets.

545
00:41:06,868 --> 00:41:09,987
Mr. mayor, you can't... - no, get out. both of you.

546
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:15,709
Sit down.

547
00:41:20,673 --> 00:41:23,674
The public likes you. that's the only reason that this might fly.

548
00:41:23,843 --> 00:41:25,171
But that means it's on you.

549
00:41:25,345 --> 00:41:28,381
They're all gonna come after you now, and not just the mob.

550
00:41:28,556 --> 00:41:32,388
Politicians, journalists, cops.

551
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,051
Anyone whose wallet's about to get lighter.

552
00:41:35,229 --> 00:41:37,899
Are you up to it? you'd better be.

553
00:41:38,066 --> 00:41:40,189
Because they get anything on you...

554
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,665
...and those criminals are back on the

555
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,152
Streets, followed swiftly by you and me

556
00:41:45,323 --> 00:41:46,603
Jesus!

557
00:42:07,762 --> 00:42:10,218
I think your fundraiser will be a great success, sir.

558
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:13,059
And why do you think I wanna hold a party for Harvey Dent?

559
00:42:13,226 --> 00:42:16,310
I assumed it was your usual reason for socializing beyond myself...

560
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:20,481
To try to impress miss Dawes.

561
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:24,730
Very droll, but very wrong. actually, it's Dent.

562
00:42:24,904 --> 00:42:27,775
Police released video footage found concealed on the body.

563
00:42:27,949 --> 00:42:30,570
Sensitive viewers, be aware. the image is disturbing.

564
00:42:30,743 --> 00:42:32,950
Tell them your name.

565
00:42:33,121 --> 00:42:34,781
Brian Douglas.

566
00:42:36,374 --> 00:42:38,699
And are you the real batman?

567
00:42:38,876 --> 00:42:39,908
No. no?

568
00:42:40,086 --> 00:42:42,043
- no. - no?

569
00:42:42,213 --> 00:42:43,921
Then why do you dress up like him?

570
00:42:46,676 --> 00:42:50,756
Because he's a symbol that we don 't have to be afraid of scum like you.

571
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:54,264
Yeah. you do, Brian. you really do.

572
00:42:54,434 --> 00:42:58,052
Huh? yeah. oh, shh, shh, shh.

573
00:42:58,229 --> 00:43:02,690
So you think batman 's made Gotham a better place? hm?

574
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,443
Look at me.

575
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,899
Look at me!

576
00:43:10,658 --> 00:43:14,157
You see, this is how crazy batman 's made Gotham.

577
00:43:14,328 --> 00:43:16,617
You want order in Gotham...

578
00:43:16,956 --> 00:43:21,369
... batman must take off his mask and turn himself in.

579
00:43:21,544 --> 00:43:25,328
Oh, and every day he doesn 't, people will die.

580
00:43:25,673 --> 00:43:27,796
Starting tonight.

581
00:43:28,217 --> 00:43:30,424
I'm a man of my word.

582
00:43:47,695 --> 00:43:50,530
Harvey Dent, scourge of the underworld...

583
00:43:50,698 --> 00:43:53,783
...scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade.

584
00:43:53,951 --> 00:43:55,196
- I'll be back. - Rachel.

585
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:58,205
A little liquid courage, mr. Dent?

586
00:43:58,373 --> 00:44:00,780
- thank you. Alfred, right? - that's right, sir.

587
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:04,244
Rachel talks about you all the time. you've known her her whole life.

588
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,665
Not yet, sir.

589
00:44:07,965 --> 00:44:10,207
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends I should be aware of?

590
00:44:10,385 --> 00:44:12,626
Oh, you have no idea.

591
00:44:31,572 --> 00:44:32,983
I'm sorry that I'm late.

592
00:44:33,157 --> 00:44:35,529
I'm glad to see that you all got started without me.

593
00:44:35,702 --> 00:44:39,402
Now, where is Harvey? where...?

594
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,988
Harvey Dent, the man of the hour.

595
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:43,495
Where's Rachel Dawes?

596
00:44:43,668 --> 00:44:46,040
She is my oldest friend. come here.

597
00:44:46,212 --> 00:44:48,703
When Rachel first told me she was dating Harvey Dent...

598
00:44:48,881 --> 00:44:50,079
...I had one thing to say

599
00:44:50,299 --> 00:44:52,707
"the guy from those god-awful campaign commercials?"

600
00:44:52,885 --> 00:44:56,717
"i believe in Harvey Dent." yeah, nice slogan, Harvey.

601
00:44:56,889 --> 00:44:58,882
But it caught Rachel's attention.

602
00:44:59,058 --> 00:45:02,059
And then I started to pay attention to Harvey...

603
00:45:02,478 --> 00:45:05,764
...and all that he's been doing as our new da.

604
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,731
And you know what?

605
00:45:09,777 --> 00:45:11,271
I believe in Harvey Dent.

606
00:45:11,446 --> 00:45:15,028
I believe that on his watch, Gotham can feel...

607
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:18,864
...a little safer, a little more optimistic.

608
00:45:20,288 --> 00:45:24,617
Look at this face. this is the face of Gotham's bright future.

609
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:26,951
To Harvey Dent. let's hear it for him.

610
00:45:27,337 --> 00:45:28,879
Harvey.

611
00:45:38,389 --> 00:45:39,848
Harvey may not know you well enough...

612
00:45:40,016 --> 00:45:41,973
...to understand you're making fun of him...

613
00:45:42,143 --> 00:45:44,136
...but I do. - no, I meant every word.

614
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,397
You know that day that you once told me about...

615
00:45:48,566 --> 00:45:50,642
...when Gotham would no longer need batman?

616
00:45:50,818 --> 00:45:52,728
- it's coming. - Bruce.

617
00:45:53,571 --> 00:45:56,117
- you can't ask me to wait for that.

618
00:45:56,118 --> 00:45:59,158
- it's happening now. Harvey is that hero

619
00:45:59,327 --> 00:46:01,056
He locked up half of the city's

620
00:46:01,057 --> 00:46:03,788
Criminals, and he did it without wearing a mask

621
00:46:03,956 --> 00:46:06,163
Gotham needs a hero with a face.

622
00:46:07,001 --> 00:46:09,290
You can throw a party, Wayne, I'll give you that.

623
00:46:10,672 --> 00:46:12,581
Thanks again.

624
00:46:13,383 --> 00:46:15,091
You mind if I borrow Rachel?

625
00:46:18,554 --> 00:46:20,927
Lieutenant, that Joker card pinned to the body?

626
00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:22,842
Forensics found three sets of dna.

627
00:46:23,017 --> 00:46:24,428
- any matches? - all three.

628
00:46:24,602 --> 00:46:28,101
The dna belongs to judge Surrillo, Harvey Dent and commissioner loeb.

629
00:46:28,272 --> 00:46:30,265
The Joker's telling us who he's targeting.

630
00:46:30,441 --> 00:46:33,312
Get a unit over to Surrillo's house. tell Wuertz to find Dent.

631
00:46:33,486 --> 00:46:35,526
Protective custody. where's the commissioner?

632
00:46:35,697 --> 00:46:37,191
- city hall. - seal the building.

633
00:46:37,365 --> 00:46:39,357
- no one in or out till I get there. - got it.

634
00:46:51,671 --> 00:46:54,043
Gordon. what are you up to?

635
00:46:54,215 --> 00:46:57,465
We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor search of the entire building.

636
00:46:57,635 --> 00:47:00,209
We believe the Joker's made a threat against your life.

637
00:47:00,388 --> 00:47:01,799
These are dangerous people.

638
00:47:01,973 --> 00:47:03,716
You're not giving me a lot of information.

639
00:47:03,891 --> 00:47:05,849
Even we don't know where you're going.

640
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:09,352
Take the envelope, get in, open it. it'll tell you where you're headed.

641
00:47:13,192 --> 00:47:15,102
You can't leave me alone with these people.

642
00:47:15,278 --> 00:47:18,314
The whole mob's after you and you're worried about these guys?

643
00:47:18,489 --> 00:47:20,446
Compared to this, the mob doesn't scare me.

644
00:47:20,616 --> 00:47:24,199
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this for yourself, so...

645
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:28,450
...take my word, the police commissioner earns a lot of threats.

646
00:47:28,624 --> 00:47:34,164
I found the appropriate response to these situations a long time ago.

647
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,622
Them gunning for you makes you see things clearly.

648
00:47:36,799 --> 00:47:38,128
Yeah, I bet.

649
00:47:38,301 --> 00:47:42,595
Yeah. it makes you think about things you couldn't stand losing...

650
00:47:42,764 --> 00:47:44,756
...about who you wanna spend your life with.

651
00:47:44,932 --> 00:47:47,933
- that's a pretty big commitment. - not if the mob has their way.

652
00:47:53,149 --> 00:47:55,854
You get to explain to my wife...

653
00:47:56,778 --> 00:47:58,355
...why I'm late for dinner.

654
00:47:58,529 --> 00:48:01,696
Sir, the Joker card had traces of your dna on it.

655
00:48:03,284 --> 00:48:05,905
- don't do that. - all right.

656
00:48:06,454 --> 00:48:09,371
- let's be serious, then. - okay.

657
00:48:09,707 --> 00:48:10,738
What's your answer?

658
00:48:16,923 --> 00:48:18,417
I don't have an answer.

659
00:48:20,593 --> 00:48:21,624
How'd they get my dna?

660
00:48:21,803 --> 00:48:23,961
Somebody with access to your office or house...

661
00:48:24,138 --> 00:48:26,760
...must have lifted a tissue or a glass... wait! wait!

662
00:48:26,933 --> 00:48:29,850
- well, I guess no answer is a no. - Harvey.

663
00:48:30,019 --> 00:48:32,142
- it's someone else, isn't it? - Harvey.

664
00:48:32,313 --> 00:48:35,480
Just tell me it's not Wayne. the guy's a complete f...

665
00:48:35,983 --> 00:48:37,442
What are you doing?

666
00:48:48,621 --> 00:48:49,652
Oh, shit.

667
00:48:55,837 --> 00:48:57,580
Get a medic!

668
00:49:01,009 --> 00:49:02,123
They've come for him.

669
00:49:03,636 --> 00:49:04,799
We made it.

670
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:08,421
Stay hidden.

671
00:49:10,685 --> 00:49:14,018
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

672
00:49:16,941 --> 00:49:20,855
We are tonight's entertainment.

673
00:49:21,696 --> 00:49:24,021
I only have one question:

674
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,775
Where is Harvey Dent?

675
00:49:37,253 --> 00:49:39,329
You know where Harvey is? you know who he is?

676
00:49:39,505 --> 00:49:40,786
Hands up, pretty boy.

677
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:50,718
Do you know where I can find Harvey? I need to talk to him.

678
00:49:50,892 --> 00:49:53,727
Just something little, huh? no.

679
00:49:56,022 --> 00:49:58,774
What's going on out there? Wayne!

680
00:50:00,234 --> 00:50:01,610
Oh, thank god, you've got a panic room.

681
00:50:01,778 --> 00:50:02,940
Hey, wait...

682
00:50:03,529 --> 00:50:05,321
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

683
00:50:05,615 --> 00:50:07,607
You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.

684
00:50:07,784 --> 00:50:11,283
We're not intimidated by thugs.

685
00:50:12,246 --> 00:50:13,954
You know...

686
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:18,584
...you remind me of my father.

687
00:50:19,045 --> 00:50:20,872
I hated my father.

688
00:50:21,047 --> 00:50:23,086
Okay, stop.

689
00:50:26,928 --> 00:50:29,763
Well, hello, beautiful.

690
00:50:31,933 --> 00:50:35,765
You must be Harvey's squeeze. hm?

691
00:50:36,145 --> 00:50:38,636
And you are beautiful.

692
00:50:45,571 --> 00:50:49,439
You look nervous. is it the scars?

693
00:50:50,368 --> 00:50:52,574
You wanna know how I got them?

694
00:50:53,788 --> 00:50:56,326
Come here. hey.

695
00:50:56,708 --> 00:50:58,415
Look at me.

696
00:50:58,876 --> 00:51:03,622
So I had a wife. she was beautiful, like you...

697
00:51:03,881 --> 00:51:08,093
...who tells me I worry too much...

698
00:51:08,261 --> 00:51:11,178
...who tells me I ought to smile more...

699
00:51:11,347 --> 00:51:16,852
...who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. hey.

700
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:19,677
One day they carve her face.

701
00:51:20,189 --> 00:51:24,436
And we have no money for surgeries. she can't take it.

702
00:51:24,819 --> 00:51:28,318
I just wanna see her smile again. hm?

703
00:51:28,656 --> 00:51:31,574
I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars.

704
00:51:32,118 --> 00:51:33,660
So...

705
00:51:34,245 --> 00:51:37,910
...i stick a razor in my mouth and do this...

706
00:51:38,374 --> 00:51:39,750
...to myself.

707
00:51:40,043 --> 00:51:45,119
And you know what? she can't stand the sight of me.

708
00:51:45,298 --> 00:51:46,840
She leaves.

709
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:49,958
Now I see the funny side.

710
00:51:50,845 --> 00:51:52,423
Now I'm always smiling.

711
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:59,184
You got a little fight in you. I like that.

712
00:51:59,354 --> 00:52:00,682
Then you're gonna love me.

713
00:52:28,841 --> 00:52:30,039
Drop the gun.

714
00:52:30,218 --> 00:52:32,839
Oh, sure. you just take off your little mask...

715
00:52:33,012 --> 00:52:35,219
...and show us all who you really are. hm?

716
00:52:40,853 --> 00:52:42,051
Let her go.

717
00:52:42,855 --> 00:52:44,266
Very poor choice of words.

718
00:53:07,088 --> 00:53:08,962
Are you all right?

719
00:53:11,217 --> 00:53:13,589
Let's not do that again.

720
00:53:13,886 --> 00:53:16,377
- is Harvey okay? - he's safe.

721
00:53:17,932 --> 00:53:19,261
Thank you.

722
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,632
Jim, it's over.

723
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:23,383
As long as they don't get to Lau, we've cut off their funds.

724
00:53:23,563 --> 00:53:25,057
The prosecution's over.

725
00:53:25,231 --> 00:53:26,891
Nobody's standing up in front of a judge...

726
00:53:27,066 --> 00:53:30,067
...while judges and police commissioners are getting blown away.

727
00:53:30,236 --> 00:53:32,027
- what about Dent? - he's got any sense...

728
00:53:32,196 --> 00:53:33,276
...Dent's halfway to mex...

729
00:53:33,448 --> 00:53:35,025
So where do you keep your trash?

730
00:53:36,367 --> 00:53:37,420
You're due in court.

731
00:53:37,421 --> 00:53:40,317
I need you alive long enough to get you on the record

732
00:53:40,496 --> 00:53:43,533
You can't protect me. you can't even protect yourselves.

733
00:53:43,708 --> 00:53:47,041
You refuse to cooperate, you're not coming back here, you go to county.

734
00:53:47,211 --> 00:53:49,667
How long do you calculate you'll last in there?

735
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:52,584
Targeting me won't get their money.

736
00:53:52,759 --> 00:53:54,585
I knew the mob wouldn't go down easily...

737
00:53:54,761 --> 00:53:56,837
...but this is different. they crossed a line.

738
00:53:57,013 --> 00:53:58,258
You crossed the line first.

739
00:53:58,431 --> 00:54:01,847
You squeezed them, you hammered them to the point of desperation.

740
00:54:02,018 --> 00:54:03,661
And in their desperation,

741
00:54:03,662 --> 00:54:07,012
They turned to a man they didn't fully understand

742
00:54:07,523 --> 00:54:10,061
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.

743
00:54:10,234 --> 00:54:12,441
We just need to figure out what he's after.

744
00:54:12,612 --> 00:54:14,023
With respect, master Wayne...

745
00:54:14,197 --> 00:54:17,151
...perhaps this is a man you don't fully understand either.

746
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:20,655
A long time ago, I was in burma...

747
00:54:20,828 --> 00:54:24,244
...and my friends and I were working for the local government.

748
00:54:24,415 --> 00:54:26,989
They were trying to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders...

749
00:54:27,168 --> 00:54:30,003
...by bribing them with precious stones...

750
00:54:30,171 --> 00:54:32,375
...but their caravans were being raided

751
00:54:32,376 --> 00:54:34,750
In a forest north of rangoon by a bandit

752
00:54:34,926 --> 00:54:38,211
So we went looking for the stones.

753
00:54:38,596 --> 00:54:43,721
But in six months, we never met anyone who traded with him.

754
00:54:44,352 --> 00:54:48,350
One day, I saw a child playing with a ruby...

755
00:54:48,523 --> 00:54:51,559
...the size of a tangerine.

756
00:54:51,818 --> 00:54:55,187
The bandit had been throwing them away.

757
00:54:55,863 --> 00:54:58,568
- so why steal them? - because he thought it was good sport.

758
00:54:58,741 --> 00:55:03,699
Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money.

759
00:55:03,871 --> 00:55:08,118
They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with.

760
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:12,375
Some men just wanna watch the world burn.

761
00:55:32,817 --> 00:55:33,980
Your name, sir?

762
00:55:34,152 --> 00:55:37,318
Eighth and Orchard. you'll find Harvey Dent there.

763
00:55:50,209 --> 00:55:51,668
Check the names.

764
00:55:58,259 --> 00:55:59,967
"richard Dent."

765
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,259
"patrick Harvey."

766
00:56:03,556 --> 00:56:04,587
Harvey Dent.

767
00:56:04,766 --> 00:56:07,767
I need 10 minutes with the scene before your men contaminate it.

768
00:56:07,977 --> 00:56:10,184
It's because of you these guys are dead...

769
00:56:10,355 --> 00:56:11,897
Detective!

770
00:56:14,108 --> 00:56:16,148
Give us a minute, guys.

771
00:56:17,362 --> 00:56:18,939
That's brick underneath.

772
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,940
Gonna take ballistics off a shattered bullet?

773
00:56:21,115 --> 00:56:22,740
No.

774
00:56:24,202 --> 00:56:26,111
Fingerprints.

775
00:56:34,671 --> 00:56:36,580
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

776
00:56:38,383 --> 00:56:43,091
Because we found his next target. he's put it in tomorrow's paper.

777
00:57:00,405 --> 00:57:02,693
I'm not sure you made it loud enough, sir.

778
00:57:15,795 --> 00:57:17,918
What can I do for you, mr. Reese?

779
00:57:18,089 --> 00:57:21,873
You wanted me to do the diligence on the lsi holdings deal again.

780
00:57:22,552 --> 00:57:24,840
Well, I found some irregularities.

781
00:57:25,263 --> 00:57:27,339
Their ceo is in police custody.

782
00:57:27,515 --> 00:57:30,433
No, not with their numbers, with yours.

783
00:57:30,643 --> 00:57:33,727
Applied sciences. whole division of Wayne enterprises...

784
00:57:33,896 --> 00:57:35,556
...just disappeared overnight.

785
00:57:35,732 --> 00:57:39,979
I went down to the archives and I started pulling some old files.

786
00:57:41,112 --> 00:57:42,986
Don't tell me you didn't recognize your baby...

787
00:57:43,156 --> 00:57:46,774
...pancaking cop cars on the evening news.

788
00:57:47,076 --> 00:57:50,279
Now you got the entire r & d department burning through cash...

789
00:57:50,455 --> 00:57:53,788
...claiming it's related to cell phones for the army?

790
00:57:53,958 --> 00:57:57,042
What are you building for him now, a rocket ship?

791
00:57:58,921 --> 00:58:00,665
I want...

792
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:04,754
...$ 10 million a year for the rest of my life.

793
00:58:07,263 --> 00:58:09,386
Let me get this straight.

794
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,055
You think that your client...

795
00:58:13,227 --> 00:58:16,312
One of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world...

796
00:58:16,481 --> 00:58:18,058
...is secretly a vigilante...

797
00:58:18,232 --> 00:58:20,222
...who spends his nights beating

798
00:58:20,223 --> 00:58:22,894
Criminals to a pulp with his bare hands..

799
00:58:23,071 --> 00:58:26,237
...and your plan is to blackmail this person?

800
00:58:33,706 --> 00:58:34,987
Good luck.

801
00:58:37,877 --> 00:58:39,288
When...

802
00:58:40,713 --> 00:58:42,172
Keep that.

803
00:58:48,846 --> 00:58:51,302
This is your original scan.

804
00:58:52,725 --> 00:58:55,014
Here it is reengineered.

805
00:59:03,236 --> 00:59:06,771
And there's the thumbprint he left when he pushed the round in the clip.

806
00:59:08,783 --> 00:59:09,946
I'll get you a copy.

807
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:13,943
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign r & d?

808
00:59:14,122 --> 00:59:16,613
Yeah. government telecommunications project.

809
00:59:16,791 --> 00:59:18,830
Wasn't aware we had any government contracts.

810
00:59:19,085 --> 00:59:22,086
You know, Lucius, I'm playing this one pretty close to the chest.

811
00:59:23,214 --> 00:59:24,922
Fair enough.

812
00:59:27,844 --> 00:59:29,302
With no word from the batman...

813
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:30,965
...even as they mourn commissioner loeb...

814
00:59:31,139 --> 00:59:34,508
...these cops have to wonder if the Joker will make good on his threat...

815
00:59:34,684 --> 00:59:37,887
...in the obituary column of the Gotham times to kill the mayor.

816
00:59:39,689 --> 00:59:43,354
I've checked all the databases. there are four possibles.

817
00:59:43,526 --> 00:59:45,649
Cross-reference the addresses.

818
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:49,818
Look for parkside, overlooking the parade.

819
00:59:51,034 --> 00:59:52,148
I got one.

820
00:59:52,326 --> 00:59:56,324
Melvin White, 1502 Randolph apartments.

821
00:59:56,706 --> 01:00:00,786
Aggravated assault, moved to Arkham twice.

822
01:00:39,874 --> 01:00:41,452
What do you got on the roof?

823
01:00:41,626 --> 01:00:45,161
We're tight, but frankly, there's a lot of windows up here.

824
01:00:53,721 --> 01:00:57,766
Commissioner loeb dedicated his life to law enforcement...

825
01:00:57,934 --> 01:01:00,223
...and to the protection of his community.

826
01:01:00,395 --> 01:01:02,186
I remember when I first took office...

827
01:01:02,355 --> 01:01:04,893
...and I asked if he wanted to stay on as commissioner.

828
01:01:05,066 --> 01:01:10,309
And he said he would, provided I kept my politics out of his office.

829
01:01:14,075 --> 01:01:17,242
Clearly he was not a man who minced words, nor should he have been.

830
01:01:18,413 --> 01:01:21,912
A number of policies that he enacted as commissioner were unpopular.

831
01:01:22,083 --> 01:01:25,333
Policies that flooded my office with angry calls and letters...

832
01:01:29,716 --> 01:01:31,376
- who's that? - what happened?

833
01:01:32,427 --> 01:01:34,300
They took our guns.

834
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:36,262
And our uniforms.

835
01:01:42,854 --> 01:01:45,605
And as we recognize the sacrifice of this man...

836
01:01:45,773 --> 01:01:49,723
...we must remember that vigilance is the price of safety.

837
01:01:49,902 --> 01:01:52,393
Stand by. honor guard.

838
01:01:52,572 --> 01:01:56,190
Attention. port arms.

839
01:01:57,410 --> 01:02:01,787
Ready! aim! fire!

840
01:02:02,582 --> 01:02:04,124
Ready! aim!

841
01:02:07,754 --> 01:02:10,126
Ready! aim!

842
01:02:18,556 --> 01:02:19,967
Stay down! don't move!

843
01:02:21,809 --> 01:02:23,469
Mr. mayor. get him out of here.

844
01:02:32,695 --> 01:02:34,937
- I'll see you later. - why are you going back?

845
01:02:47,585 --> 01:02:48,616
Get out of here.

846
01:02:52,674 --> 01:02:54,417
Tell me what you know about the Joker.

847
01:03:25,456 --> 01:03:26,785
No.

848
01:03:27,208 --> 01:03:28,536
I'm sorry, Barbara.

849
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:32,710
Jimmy, go play with your sister. go ahead, honey.

850
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,122
If there's anything we can do, anything you need...

851
01:03:35,299 --> 01:03:37,043
...we're here for you.

852
01:03:40,722 --> 01:03:41,967
Are you out there?

853
01:03:43,307 --> 01:03:47,804
Are you? you brought this craziness on us. you did!

854
01:03:47,979 --> 01:03:50,351
You brought this on us!

855
01:03:51,399 --> 01:03:55,977
Switch it off, he ain't coming. he doesn't wanna talk to us.

856
01:03:56,404 --> 01:03:59,405
God help whoever he does wanna talk to.

857
01:04:01,075 --> 01:04:03,993
Can't we go someplace quieter? we can't hear each other talk.

858
01:04:04,162 --> 01:04:06,997
What makes you think I wanna hear you talk?

859
01:04:07,165 --> 01:04:08,196
What?

860
01:04:37,612 --> 01:04:39,236
- yeah? second.

861
01:04:39,405 --> 01:04:40,436
Okay.

862
01:04:40,615 --> 01:04:42,773
- Harvey, where are you? where are you?

863
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:45,073
I'm where you should be, at major crimes.

864
01:04:45,244 --> 01:04:46,787
I'm trying to deal with all of this mess.

865
01:04:46,954 --> 01:04:48,654
- can I get the fingerprint analysis?

866
01:04:48,655 --> 01:04:50,537
- Rachel, listen to me. you're not safe there

867
01:04:50,708 --> 01:04:52,500
- this is Gordon's unit. - Gordon 's gone.

868
01:04:52,669 --> 01:04:56,251
He vouched for these men. - and he's gone.

869
01:05:00,885 --> 01:05:02,961
The Joker's named you next.

870
01:05:03,137 --> 01:05:06,138
God, is there someone, is there anyone in this town we can trust?

871
01:05:06,307 --> 01:05:08,015
Bruce.

872
01:05:08,309 --> 01:05:09,472
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

873
01:05:09,644 --> 01:05:11,221
No. Rachel, I know you're his friend, but...

874
01:05:11,396 --> 01:05:13,222
Harvey, trust me.

875
01:05:13,398 --> 01:05:16,149
Bruce's penthouse is now the safest place in the city.

876
01:05:16,317 --> 01:05:17,646
Then you go straight there.

877
01:05:17,819 --> 01:05:19,942
Don 't tell anybody and I'll find you there.

878
01:05:20,113 --> 01:05:21,821
I love you.

879
01:05:35,837 --> 01:05:37,082
I want the Joker.

880
01:05:38,297 --> 01:05:39,957
From one professional to another...

881
01:05:40,133 --> 01:05:42,671
...you're trying to scare somebody, pick a better spot.

882
01:05:42,844 --> 01:05:45,417
From this height, the fall wouldn't kill me.

883
01:05:45,596 --> 01:05:47,174
- I'm counting on it. - huh!

884
01:05:54,564 --> 01:05:57,684
- where is he? - I don't know where he is. he found us.

885
01:05:57,859 --> 01:05:59,139
He must have friends.

886
01:05:59,485 --> 01:06:01,774
Friends? have you met this guy?

887
01:06:01,946 --> 01:06:03,524
Someone knows where he is.

888
01:06:03,698 --> 01:06:06,189
Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.

889
01:06:06,367 --> 01:06:07,696
They're wise to your act.

890
01:06:07,869 --> 01:06:11,866
You got rules. the Joker, he's got no rules.

891
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:16,915
Nobody's gonna cross him for you. if you want this guy, you got one way.

892
01:06:17,086 --> 01:06:18,878
But you already know what that is.

893
01:06:19,047 --> 01:06:21,834
Just take off that mask, let him come find you.

894
01:06:23,468 --> 01:06:25,372
Or you can let a couple more people

895
01:06:25,373 --> 01:06:27,548
Get killed while you make up your mind

896
01:06:29,223 --> 01:06:31,216
You wanna play games?

897
01:06:37,523 --> 01:06:38,555
How's that feel?

898
01:06:38,733 --> 01:06:41,354
- you wouldn't. - I wouldn't!

899
01:06:42,862 --> 01:06:44,487
- you don't think I will? - mm-mm.

900
01:06:44,655 --> 01:06:46,695
- you don't think I will? - mm-mm.

901
01:06:48,076 --> 01:06:51,279
No. no, I wouldn't.

902
01:06:52,497 --> 01:06:55,035
That's why I'm not gonna leave it up to me.

903
01:06:56,042 --> 01:06:59,043
Heads, you get to keep your head.

904
01:06:59,462 --> 01:07:01,087
Tails...

905
01:07:02,048 --> 01:07:03,079
...not so lucky.

906
01:07:03,466 --> 01:07:07,001
So you wanna tell me about the Joker?

907
01:07:16,396 --> 01:07:20,096
- let's go again. - I don't know anything! god, don't!

908
01:07:20,274 --> 01:07:22,647
You're not playing the odds, friend.

909
01:07:23,778 --> 01:07:25,771
Let's do it again.

910
01:07:28,616 --> 01:07:30,443
You'd leave a man's life to chance?

911
01:07:31,202 --> 01:07:34,785
- not exactly. - his name's Schiff, Thomas.

912
01:07:34,956 --> 01:07:37,957
He's a paranoid schizophrenic, former patient at Arkham.

913
01:07:38,126 --> 01:07:42,752
The kind of mind the Joker attracts. what do you expect to learn from him?

914
01:07:46,092 --> 01:07:48,879
The Joker killed Gordon. he's gonna kill Rachel.

915
01:07:49,053 --> 01:07:51,840
You're the symbol of hope I could never be.

916
01:07:52,015 --> 01:07:53,841
Your stand against organized crime...

917
01:07:54,017 --> 01:07:57,220
...is the first legitimate ray of light in Gotham in decades.

918
01:07:57,395 --> 01:08:01,013
If anyone saw this, everything would be undone.

919
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:03,479
The criminals you arrested would be released...

920
01:08:03,651 --> 01:08:06,735
...and Jim Gordon will have died for nothing.

921
01:08:07,363 --> 01:08:09,605
You're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow.

922
01:08:09,782 --> 01:08:12,154
- why? - no one else will die because of me.

923
01:08:12,326 --> 01:08:14,652
Gotham's in your hands now.

924
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:16,537
You can't.

925
01:08:16,706 --> 01:08:18,081
You can't give in.

926
01:08:18,374 --> 01:08:20,912
You can't give in!

927
01:08:36,267 --> 01:08:37,512
Harvey called.

928
01:08:37,685 --> 01:08:40,722
He said batman's gonna turn himself in.

929
01:08:40,897 --> 01:08:42,011
I have no choice.

930
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:45,274
You honestly think that's gonna keep the Joker from killing people?

931
01:08:45,443 --> 01:08:48,894
Maybe not. but I have enough blood on my hands.

932
01:08:49,364 --> 01:08:54,191
And I've seen now what I would have to become to stop men like him.

933
01:08:54,744 --> 01:08:58,195
You once told me that if the day came when I was finished...

934
01:08:58,373 --> 01:09:00,449
...that we'd be together.

935
01:09:01,167 --> 01:09:04,334
Bruce, don't make me your one hope for a normal life.

936
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,208
Did you mean it?

937
01:09:08,716 --> 01:09:10,543
Yes.

938
01:09:27,819 --> 01:09:29,610
Bruce.

939
01:09:30,571 --> 01:09:34,486
If you turn yourself in, they're not gonna let us be together.

940
01:09:45,128 --> 01:09:48,082
Logs as well? everything.

941
01:09:48,256 --> 01:09:51,625
Anything that could lead back to Lucius or Rachel.

942
01:09:56,973 --> 01:10:00,258
People are dying, Alfred. what would you have me do?

943
01:10:00,435 --> 01:10:04,183
Endure, master Wayne. take it.

944
01:10:04,355 --> 01:10:08,056
They'll hate you for it, but that's the point of batman.

945
01:10:08,234 --> 01:10:13,774
He can be the outcast. he can make the choice that no one else can make.

946
01:10:13,948 --> 01:10:15,277
The right choice.

947
01:10:15,783 --> 01:10:18,820
No, today I found out what batman can't do.

948
01:10:18,995 --> 01:10:20,240
He can't endure this.

949
01:10:20,538 --> 01:10:23,409
Today you get to say "i told you so."

950
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,167
Today, I don't want to.

951
01:10:33,009 --> 01:10:34,468
But I did bloody tell you.

952
01:10:37,513 --> 01:10:40,514
I suppose they're gonna lock me up as well...

953
01:10:41,309 --> 01:10:42,554
...as your accomplice.

954
01:10:42,727 --> 01:10:47,472
Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.

955
01:10:51,736 --> 01:10:55,271
Ladies and gentlemen, I've called this press conference for two reasons.

956
01:10:55,448 --> 01:10:57,487
Firstly, to assure the citizens of Gotham...

957
01:10:57,658 --> 01:11:01,324
...that everything that can be done over the Joker killings is being done.

958
01:11:02,705 --> 01:11:05,790
Secondly, because the batman has offered to turn himself in.

959
01:11:05,958 --> 01:11:07,666
But let's consider the situation.

960
01:11:08,044 --> 01:11:10,665
Should we give in to this terrorist's demands?

961
01:11:10,838 --> 01:11:12,297
Do we really think he's gonna...?

962
01:11:12,465 --> 01:11:15,834
You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante than the lives of citizens?

963
01:11:16,010 --> 01:11:18,382
The batman is an outlaw.

964
01:11:19,263 --> 01:11:21,173
That's not why we demand he turn himself in...

965
01:11:21,349 --> 01:11:23,009
...we're doing it because we're scared.

966
01:11:23,184 --> 01:11:25,971
We've been happy to let batman clean up our streets till now.

967
01:11:26,145 --> 01:11:29,099
Things are worse than ever! amen.

968
01:11:30,441 --> 01:11:32,350
Yes, they are.

969
01:11:34,862 --> 01:11:37,863
But the night is darkest just before the dawn.

970
01:11:40,326 --> 01:11:42,402
And I promise you...

971
01:11:43,204 --> 01:11:44,615
...the dawn is coming.

972
01:11:44,789 --> 01:11:46,652
One day, the batman will have to

973
01:11:46,653 --> 01:11:49,332
Answer for the laws he's broken. but to us..

974
01:11:49,502 --> 01:11:51,245
...not to this madman.

975
01:11:51,421 --> 01:11:53,746
- no more dead cops! yeah!

976
01:11:57,051 --> 01:11:58,629
He should turn himself in!

977
01:11:58,803 --> 01:12:01,508
Give us the batman! come on! where is he?

978
01:12:04,392 --> 01:12:06,550
So be it. take the batman into custody.

979
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:08,977
What? is he here?

980
01:12:09,689 --> 01:12:10,720
I am the batman.

981
01:12:11,065 --> 01:12:14,066
What? come on.

982
01:12:22,452 --> 01:12:24,361
Alfred.

983
01:12:25,705 --> 01:12:27,496
Why is he letting Harvey do this?

984
01:12:27,665 --> 01:12:30,666
- he went down to the press conference. - I know. he just stood by.

985
01:12:30,835 --> 01:12:32,911
Perhaps both Bruce and mr. Dent...

986
01:12:33,087 --> 01:12:36,088
...believe that batman stands for something more important...

987
01:12:36,257 --> 01:12:38,582
...than the whims of a terrorist, miss Dawes...

988
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,752
...even if everyone hates him for it.

989
01:12:40,928 --> 01:12:43,051
That's the sacrifice he's making.

990
01:12:43,222 --> 01:12:46,841
He's not being a hero. he's being something more.

991
01:12:47,393 --> 01:12:49,018
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

992
01:12:49,187 --> 01:12:52,271
Letting Harvey take the fall for this is not heroic at all.

993
01:12:54,942 --> 01:12:56,567
You know him better than anyone.

994
01:12:56,986 --> 01:12:58,017
I do.

995
01:13:01,407 --> 01:13:04,444
Will you give this to him for me? when the time is right?

996
01:13:05,912 --> 01:13:07,110
How will I know?

997
01:13:07,288 --> 01:13:08,782
It's not sealed.

998
01:13:10,208 --> 01:13:11,750
Goodbye, Alfred.

999
01:13:15,922 --> 01:13:17,665
Bye, Rachel.

1000
01:13:25,556 --> 01:13:27,383
I didn't have time to talk this through.

1001
01:13:27,558 --> 01:13:28,803
What are you doing?

1002
01:13:28,976 --> 01:13:31,053
They're transferring me to central holding.

1003
01:13:31,354 --> 01:13:32,606
This is the Joker's chance,

1004
01:13:32,607 --> 01:13:35,019
And when he attacks, the batman will take him down

1005
01:13:35,191 --> 01:13:36,733
Listen. this is too dangerous.

1006
01:13:36,901 --> 01:13:38,150
We get this guy to county,

1007
01:13:38,151 --> 01:13:40,602
He's their problem. the streets will be cleared..

1008
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:44,481
...so let's go. the convoys stop for no reason.

1009
01:13:44,659 --> 01:13:46,118
I hope you got some moves, pal.

1010
01:13:46,285 --> 01:13:49,203
He's using you as bait. he doesn't know if he can get the Joker.

1011
01:13:49,372 --> 01:13:50,451
He's failed so far.

1012
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:52,332
How do you know what he's thinking?

1013
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,825
I just do. anyway, this isn't just about you.

1014
01:13:55,003 --> 01:13:56,829
What about the people depending on you...

1015
01:13:57,005 --> 01:14:00,005
...to clean the city up and do it honorably and...?

1016
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,301
Harvey. tell everyone the truth.

1017
01:14:08,683 --> 01:14:10,557
Heads, I go through with it.

1018
01:14:10,768 --> 01:14:12,677
This is your life. you can't leave...

1019
01:14:12,854 --> 01:14:15,226
...something like that to chance. - I'm not.

1020
01:14:19,569 --> 01:14:21,976
You make your own luck.

1021
01:14:43,801 --> 01:14:45,794
Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal.

1022
01:14:53,436 --> 01:14:55,761
What the hell is that?

1023
01:14:55,938 --> 01:14:58,145
Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!

1024
01:14:58,316 --> 01:15:01,519
Damn it! all units divert down onto lower fifth. I repeat, exit down.

1025
01:15:01,944 --> 01:15:03,059
Exit down!

1026
01:15:03,237 --> 01:15:05,563
Lower fifth? we'll be like turkeys on thanksgiving.

1027
01:15:38,272 --> 01:15:40,598
Jesus. come on, get us out of here. let's go.

1028
01:15:42,777 --> 01:15:45,149
Listen, we need backup. we've got company.

1029
01:15:45,321 --> 01:15:46,863
We got trouble, guys.

1030
01:15:49,784 --> 01:15:50,863
Lock and load!

1031
01:16:02,088 --> 01:16:03,463
The hell was that?

1032
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:27,989
- these are built for that, right? - he'll need something...

1033
01:16:28,156 --> 01:16:29,947
...a lot bigger to get through this.

1034
01:16:30,992 --> 01:16:32,451
What is that?

1035
01:16:33,786 --> 01:16:35,115
What is that, a bazooka?

1036
01:16:43,755 --> 01:16:45,463
I didn't sign up for this!

1037
01:17:01,814 --> 01:17:03,143
Look out.

1038
01:17:03,941 --> 01:17:05,104
Look out!

1039
01:17:27,382 --> 01:17:28,496
Come on, let's go!

1040
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:17,506
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent.

1041
01:18:17,677 --> 01:18:20,512
Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive.

1042
01:18:25,435 --> 01:18:29,017
Scanning all systems. scanning all systems.

1043
01:18:36,487 --> 01:18:38,610
We gotta get topside. we need air support, now!

1044
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,994
I like this job. I like it.

1045
01:18:48,249 --> 01:18:50,870
Damage catastrophic. eject sequence initiated.

1046
01:19:04,849 --> 01:19:06,343
Goodbye.

1047
01:19:15,443 --> 01:19:18,646
We're on point, ready to give them some of their own medicine.

1048
01:19:25,036 --> 01:19:27,491
That's what I'm talking about. air cav.

1049
01:19:41,052 --> 01:19:42,760
Okay, rack them up.

1050
01:19:42,929 --> 01:19:45,301
Rack them up, rack them up, rack them up.

1051
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,203
That's not good.

1052
01:20:15,712 --> 01:20:16,910
Okay, that's not good!

1053
01:21:00,048 --> 01:21:02,124
Now, there's a batman.

1054
01:21:06,429 --> 01:21:07,627
Ooh, you wanna play. come on.

1055
01:21:10,558 --> 01:21:11,673
Come on.

1056
01:21:20,818 --> 01:21:22,063
He missed!

1057
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,408
You can't stop here. we're like sitting ducks!

1058
01:21:55,436 --> 01:21:56,516
Come on, come on.

1059
01:21:59,649 --> 01:22:03,018
Come on. come on. I want you to do it, I want you to do it. come on!

1060
01:22:05,571 --> 01:22:07,030
Come on.

1061
01:22:07,699 --> 01:22:11,032
Come on. I want you to do it, I want you to do it. come on, hit me.

1062
01:22:11,202 --> 01:22:12,827
Come on, hit me. come on, hit me!

1063
01:22:14,956 --> 01:22:15,987
Hit me!

1064
01:22:44,402 --> 01:22:46,644
Could you please just give me a minute?

1065
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:50,566
We got you, you son of a bitch.

1066
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:57,784
Gor... you do like to play things pretty close to the chest.

1067
01:22:58,249 --> 01:22:59,957
We got him, Harvey.

1068
01:23:00,126 --> 01:23:03,577
Mr. Dent! how does it feel to be the biggest hero in Gotham?

1069
01:23:03,755 --> 01:23:07,040
No, I'm no hero. Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.

1070
01:23:07,216 --> 01:23:08,545
But you and your office...

1071
01:23:08,718 --> 01:23:10,378
...have been working with the batman all along.

1072
01:23:10,553 --> 01:23:12,344
No, but I trusted him to do the right thing.

1073
01:23:12,513 --> 01:23:14,589
Which was? - saving my ass.

1074
01:23:14,766 --> 01:23:17,683
All right, people, that's enough. let him be. let him be.

1075
01:23:17,852 --> 01:23:19,761
Thank you, detective.

1076
01:23:19,979 --> 01:23:22,102
I've got a date with a pretty upset girlfriend.

1077
01:23:22,273 --> 01:23:24,645
- I figured, counselor. mr. Dent, sir...

1078
01:23:24,817 --> 01:23:28,945
...how about one for the front page, sir? mr. Dent.

1079
01:23:40,291 --> 01:23:43,458
Stand away! all of you!

1080
01:23:43,628 --> 01:23:47,127
I don't want anything for his mob lawyer to use, you understand?

1081
01:23:49,384 --> 01:23:51,257
Back from the dead.

1082
01:23:51,928 --> 01:23:53,470
I, uh...

1083
01:23:53,638 --> 01:23:55,547
...couldn't risk my family's safety.

1084
01:23:56,849 --> 01:23:58,676
What do we got?

1085
01:24:00,353 --> 01:24:04,303
Nothing. no matches on prints, dna, Dental.

1086
01:24:04,482 --> 01:24:07,234
Clothing is custom, no labels.

1087
01:24:07,443 --> 01:24:09,566
Nothing in his pockets but knives and lint.

1088
01:24:09,737 --> 01:24:11,646
No name.

1089
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:13,947
- no other alias. go home, Gordon.

1090
01:24:14,117 --> 01:24:17,201
The clown'll keep till morning. go get some rest.

1091
01:24:17,370 --> 01:24:19,197
You're gonna need it.

1092
01:24:19,455 --> 01:24:22,029
Tomorrow you take the big job.

1093
01:24:22,709 --> 01:24:25,875
You don't have any say in the matter. commissioner Gordon.

1094
01:24:41,728 --> 01:24:43,851
I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety.

1095
01:24:50,361 --> 01:24:51,772
Look at these ugly bastards.

1096
01:24:51,946 --> 01:24:53,820
- I don't feel good. you're a cop killer.

1097
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:56,315
You're lucky to be feeling anything below the neck.

1098
01:24:56,492 --> 01:24:58,070
- please! - step away from the bars!

1099
01:24:58,244 --> 01:25:00,403
My insides hurt.

1100
01:25:14,594 --> 01:25:16,385
Did batman save you, daddy?

1101
01:25:18,556 --> 01:25:20,845
Actually, this time...

1102
01:25:21,017 --> 01:25:23,175
...i saved him.

1103
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:36,155
Has he said anything yet?

1104
01:25:43,748 --> 01:25:47,959
Evening, commissioner.

1105
01:25:55,593 --> 01:25:57,800
Harvey Dent never made it home.

1106
01:25:57,971 --> 01:26:00,093
- of course not. - what have you done with him?

1107
01:26:01,015 --> 01:26:02,759
Me?

1108
01:26:04,394 --> 01:26:06,517
I was right here.

1109
01:26:07,939 --> 01:26:09,766
Who did you leave him with?

1110
01:26:09,941 --> 01:26:12,776
Hm? your people?

1111
01:26:13,903 --> 01:26:17,237
Assuming, of course, that they are still your people...

1112
01:26:17,407 --> 01:26:20,111
...and not Maroni's.

1113
01:26:22,328 --> 01:26:24,700
Does it depress you, commissioner...

1114
01:26:25,123 --> 01:26:30,081
...to know just how alone you really are?

1115
01:26:32,088 --> 01:26:36,964
Does it make you feel responsible for Harvey Dent's current predicament?

1116
01:26:37,135 --> 01:26:39,804
- where is he? - what's the time?

1117
01:26:40,305 --> 01:26:41,799
What difference does that make?

1118
01:26:42,056 --> 01:26:47,513
Well, depending on the time, he may be in one spot or several.

1119
01:26:53,901 --> 01:26:56,855
- lf we're gonna play games... - mm-hm?

1120
01:27:00,033 --> 01:27:01,990
...i'm gonna need a cup of coffee.

1121
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:06,240
Ah, the "good cop, bad cop" routine?

1122
01:27:06,914 --> 01:27:07,946
Not exactly.

1123
01:27:18,468 --> 01:27:19,799
Never start with the head.

1124
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:22,512
The victim gets all fuzzy. he can't feel the next..

1125
01:27:25,683 --> 01:27:26,798
See?

1126
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:29,301
You wanted me. here I am.

1127
01:27:30,355 --> 01:27:32,478
I wanted to see what you'd do.

1128
01:27:33,024 --> 01:27:35,597
And you didn't disappoint.

1129
01:27:35,777 --> 01:27:38,612
You let five people die.

1130
01:27:39,572 --> 01:27:43,237
Then you let Dent take your place.

1131
01:27:43,409 --> 01:27:46,031
- even to a guy like me, that's cold. - where's Dent?

1132
01:27:46,204 --> 01:27:50,996
Those mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were.

1133
01:27:51,501 --> 01:27:56,246
But I know the truth. there's no going back. you've changed things.

1134
01:27:56,422 --> 01:27:58,830
- forever. - then why do you wanna kill me?

1135
01:28:01,803 --> 01:28:03,213
I don't wanna kill you.

1136
01:28:03,721 --> 01:28:08,264
What would I do without you? go back to ripping off mob dealers? no, no.

1137
01:28:08,434 --> 01:28:10,806
No. no, you...

1138
01:28:10,979 --> 01:28:13,386
You complete me.

1139
01:28:13,564 --> 01:28:15,566
- you're garbage who kills for money.

1140
01:28:15,567 --> 01:28:17,894
- don't talk like one of them. you're not

1141
01:28:18,069 --> 01:28:20,477
Even if you'd like to be.

1142
01:28:21,739 --> 01:28:23,566
To them, you're just a freak...

1143
01:28:24,492 --> 01:28:25,820
...like me.

1144
01:28:25,994 --> 01:28:28,282
They need you right now...

1145
01:28:28,871 --> 01:28:30,911
...but when they don't...

1146
01:28:31,457 --> 01:28:34,494
...they'll cast you out like a leper.

1147
01:28:34,669 --> 01:28:38,583
You see, their morals, their code...

1148
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:40,998
...it's a bad joke.

1149
01:28:41,259 --> 01:28:44,592
Dropped at the first sign of trouble.

1150
01:28:45,263 --> 01:28:49,261
They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show you.

1151
01:28:49,434 --> 01:28:52,600
When the chips are down, these...

1152
01:28:52,770 --> 01:28:55,012
These civilized people...

1153
01:28:55,189 --> 01:28:57,265
...they'll eat each other.

1154
01:28:57,984 --> 01:29:00,356
See, I'm not a monster.

1155
01:29:01,738 --> 01:29:03,018
I'm just ahead of the curve.

1156
01:29:05,283 --> 01:29:06,362
Where's Dent?

1157
01:29:06,534 --> 01:29:09,452
You have all these rules, and you think they'll save you.

1158
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:14,948
- he's in control. - I have one rule.

1159
01:29:15,126 --> 01:29:18,210
Oh. then that's the rule you'll have to break to know the truth.

1160
01:29:18,379 --> 01:29:19,542
Which is?

1161
01:29:19,714 --> 01:29:22,122
The only sensible way to live is without rules.

1162
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:24,969
And tonight you're gonna break your one rule.

1163
01:29:25,136 --> 01:29:26,167
I'm considering it.

1164
01:29:26,346 --> 01:29:28,967
There's only minutes left, so you'll have to play my game...

1165
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:31,713
...if you wanna save one of them.

1166
01:29:32,226 --> 01:29:33,258
"them"?

1167
01:29:33,436 --> 01:29:37,481
You know, for a while there, I thought you really were Dent.

1168
01:29:37,649 --> 01:29:40,270
The way you threw yourself after her.

1169
01:29:46,574 --> 01:29:47,653
Look at you go.

1170
01:29:53,289 --> 01:29:56,872
Does Harvey know about you and his little bunny?

1171
01:29:57,794 --> 01:29:59,169
Where are they?!

1172
01:29:59,337 --> 01:30:01,329
Killing is making a choice.

1173
01:30:01,506 --> 01:30:04,590
- where are they?! - choose between one life or the other.

1174
01:30:05,343 --> 01:30:09,590
Your friend the district attorney, or his blushing bride-to-be.

1175
01:30:14,769 --> 01:30:18,849
You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with.

1176
01:30:19,273 --> 01:30:22,773
Nothing to do with all your strength.

1177
01:30:22,986 --> 01:30:26,401
Don't worry, I'm gonna tell you where they are, both of them.

1178
01:30:26,572 --> 01:30:29,609
And that's the point. you'll have to choose.

1179
01:30:30,368 --> 01:30:33,203
He's at 25052nd street...

1180
01:30:33,371 --> 01:30:36,704
...and she's on avenue x at cicero.

1181
01:30:38,793 --> 01:30:40,536
- which one you going after? - Rachel.

1182
01:30:41,963 --> 01:30:43,374
We're getting Dent!

1183
01:30:45,633 --> 01:30:48,468
25052nd street!

1184
01:30:51,389 --> 01:30:53,216
Hello?

1185
01:30:54,183 --> 01:30:56,556
Can anybody hear me?

1186
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:01,601
Hello!

1187
01:31:05,611 --> 01:31:07,853
- Rachel? - Harvey.

1188
01:31:08,031 --> 01:31:10,237
Oh, Harvey, thank god. are you okay?

1189
01:31:10,408 --> 01:31:11,986
I'm all right. I'm in a...

1190
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:15,742
I'm in a warehouse.They got me wired to these oil drums.

1191
01:31:16,789 --> 01:31:17,987
I am too.

1192
01:31:18,541 --> 01:31:20,249
Harvey.

1193
01:31:27,508 --> 01:31:29,964
I want my phone call.

1194
01:31:30,136 --> 01:31:32,923
I want it. I want it.I want my phone call.

1195
01:31:33,598 --> 01:31:35,425
That's nice.

1196
01:31:36,934 --> 01:31:41,762
How many of your friends have I killed?

1197
01:31:45,526 --> 01:31:46,606
I'm a 20-year man...

1198
01:31:46,778 --> 01:31:50,229
...and I know the difference between punks who need a lesson in manners...

1199
01:31:50,406 --> 01:31:53,277
...and the freaks like you who would just enjoy it.

1200
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:56,616
And you killed six of my friends.

1201
01:31:56,788 --> 01:31:57,819
Six?

1202
01:31:57,997 --> 01:32:00,453
Please. My insides hurt.

1203
01:32:00,625 --> 01:32:02,368
I don't really care. Back away.

1204
01:32:02,543 --> 01:32:05,710
The boss said he'd make the voices go away.

1205
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:09,415
He said he'd go inside and replace them with bright lights...

1206
01:32:09,592 --> 01:32:10,707
...like Christmas.

1207
01:32:10,885 --> 01:32:13,423
You're out of your mind, pal. Back off.

1208
01:32:13,596 --> 01:32:16,431
Medic to the holding tank.Come on. Get the door open.

1209
01:32:16,641 --> 01:32:17,803
You guys, back off!

1210
01:32:17,976 --> 01:32:20,134
Listen, we don't have a lot of time.

1211
01:32:20,311 --> 01:32:24,309
They told me that only one of us was gonna make it...

1212
01:32:24,482 --> 01:32:27,816
...and that they were gonna let our friends choose.

1213
01:32:30,530 --> 01:32:32,653
Okay, Rachel.

1214
01:32:33,241 --> 01:32:36,361
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be all right.They're coming for you.

1215
01:32:36,536 --> 01:32:40,830
Listen to me. I'll help you. Just talk me through what's going on with you.

1216
01:32:40,999 --> 01:32:42,908
Can you find something,anything, sharp?

1217
01:32:43,084 --> 01:32:44,495
I'm trying.

1218
01:32:44,669 --> 01:32:46,827
- What's...?- Shit.

1219
01:32:47,005 --> 01:32:48,499
Harvey?

1220
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:53,920
Harvey, what's happening?

1221
01:33:03,271 --> 01:33:07,103
All available units,converge at 25052nd Street.

1222
01:33:07,442 --> 01:33:11,522
Do you wanna know why I use a knife?

1223
01:33:13,823 --> 01:33:15,151
Guns are too quick.

1224
01:33:15,325 --> 01:33:18,694
You can't savor all the...

1225
01:33:18,870 --> 01:33:22,203
...little emotions.

1226
01:33:24,125 --> 01:33:29,001
You see, in their last moments...

1227
01:33:29,172 --> 01:33:31,460
...people show you who they really are.

1228
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:38,220
So in a way, I knew your friends better than you ever did.

1229
01:33:41,976 --> 01:33:45,392
Would you like to know which of them were cowards?

1230
01:33:51,903 --> 01:33:53,563
What's that?Jeez.

1231
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:55,819
He's got some kind of a...

1232
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:59,193
...contusion.- I know you're gonna enjoy this.

1233
01:34:00,578 --> 01:34:04,327
I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it even more.

1234
01:34:11,881 --> 01:34:12,912
Just put it down.

1235
01:34:13,091 --> 01:34:15,878
Take it easy. Take it easy.Drop the weapon now!

1236
01:34:16,052 --> 01:34:20,002
- It's my own damn fault, just shoot him!- Let him go now! Drop it!

1237
01:34:20,306 --> 01:34:23,307
- What? Sorry?- What do you want?

1238
01:34:24,352 --> 01:34:26,261
I just want my phone call.

1239
01:34:29,273 --> 01:34:31,943
What...? What...? What's happening?

1240
01:34:32,110 --> 01:34:34,945
Just talk to me, just for one second.

1241
01:34:37,281 --> 01:34:39,951
- All right?- Right.

1242
01:34:51,754 --> 01:34:53,794
Is that a phone?

1243
01:35:03,474 --> 01:35:04,803
Mount the curb!

1244
01:35:12,817 --> 01:35:16,815
Harvey, just in case,I wanna tell you something, okay?

1245
01:35:16,988 --> 01:35:18,779
Don 't think like that. They're coming.

1246
01:35:18,948 --> 01:35:21,237
I know they are,but I don't want them to.

1247
01:35:25,663 --> 01:35:29,743
I don't wanna live without you,and I do have an answer for you.

1248
01:35:30,168 --> 01:35:31,911
My answer is yes.

1249
01:35:34,672 --> 01:35:37,424
No! No! No!

1250
01:35:37,592 --> 01:35:40,213
Not me! Why are you coming for me?

1251
01:35:40,386 --> 01:35:41,417
No!

1252
01:35:43,097 --> 01:35:44,675
Rachel! Rachel!

1253
01:35:44,891 --> 01:35:47,216
- Harvey.- No! No! Rachel!

1254
01:35:47,393 --> 01:35:48,425
Okay.

1255
01:35:48,603 --> 01:35:49,682
Rachel!

1256
01:35:50,104 --> 01:35:51,646
No! No!

1257
01:35:51,814 --> 01:35:55,942
Harvey, it's okay. It's all right. Listen.

1258
01:35:56,110 --> 01:35:57,439
Somewh...

1259
01:36:03,326 --> 01:36:04,524
No, commissioner!

1260
01:36:04,702 --> 01:36:07,372
Rachel! No!

1261
01:36:21,719 --> 01:36:22,834
Hello there.

1262
01:36:28,726 --> 01:36:32,226
Back at the MCU, the Joker's gone.

1263
01:36:33,147 --> 01:36:34,855
With Lau?

1264
01:36:37,652 --> 01:36:40,225
The Joker planned to be caught.

1265
01:36:40,571 --> 01:36:42,730
He wanted me to lock him up in the MCU.

1266
01:37:02,385 --> 01:37:04,424
Dear Bruce:

1267
01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:08,718
I need to be honest and clear.

1268
01:37:10,768 --> 01:37:13,306
I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.

1269
01:37:13,479 --> 01:37:17,394
I love him, and I wanna spend the rest of my life with him.

1270
01:37:17,942 --> 01:37:22,355
When I told you that if Gotham no longer needed Batman, we could be together...

1271
01:37:22,530 --> 01:37:24,736
... I meant it.

1272
01:37:24,991 --> 01:37:29,736
But now I'm sure the day won 't come when you no longer need Batman.

1273
01:37:30,788 --> 01:37:32,698
I hope it does.

1274
01:37:32,874 --> 01:37:35,625
And if it does, I will be there...

1275
01:37:36,169 --> 01:37:37,579
... but as your friend.

1276
01:37:38,296 --> 01:37:40,538
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1277
01:37:40,715 --> 01:37:43,087
I'm sorry to let you down.

1278
01:37:43,259 --> 01:37:48,254
If you lose your faith in me,please keep your faith in people.

1279
01:37:48,848 --> 01:37:53,261
Love, now and always, Rachel.

1280
01:38:01,235 --> 01:38:03,561
Prepared a little breakfast.

1281
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:09,609
- Very well, then.- Alfred.

1282
01:38:09,786 --> 01:38:10,948
Yes, Master Wayne?

1283
01:38:12,330 --> 01:38:14,572
Did I bring this on her?

1284
01:38:15,625 --> 01:38:17,831
I was meant to inspire good...

1285
01:38:18,002 --> 01:38:20,374
...not madness, not death.

1286
01:38:20,546 --> 01:38:25,173
You have inspired good. But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals.

1287
01:38:25,343 --> 01:38:27,419
Didn't you think there might be casualties?

1288
01:38:27,595 --> 01:38:30,003
Things always get worse before they get better.

1289
01:38:30,348 --> 01:38:31,807
But Rachel, Alfred.

1290
01:38:31,975 --> 01:38:35,759
Rachel believed in what you stood for...

1291
01:38:35,937 --> 01:38:37,846
...what we stand for.

1292
01:38:38,022 --> 01:38:39,481
Gotham needs you.

1293
01:38:40,024 --> 01:38:42,978
No, Gotham needs its true hero...

1294
01:38:43,486 --> 01:38:47,614
...and I let that murdering psychopath blow him half to hell.

1295
01:38:47,782 --> 01:38:50,107
Which is why, for now...

1296
01:38:50,910 --> 01:38:52,819
...they're gonna have to make do with you.

1297
01:38:55,039 --> 01:38:56,866
She was gonna wait for me, Alfred.

1298
01:38:58,876 --> 01:39:00,916
Dent doesn't know.

1299
01:39:01,087 --> 01:39:02,367
He can never know.

1300
01:39:04,799 --> 01:39:06,424
What's that?

1301
01:39:06,592 --> 01:39:09,546
- it can wait. - that bandit...

1302
01:39:10,013 --> 01:39:12,136
...in the forest in burma.

1303
01:39:12,307 --> 01:39:14,346
- did you catch him? - yes.

1304
01:39:14,517 --> 01:39:15,845
How?

1305
01:39:17,270 --> 01:39:18,894
We burned the forest down.

1306
01:39:58,144 --> 01:40:00,765
He's credible, an m & a lawyer from a leading consultancy.

1307
01:40:00,938 --> 01:40:04,307
He says he's waited as long as he can for batman to do the right thing.

1308
01:40:04,484 --> 01:40:06,560
Now he's taking matters into his own hands.

1309
01:40:06,736 --> 01:40:09,690
We'll be live at 5 with the true identity of the batman.

1310
01:40:26,130 --> 01:40:27,755
I'm sorry about Rachel.

1311
01:40:30,468 --> 01:40:32,607
The doctor says you're in agonizing

1312
01:40:32,608 --> 01:40:35,296
Pain, but that you won't accept medication

1313
01:40:36,349 --> 01:40:38,306
That you're refusing to...

1314
01:40:38,476 --> 01:40:40,219
...accept skin grafts.

1315
01:40:40,561 --> 01:40:42,803
Remember that name...

1316
01:40:43,398 --> 01:40:45,723
...you all had for me...

1317
01:40:46,192 --> 01:40:49,027
...when I was at internal affairs?

1318
01:40:51,489 --> 01:40:52,769
What was it, Gordon?

1319
01:40:53,449 --> 01:40:54,825
Harvey, i...

1320
01:40:54,993 --> 01:40:56,487
Say it.

1321
01:40:57,912 --> 01:40:59,821
Say it!

1322
01:41:07,505 --> 01:41:10,589
Two-face. Harvey two-face.

1323
01:41:12,176 --> 01:41:16,470
Why should I hide who I am?

1324
01:41:17,682 --> 01:41:19,010
I know you tried to warn me.

1325
01:41:19,892 --> 01:41:21,090
I'm sorry.

1326
01:41:21,728 --> 01:41:24,349
Wuertz picked you up. was he working for them?

1327
01:41:26,649 --> 01:41:29,021
Do you know who picked up Rachel?

1328
01:41:29,861 --> 01:41:32,862
Harvey, I need to know which of my men I can trust.

1329
01:41:33,239 --> 01:41:35,362
Why would you listen to me now?

1330
01:41:36,492 --> 01:41:38,152
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1331
01:41:40,705 --> 01:41:42,496
No.

1332
01:41:42,957 --> 01:41:45,080
No, you're not.

1333
01:41:46,127 --> 01:41:47,372
Not yet.

1334
01:41:52,634 --> 01:41:55,338
This craziness, it's too much.

1335
01:41:55,553 --> 01:41:58,803
Should've thought about that before you let the clown out of the box.

1336
01:41:58,973 --> 01:42:00,717
You want him?

1337
01:42:03,186 --> 01:42:05,511
I can tell you where he'll be this afternoon.

1338
01:42:13,571 --> 01:42:15,860
Not so crazy as you look.

1339
01:42:16,032 --> 01:42:19,780
I told you, I'm a man of my word.

1340
01:42:22,997 --> 01:42:24,242
Where is the italian?

1341
01:42:24,415 --> 01:42:27,535
All tactical units will converge on the location in 20 minutes.

1342
01:42:27,710 --> 01:42:31,162
I want auxiliary units to cover all possible getaway routes.

1343
01:42:31,756 --> 01:42:32,919
Please.

1344
01:42:33,091 --> 01:42:36,424
Joker-man, what you do with all your money?

1345
01:42:37,095 --> 01:42:39,764
You see, I'm a guy of simple taste.

1346
01:42:39,931 --> 01:42:41,591
I enjoy...

1347
01:42:41,766 --> 01:42:43,141
...dynamite...

1348
01:42:43,309 --> 01:42:44,851
...and gunpowder...

1349
01:42:45,311 --> 01:42:47,719
...and gasoline.

1350
01:42:49,190 --> 01:42:51,432
- what the...? - ah, ah, ah.

1351
01:42:53,277 --> 01:42:56,113
And you know the thing that they have in common?

1352
01:42:56,614 --> 01:42:57,895
They're cheap.

1353
01:42:58,074 --> 01:43:00,743
How much are they paying you to say who batman is?

1354
01:43:00,910 --> 01:43:04,860
This is our chance. I want Lau alive. the Joker, either way.

1355
01:43:05,039 --> 01:43:06,450
Hey, Jim. get a load of this.

1356
01:43:06,624 --> 01:43:07,953
Let's take the next caller.

1357
01:43:08,126 --> 01:43:10,284
Harvey Dent didn 't wanna give in to this maniac.

1358
01:43:10,461 --> 01:43:11,742
You think you know better?

1359
01:43:11,921 --> 01:43:15,290
I think that if we could talk to Dent today, he may feel differently.

1360
01:43:15,466 --> 01:43:19,546
And we wish him a speedy recovery. because god knows, we need him now.

1361
01:43:19,721 --> 01:43:21,927
You said you were a man of your word.

1362
01:43:22,223 --> 01:43:24,263
Oh, I am.

1363
01:43:25,977 --> 01:43:28,646
I'm only burning my half.

1364
01:43:29,981 --> 01:43:32,104
All you care about is money.

1365
01:43:32,275 --> 01:43:35,726
This town deserves a better class of criminal...

1366
01:43:35,903 --> 01:43:38,145
...and I'm gonna give it to them.

1367
01:43:38,948 --> 01:43:41,439
Tell your men they work for me now.

1368
01:43:41,617 --> 01:43:43,990
This is my city.

1369
01:43:44,662 --> 01:43:47,200
They won't work for a freak.

1370
01:43:47,373 --> 01:43:49,081
"freak."

1371
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:51,706
Why don't we cut you up into little pieces...

1372
01:43:51,878 --> 01:43:53,336
...and feed you to your pooches? hm?

1373
01:43:53,504 --> 01:43:56,375
And then we'll see how loyal a hungry dog really is.

1374
01:43:58,384 --> 01:44:00,709
It's not about money...

1375
01:44:00,887 --> 01:44:04,090
...it's about sending a message.

1376
01:44:04,891 --> 01:44:07,346
Everything Burns.

1377
01:44:09,854 --> 01:44:12,012
- who is this? I had a vision...

1378
01:44:12,190 --> 01:44:14,941
... of a world without batman.

1379
01:44:15,109 --> 01:44:17,351
The mob ground out a little profit...

1380
01:44:17,528 --> 01:44:21,443
... and the police tried to shut them down one block at a time.

1381
01:44:21,616 --> 01:44:24,901
And it was so boring.

1382
01:44:25,078 --> 01:44:27,035
I've had a change of heart.

1383
01:44:27,205 --> 01:44:29,826
I don 't want mr. Reese spoiling everything...

1384
01:44:29,999 --> 01:44:34,708
... but why should I have all the fun? let's give someone else a chance.

1385
01:44:34,879 --> 01:44:39,707
If Coleman Reese isn 't dead in 60 minutes...

1386
01:44:39,884 --> 01:44:41,960
... then I blow up a hospital.

1387
01:44:42,136 --> 01:44:43,714
Call in every officer.

1388
01:44:43,888 --> 01:44:47,222
Tell them to head to their nearest hospital and start evac and search.

1389
01:44:47,392 --> 01:44:49,515
Call the transit authority, school board, prisons.

1390
01:44:49,686 --> 01:44:51,310
Get every bus down to a hospital.

1391
01:44:51,479 --> 01:44:53,347
The priority is Gotham general.

1392
01:44:53,348 --> 01:44:56,058
Wheel everybody out of that place right now

1393
01:44:56,234 --> 01:44:57,894
You, you and you, you come with me.

1394
01:44:58,069 --> 01:44:59,943
- where are we going, sir? - to get Reese.

1395
01:45:00,279 --> 01:45:03,364
I need you plugged in, checking Gordon's men and their families.

1396
01:45:03,533 --> 01:45:05,739
- looking for? - hospital admissions.

1397
01:45:05,910 --> 01:45:07,570
Will you be wanting the batpod?

1398
01:45:07,745 --> 01:45:09,702
In the middle of the day? not very subtle.

1399
01:45:09,872 --> 01:45:11,153
The lamborghini, then.

1400
01:45:12,083 --> 01:45:13,198
Much more subtle.

1401
01:45:27,056 --> 01:45:29,547
Excuse me. let me through. excuse me. okay.

1402
01:45:29,726 --> 01:45:33,225
Sir, could you help, please?

1403
01:45:33,396 --> 01:45:35,104
I'm gonna find a bus for him.

1404
01:45:37,066 --> 01:45:38,940
Sir? commissioner, do you really think...

1405
01:45:39,110 --> 01:45:41,268
...an ordinary citizen would try to kill this man?

1406
01:45:45,783 --> 01:45:48,109
Sir. commissioner.

1407
01:45:50,204 --> 01:45:52,411
Get the cars around the back!

1408
01:45:54,792 --> 01:45:56,121
Go. keep rolling, Sam.

1409
01:46:02,091 --> 01:46:04,048
I see O'brien and Richards.

1410
01:46:04,636 --> 01:46:08,135
No immediate family member admitted to a Gotham hospital.

1411
01:46:09,432 --> 01:46:12,967
They're trying to kill me. - well, maybe batman can save you.

1412
01:46:26,115 --> 01:46:28,737
Davis, they got space. bring him out.

1413
01:46:30,411 --> 01:46:32,203
Davis.

1414
01:46:37,335 --> 01:46:39,660
I saw Burns and Zachary.

1415
01:46:39,837 --> 01:46:41,035
Nothing on them.

1416
01:46:41,214 --> 01:46:42,672
And a patrolman I don't know.

1417
01:46:43,883 --> 01:46:45,792
Okay, so, what now?

1418
01:46:46,678 --> 01:46:48,919
What do we do now? where are we going?

1419
01:46:51,683 --> 01:46:53,343
Send the information to Gordon.

1420
01:47:01,234 --> 01:47:02,776
Get out of here.

1421
01:47:04,821 --> 01:47:06,612
Davis.

1422
01:47:09,784 --> 01:47:12,192
Ma'am, we're gonna have to move him now.

1423
01:47:23,881 --> 01:47:26,207
It's Berg, isn't it? - commissioner.

1424
01:47:27,343 --> 01:47:28,802
You okay, son?

1425
01:47:53,244 --> 01:47:54,738
You know...

1426
01:47:55,580 --> 01:47:58,664
...i don't want there to be any hard feelings between us, Harvey.

1427
01:47:58,833 --> 01:48:01,953
- when you and... - Rachel!

1428
01:48:02,128 --> 01:48:04,417
- Rachel were being abducted...

1429
01:48:04,589 --> 01:48:07,590
...i was sitting in Gordon's cage.

1430
01:48:07,925 --> 01:48:09,835
I didn't rig those charges.

1431
01:48:10,053 --> 01:48:12,508
Your men, your plan.

1432
01:48:12,722 --> 01:48:15,178
Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

1433
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:18,387
You know what I am? I'm a dog chasing cars.

1434
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:21,475
I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it.

1435
01:48:21,648 --> 01:48:24,767
You know? I just do things.

1436
01:48:25,151 --> 01:48:28,852
The mob has plans. the cops have plans.

1437
01:48:29,030 --> 01:48:31,236
Gordon's got plans.

1438
01:48:31,407 --> 01:48:34,361
You know, they're schemers.

1439
01:48:34,535 --> 01:48:38,284
Schemers trying to control their little worlds.

1440
01:48:38,456 --> 01:48:39,950
I'm not a schemer.

1441
01:48:40,124 --> 01:48:41,749
I try to show the schemers...

1442
01:48:41,918 --> 01:48:47,208
...how pathetic their attempts to control things really are.

1443
01:48:48,174 --> 01:48:51,210
So when I say... ah. come here.

1444
01:48:51,719 --> 01:48:55,254
When I say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal...

1445
01:48:56,808 --> 01:48:59,014
...you'll know that I'm telling the truth.

1446
01:49:01,521 --> 01:49:04,308
- I'm gonna need your weapon. - what?

1447
01:49:08,069 --> 01:49:09,896
Why? because my wife's in the hospital?

1448
01:49:10,613 --> 01:49:12,155
Yeah, that'd be why.

1449
01:49:13,074 --> 01:49:16,277
It's the schemers that put you where you are.

1450
01:49:16,452 --> 01:49:20,236
You were a schemer, you had plans...

1451
01:49:20,415 --> 01:49:22,573
...and look where that got you.

1452
01:49:33,344 --> 01:49:35,716
Police are taking every precaution...

1453
01:49:35,888 --> 01:49:38,011
... urging people not to take matters into their hands.

1454
01:49:38,182 --> 01:49:40,720
I just did what I do best.

1455
01:49:40,893 --> 01:49:44,512
I took your little plan and I turned it on itself.

1456
01:49:44,689 --> 01:49:47,115
Look what I did to this city with a

1457
01:49:47,116 --> 01:49:50,028
Few drums of gas and a couple of bullets

1458
01:49:50,194 --> 01:49:53,480
Hm? you know what I noticed?

1459
01:49:53,656 --> 01:49:57,191
Nobody panics when things go "according to plan."

1460
01:49:57,368 --> 01:49:59,028
Even if the plan is horrifying.

1461
01:49:59,662 --> 01:50:04,704
If tomorrow I tell the press that, like, a gangbanger will get shot...

1462
01:50:04,876 --> 01:50:08,327
...or a truckload of soldiers will be blowing up...

1463
01:50:08,629 --> 01:50:09,709
...nobody panics.

1464
01:50:10,423 --> 01:50:13,507
Because it's all part of the plan.

1465
01:50:13,676 --> 01:50:18,587
But when I say that one little old mayor will die...

1466
01:50:18,848 --> 01:50:21,256
...well, then, everyone loses their minds.

1467
01:50:24,687 --> 01:50:27,605
Introduce a little anarchy...

1468
01:50:28,775 --> 01:50:31,016
...upset the established order...

1469
01:50:31,194 --> 01:50:35,737
...and everything becomes chaos.

1470
01:50:37,575 --> 01:50:40,327
I'm an agent of chaos.

1471
01:50:40,703 --> 01:50:43,028
Oh, and you know the thing about chaos?

1472
01:50:45,083 --> 01:50:46,707
It's fair.

1473
01:50:55,927 --> 01:50:59,094
- you live. - mm-hm.

1474
01:50:59,597 --> 01:51:01,222
You die.

1475
01:51:01,432 --> 01:51:03,425
Mmm. now we're talking.

1476
01:51:12,777 --> 01:51:14,271
Mr. Reese.

1477
01:51:32,463 --> 01:51:34,622
That's mr. Wayne, isn't it?

1478
01:51:34,799 --> 01:51:37,800
- that was a very brave thing you did. - trying to catch the light?

1479
01:51:38,136 --> 01:51:40,971
- you weren't protecting the van? - why? who's in it?

1480
01:51:46,436 --> 01:51:48,512
Don't you think I should go to the hospital?

1481
01:51:48,688 --> 01:51:51,179
Don't watch a whole lot of news, do you, mr. Wayne?

1482
01:52:57,340 --> 01:52:59,167
Southeast.

1483
01:52:59,342 --> 01:53:01,548
It's Gotham general.

1484
01:53:02,303 --> 01:53:03,963
- did you clear the building? yeah.

1485
01:53:06,975 --> 01:53:08,682
You must know how many were inside.

1486
01:53:08,851 --> 01:53:10,227
You have patient lists, roll call.

1487
01:53:10,395 --> 01:53:12,720
Right now we're showing 50 people missing. one bus.

1488
01:53:12,897 --> 01:53:16,064
The other buses were heading off to hospitals. I guess we missed one.

1489
01:53:16,234 --> 01:53:18,357
What's your guess about where Harvey Dent is?

1490
01:53:18,528 --> 01:53:22,988
Keep looking. and keep it to yourself. anybody asks, we got him out.

1491
01:53:25,576 --> 01:53:27,984
Get me the mayor's office on the line.

1492
01:53:29,163 --> 01:53:30,907
We're gonna need the national guard.

1493
01:53:31,082 --> 01:53:32,706
- people are still missing...

1494
01:53:32,875 --> 01:53:34,073
... including gcn's own Mike Engel.

1495
01:53:34,252 --> 01:53:37,502
I'm now being told that we're cutting to a video gcn has just received.

1496
01:53:37,672 --> 01:53:39,581
I'm Mike Engel for Gotham tonight.

1497
01:53:40,091 --> 01:53:43,425
"what does it take to make you people wanna join in?

1498
01:53:43,594 --> 01:53:46,168
You failed to kill the lawyer. I've gotta get you off the bench...

1499
01:53:46,347 --> 01:53:48,091
...and into the game. bench. game.

1500
01:53:50,268 --> 01:53:52,391
Come nightfall, this city is mine. mine.

1501
01:53:52,562 --> 01:53:55,313
- and anyone left here plays by my rules. - rules.

1502
01:53:55,606 --> 01:53:58,940
Mr. Fox? security is showing a break-in at the r & d department.

1503
01:53:59,110 --> 01:54:01,233
If you don 't wanna be in the game...

1504
01:54:01,404 --> 01:54:02,779
...get out now. - get out now.

1505
01:54:04,949 --> 01:54:07,903
But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd are sure in for a surprise.

1506
01:54:43,655 --> 01:54:44,935
Gotham p.d. has shut down...

1507
01:54:45,114 --> 01:54:47,570
Sweet jesus. ...the area 's bridges and tunnels.

1508
01:54:47,742 --> 01:54:51,158
Shouldn't you be out there, you know, doing something?

1509
01:54:51,329 --> 01:54:53,286
It's my day off.

1510
01:54:53,915 --> 01:54:55,492
I gotta take a leak.

1511
01:54:55,667 --> 01:54:57,992
Keep an eye out for me, will you?

1512
01:55:03,591 --> 01:55:05,548
Now what? need someone to shake it for you?

1513
01:55:05,718 --> 01:55:07,296
Hello.

1514
01:55:08,012 --> 01:55:09,506
Dent.

1515
01:55:09,681 --> 01:55:11,887
Jesus. I thought you was dead.

1516
01:55:12,058 --> 01:55:13,718
Half.

1517
01:55:19,774 --> 01:55:21,352
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?

1518
01:55:21,526 --> 01:55:23,518
- it must've been Maroni's men. - shut up!

1519
01:55:25,279 --> 01:55:27,402
Are you telling me that you're gonna protect...

1520
01:55:27,573 --> 01:55:29,317
...the other traitor in Gordon's unit?

1521
01:55:29,492 --> 01:55:30,951
I don't know, he never told me.

1522
01:55:31,119 --> 01:55:32,518
Listen, Dent, I swear to god,

1523
01:55:32,519 --> 01:55:34,737
I didn't know what they were gonna do to you

1524
01:55:36,290 --> 01:55:37,453
That's funny...

1525
01:55:39,210 --> 01:55:41,962
...because I don't know what's gonna happen to you either.

1526
01:55:46,092 --> 01:55:48,001
Beautiful, isn't it?

1527
01:55:48,386 --> 01:55:50,046
Beautiful.

1528
01:55:50,596 --> 01:55:51,711
Unethical.

1529
01:55:52,890 --> 01:55:54,433
Dangerous.

1530
01:55:54,642 --> 01:55:58,142
You've turned every cell phone in Gotham into a microphone.

1531
01:55:58,313 --> 01:56:00,720
And a high-frequency generator-receiver.

1532
01:56:00,898 --> 01:56:05,975
You took my sonar concept and applied it to every phone in the city.

1533
01:56:06,154 --> 01:56:10,732
With half the city feeding you sonar, you can image all of Gotham.

1534
01:56:12,660 --> 01:56:14,036
This is wrong.

1535
01:56:14,203 --> 01:56:16,243
I've gotta find this man, Lucius.

1536
01:56:18,249 --> 01:56:19,530
At what cost?

1537
01:56:19,709 --> 01:56:22,496
The database is null-key encrypted.

1538
01:56:22,670 --> 01:56:24,877
It can only be accessed by one person.

1539
01:56:26,215 --> 01:56:28,374
This is too much power for one person.

1540
01:56:28,551 --> 01:56:30,709
That's why I gave it to you.

1541
01:56:31,179 --> 01:56:32,377
Only you can use it.

1542
01:56:32,555 --> 01:56:36,339
Spying on 30 million people isn't part of my job description.

1543
01:56:38,561 --> 01:56:39,714
This is an audio Sample.

1544
01:56:39,715 --> 01:56:42,262
If he talks within range of any phone in the city..

1545
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:44,646
...you can triangulate his position.

1546
01:56:45,109 --> 01:56:47,600
I'll help you this one time.

1547
01:56:48,071 --> 01:56:49,862
But consider this my resignation.

1548
01:56:50,031 --> 01:56:54,609
As long as this machine is at Wayne enterprises, I won't be.

1549
01:56:55,370 --> 01:56:57,279
When you're finished...

1550
01:56:57,955 --> 01:56:59,070
...type in your name.

1551
01:57:07,674 --> 01:57:10,758
My officers are going over every inch of the tunnels and bridges...

1552
01:57:10,927 --> 01:57:14,130
...but with the Joker's threat, they're not an option.

1553
01:57:14,305 --> 01:57:17,140
- and land routes east? - backed up for hours.

1554
01:57:17,308 --> 01:57:20,926
Which leaves the ferries with 30,000 ready to board.

1555
01:57:21,104 --> 01:57:24,140
I wanna use the ferries so I can get those prisoners off the island.

1556
01:57:24,482 --> 01:57:27,269
The men you put away? those aren't people I'm worried about.

1557
01:57:27,443 --> 01:57:29,566
You should be. whatever the Joker's planning...

1558
01:57:29,737 --> 01:57:31,791
...it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners

1559
01:57:31,792 --> 01:57:34,233
Are involved. I wanna get them out of here

1560
01:57:35,702 --> 01:57:36,900
So where is Harvey?

1561
01:57:37,495 --> 01:57:40,662
- we haven't found him. - oh, jesus.

1562
01:57:44,502 --> 01:57:46,578
How long can you keep this quiet?

1563
01:58:00,685 --> 01:58:03,354
Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.

1564
01:58:04,188 --> 01:58:06,347
Going to join your wife?

1565
01:58:09,861 --> 01:58:12,352
- you love her? - yes.

1566
01:58:13,239 --> 01:58:16,193
You ever imagine what it would be like to listen to her die?

1567
01:58:16,367 --> 01:58:17,861
Look, take it up with the Joker.

1568
01:58:18,036 --> 01:58:21,286
He killed your woman. he made you...

1569
01:58:21,456 --> 01:58:22,487
...like this.

1570
01:58:22,874 --> 01:58:25,875
The Joker's just a mad dog.

1571
01:58:26,044 --> 01:58:28,665
I want whoever let him off the leash.

1572
01:58:29,380 --> 01:58:32,714
I took care of Wuertz, but who was your other man inside Gordon's unit?

1573
01:58:32,884 --> 01:58:35,505
Who picked up Rachel? must have been someone she trusted.

1574
01:58:36,721 --> 01:58:38,844
Look, if I tell you...

1575
01:58:39,015 --> 01:58:40,046
...will you let me go?

1576
01:58:40,808 --> 01:58:42,137
Can't hurt your chances.

1577
01:58:44,896 --> 01:58:46,556
It was Ramirez.

1578
01:58:51,986 --> 01:58:55,236
- but you said... - I said it couldn't hurt your chances.

1579
01:58:58,826 --> 01:59:00,949
You're a lucky man.

1580
01:59:04,415 --> 01:59:06,159
- but he's not. - who?

1581
01:59:09,087 --> 01:59:10,497
Your driver.

1582
01:59:23,726 --> 01:59:24,758
Stand back.

1583
01:59:24,936 --> 01:59:27,261
Hey, that ain't right. we should be on that boat.

1584
01:59:27,438 --> 01:59:30,012
You wanna ride across with them? be my guest.

1585
01:59:53,256 --> 01:59:54,964
Sir, they've stopped their engines.

1586
01:59:55,133 --> 01:59:56,164
Right, get on the radio.

1587
01:59:56,342 --> 01:59:59,960
Tell them we'll come back and pick them up once we dump the scumbags.

1588
02:00:00,138 --> 02:00:02,510
Liberty, this is Spirit. come in.

1589
02:00:04,559 --> 02:00:05,757
What the heck was that?

1590
02:00:07,687 --> 02:00:09,146
What the...?

1591
02:00:09,689 --> 02:00:12,974
Liberty, come in, please. this is Spirit. come in.

1592
02:00:14,610 --> 02:00:16,484
Liberty, we have the Same thing. we've lost both engines.

1593
02:00:16,654 --> 02:00:18,148
- Liberty, come in. Fox.

1594
02:00:18,323 --> 02:00:20,814
There's something going on on the ferries.

1595
02:00:21,576 --> 02:00:23,865
Get down to the engine room now.

1596
02:00:24,495 --> 02:00:26,702
Hey, buddy, what's happening?

1597
02:00:35,298 --> 02:00:38,749
Captain, we got a hundred barrels down there rigged to blow. and this.

1598
02:00:53,107 --> 02:00:54,934
Looks like some kind of detonator.

1599
02:00:55,109 --> 02:00:57,980
Why would they give us the detonator to our own bomb?

1600
02:01:00,907 --> 02:01:02,282
Tonight, you're all gonna...

1601
02:01:02,450 --> 02:01:04,193
... be a part of a social experiment.

1602
02:01:08,039 --> 02:01:11,871
Through the magic of diesel fuel and ammonium nitrate...

1603
02:01:12,043 --> 02:01:16,123
... I'm ready right now to blow you all sky-high.

1604
02:01:16,297 --> 02:01:18,373
Liberty, come in, over.

1605
02:01:19,842 --> 02:01:20,874
It's dead.

1606
02:01:21,219 --> 02:01:25,715
If anyone attempts to get off their boat, you all die.

1607
02:01:26,057 --> 02:01:27,337
I'm zeroing in.

1608
02:01:27,517 --> 02:01:32,060
Each of you has a remote to blow up the other boat.

1609
02:01:32,230 --> 02:01:34,685
His voice is on the ferry...

1610
02:01:34,857 --> 02:01:36,897
...but it's not the source.

1611
02:01:39,153 --> 02:01:40,268
West.

1612
02:01:47,537 --> 02:01:49,825
- Gordon. I have the Joker's location.

1613
02:01:49,998 --> 02:01:51,077
Prewitt building.

1614
02:01:51,249 --> 02:01:53,704
Assemble on the building opposite.

1615
02:01:55,086 --> 02:01:57,873
At midnight, I blow you all up.

1616
02:01:58,047 --> 02:02:03,208
If, however, one of you presses the button, I'll let that boat live.

1617
02:02:03,386 --> 02:02:05,509
So who 's it gonna be?

1618
02:02:05,680 --> 02:02:08,218
Harvey Dent's most-wanted scumbag collection...

1619
02:02:08,391 --> 02:02:11,724
... or the sweet and innocent civilians?

1620
02:02:11,894 --> 02:02:14,432
You choose.

1621
02:02:14,605 --> 02:02:16,515
Oh, and you might wanna decide quickly...

1622
02:02:16,691 --> 02:02:21,020
... because the people on the other boat may not be quite so noble.

1623
02:02:28,411 --> 02:02:29,442
Stay back.

1624
02:02:29,620 --> 02:02:33,404
Well, now, who are you to decide? we ought to talk this over, at least.

1625
02:02:33,791 --> 02:02:37,374
We don't all have to die. those men had their chance.

1626
02:02:38,004 --> 02:02:41,788
- we are not going to talk about this. - why aren't we talking about it?

1627
02:02:41,966 --> 02:02:44,540
They're talking over the Same thing on the other boat.

1628
02:02:44,719 --> 02:02:47,008
- let's put it to a vote. yes!

1629
02:02:52,310 --> 02:02:54,883
- hello? Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez.

1630
02:02:55,063 --> 02:02:58,099
Jim needs you to pack up and put the kids in the car right away.

1631
02:02:58,274 --> 02:02:59,982
But the units outside...

1632
02:03:00,151 --> 02:03:01,729
Those cops can 't be trusted.

1633
02:03:01,903 --> 02:03:04,857
Jim needs you away from them as soon as possible.

1634
02:03:05,031 --> 02:03:07,985
I'll call them off for 10 minutes, and you'll have to move fast.

1635
02:03:08,159 --> 02:03:11,991
- but where am I supposed to take them? - 25052nd street.

1636
02:03:12,163 --> 02:03:14,037
Leave as soon as the patrol car pulls out.

1637
02:03:14,207 --> 02:03:15,582
Okay.

1638
02:03:15,958 --> 02:03:17,750
She believe you?

1639
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:20,000
It's because she trusts you...

1640
02:03:20,338 --> 02:03:21,417
...just like rachel did.

1641
02:03:21,589 --> 02:03:23,665
- I didn't know... - didn't know what they'd do?

1642
02:03:23,841 --> 02:03:26,593
You're the second cop to say that to me.

1643
02:03:26,844 --> 02:03:28,967
What exactly did you think they were gonna do?

1644
02:03:29,138 --> 02:03:31,380
They got me early on. my mother's hospital bills...

1645
02:03:31,557 --> 02:03:34,594
- don't! - I'm sorry.

1646
02:03:35,144 --> 02:03:37,600
You live to fight another day, officer.

1647
02:03:41,401 --> 02:03:43,227
We found the missing hospital bus.

1648
02:03:43,403 --> 02:03:45,111
Then we have a hostage situation.

1649
02:03:47,198 --> 02:03:49,191
It's a shooting gallery.

1650
02:03:49,575 --> 02:03:51,864
Why would he choose a spot with such big windows?

1651
02:03:52,036 --> 02:03:53,863
We have clear shots on five clowns.

1652
02:03:54,038 --> 02:03:56,790
Snipers take them out, smash the windows, a team rappels in.

1653
02:03:57,208 --> 02:03:58,702
Team moves in by the stairwells.

1654
02:03:58,876 --> 02:04:00,999
Two, three casualties max.

1655
02:04:01,170 --> 02:04:03,044
- let's do it. it's not that simple.

1656
02:04:03,214 --> 02:04:05,539
- with the joker, it never is. - what's simple is...

1657
02:04:05,717 --> 02:04:08,883
...every second, those people on the ferries get closer to blowing...

1658
02:04:09,053 --> 02:04:11,591
- that won't happen. - then he'll blow both of them up!

1659
02:04:11,764 --> 02:04:13,592
- we don't have time for paper ballots.

1660
02:04:13,593 --> 02:04:15,513
- I want everybody to put their votes..

1661
02:04:15,685 --> 02:04:17,678
...on this piece of paper.

1662
02:04:18,730 --> 02:04:21,565
If anyone's got pens, pass it along.

1663
02:04:21,899 --> 02:04:23,691
Thank you. anybody else?

1664
02:04:23,860 --> 02:04:25,687
Coming through. anybody else? thank you.

1665
02:04:25,862 --> 02:04:28,732
We need to get these votes in quickly.

1666
02:04:28,906 --> 02:04:30,449
Come on.

1667
02:04:32,452 --> 02:04:34,575
What are you waiting for? push the button!

1668
02:04:34,746 --> 02:04:36,703
We're running out of time!

1669
02:04:37,999 --> 02:04:39,826
I need five minutes alone.

1670
02:04:40,001 --> 02:04:41,828
No! there's no time!

1671
02:04:42,003 --> 02:04:43,414
We have clear shots!

1672
02:04:43,588 --> 02:04:46,505
Dent is in there with them. we have to save dent!

1673
02:04:46,674 --> 02:04:48,631
I have to save dent.

1674
02:04:48,801 --> 02:04:49,916
Get ready.

1675
02:04:52,764 --> 02:04:55,433
Two minutes, then we breach.

1676
02:05:01,022 --> 02:05:02,516
Fox, I need picture.

1677
02:05:05,568 --> 02:05:08,024
- hello? jim, we're in trouble.

1678
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:11,569
Okay, you got pov on alpha...

1679
02:05:12,617 --> 02:05:14,574
... omni on beta.

1680
02:05:16,037 --> 02:05:19,406
Looks like clowns and hostages on two floors.

1681
02:05:19,582 --> 02:05:21,990
There's a swa t team on the stairwell.

1682
02:05:25,296 --> 02:05:27,918
Another swa t team on the roof.

1683
02:05:29,467 --> 02:05:30,665
Line's clear.

1684
02:05:32,428 --> 02:05:35,133
- barbara, calm down. - he has the kids!

1685
02:05:35,306 --> 02:05:38,556
Hello, jim. - harvey?

1686
02:05:39,352 --> 02:05:42,555
- where's my family? - where my family died.

1687
02:05:45,650 --> 02:05:47,310
Blue team, acquire the target.

1688
02:05:48,987 --> 02:05:51,560
Entry team, set your charge.

1689
02:06:07,505 --> 02:06:09,332
Fox, the swa ts are targeting the wrong people.

1690
02:06:09,507 --> 02:06:11,001
The clowns are the hostages.

1691
02:06:11,718 --> 02:06:13,509
Red team, go! red team, go!

1692
02:06:17,265 --> 02:06:18,676
Entry team, blow and go!

1693
02:06:22,770 --> 02:06:24,181
Don't move.

1694
02:06:25,356 --> 02:06:26,732
Take the shot.

1695
02:06:32,363 --> 02:06:34,023
Those swats are coming in hot.

1696
02:06:34,198 --> 02:06:36,025
Clowns, put down your guns.

1697
02:06:36,534 --> 02:06:39,155
Drop your weapons! on the ground, now!

1698
02:06:39,370 --> 02:06:42,537
Doctors, get down! clear the line of fire. drop your weap...

1699
02:07:07,148 --> 02:07:08,311
Freeze!

1700
02:07:08,483 --> 02:07:10,855
Stand down or you will be...

1701
02:07:14,405 --> 02:07:15,864
Look up.

1702
02:07:16,449 --> 02:07:19,022
See those bad guys on the floor above?

1703
02:07:19,202 --> 02:07:22,203
They're waiting to ambush the swat team coming up the elevator.

1704
02:07:22,664 --> 02:07:23,695
Sixty seconds.

1705
02:07:32,006 --> 02:07:36,585
The tally is 140 against, 396 for.

1706
02:07:44,727 --> 02:07:47,265
So go ahead. do it.

1707
02:07:47,438 --> 02:07:49,431
We're still here.

1708
02:07:50,608 --> 02:07:53,562
And that means they haven't killed us yet either.

1709
02:07:55,029 --> 02:07:56,773
Go, go, go!

1710
02:07:56,948 --> 02:07:58,739
Blue team, cover!

1711
02:08:04,247 --> 02:08:05,907
Trouble on the floor above.

1712
02:08:15,258 --> 02:08:16,633
Get down on the ground now!

1713
02:08:25,059 --> 02:08:27,467
Freeze! stop or we will shoot.

1714
02:08:27,645 --> 02:08:29,638
We will shoot you. drop the officer.

1715
02:08:29,814 --> 02:08:31,356
Release the officer right now.

1716
02:08:31,524 --> 02:08:33,481
Let him go now! on your knees!

1717
02:08:34,068 --> 02:08:36,144
We got him. he's out of the game.

1718
02:08:36,321 --> 02:08:38,812
Keep your hands in the air! step away from the edge!

1719
02:08:46,873 --> 02:08:48,497
Halt!

1720
02:09:01,804 --> 02:09:03,180
Stay down! don't move!

1721
02:09:03,348 --> 02:09:07,641
Be advised. clowns are hostages, doctors are targets.

1722
02:09:13,941 --> 02:09:16,100
Ah, you made it. I'm so thrilled.

1723
02:09:16,277 --> 02:09:19,444
- where's the detonator? - go get him.

1724
02:09:32,835 --> 02:09:35,920
Put down your weapon! don't move!

1725
02:10:07,328 --> 02:10:09,202
You don't wanna die...

1726
02:10:09,372 --> 02:10:12,408
...but you don't know how to take a life.

1727
02:10:12,583 --> 02:10:14,243
Give it to me.

1728
02:10:14,544 --> 02:10:18,873
These men will kill you and take it anyway.

1729
02:10:22,302 --> 02:10:24,793
No one wants to get their hands dirty.

1730
02:10:24,971 --> 02:10:27,925
Fine. I'll do it.

1731
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:32,305
Those men on that boat? they made their choices.

1732
02:10:32,478 --> 02:10:34,767
They chose to murder and steal.

1733
02:10:34,939 --> 02:10:38,142
It doesn't make any sense for us to have to die too.

1734
02:10:47,618 --> 02:10:50,074
All the old familiar places.

1735
02:10:56,377 --> 02:10:57,456
Stand by.

1736
02:11:07,805 --> 02:11:11,388
Red team, floor secure. hostages are safe.

1737
02:11:11,601 --> 02:11:13,677
Give it to me.

1738
02:11:15,104 --> 02:11:18,853
You can tell them I took it by force.

1739
02:11:19,359 --> 02:11:24,270
Give it to me, and I'll do what you should've did 10 minutes ago.

1740
02:11:46,344 --> 02:11:49,677
We really should stop this fighting, otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.

1741
02:11:49,847 --> 02:11:51,674
There won't be any fireworks.

1742
02:11:52,100 --> 02:11:55,303
And here we go.

1743
02:12:34,642 --> 02:12:36,551
What were you trying to prove?

1744
02:12:36,728 --> 02:12:39,682
That deep down, everyone's as ugly as you?

1745
02:12:40,815 --> 02:12:41,846
You're alone.

1746
02:12:48,448 --> 02:12:50,766
Can't rely on anyone these days.

1747
02:12:50,767 --> 02:12:53,952
You gotta do everything yourself. don't we

1748
02:12:54,162 --> 02:12:56,997
That's okay. I came prepared.

1749
02:12:57,206 --> 02:12:58,858
It's a funny world we live in.

1750
02:12:58,859 --> 02:13:01,667
Speaking of which, you know how I got these scars

1751
02:13:01,836 --> 02:13:04,671
No, but I know how you got these.

1752
02:13:22,482 --> 02:13:25,233
Oh, you.

1753
02:13:25,401 --> 02:13:28,438
You just couldn't let me go, could you?

1754
02:13:29,572 --> 02:13:33,486
This is what happens when an unstoppable force...

1755
02:13:33,660 --> 02:13:38,120
...meets an immovable object.

1756
02:13:38,706 --> 02:13:44,127
You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?

1757
02:13:44,295 --> 02:13:47,000
Huh? you won't kill me...

1758
02:13:47,173 --> 02:13:53,425
...out of some misplaced sense of self-righteousness.

1759
02:13:53,596 --> 02:13:56,799
And I won't kill you...

1760
02:13:56,975 --> 02:14:00,759
...because you're just too much fun.

1761
02:14:01,813 --> 02:14:05,976
I think you and I are destined to do this forever.

1762
02:14:06,150 --> 02:14:08,143
You'll be in a padded cell forever.

1763
02:14:08,319 --> 02:14:10,146
Maybe we could share one.

1764
02:14:10,321 --> 02:14:11,780
You know, they'll be doubling up...

1765
02:14:11,948 --> 02:14:14,486
...the rate this city's inhabitants are losing their minds.

1766
02:14:14,659 --> 02:14:17,779
This city just showed you...

1767
02:14:17,954 --> 02:14:21,998
...that it's full of people ready to believe in good.

1768
02:14:22,166 --> 02:14:25,333
Until their spirit breaks completely.

1769
02:14:26,212 --> 02:14:31,040
Until they get a good look at the real harvey dent...

1770
02:14:31,217 --> 02:14:34,004
...and all the heroic things he's done.

1771
02:14:35,680 --> 02:14:40,721
You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle for gotham's soul...

1772
02:14:40,893 --> 02:14:43,811
...in a fistfight with you?

1773
02:14:44,355 --> 02:14:45,897
No.

1774
02:14:46,065 --> 02:14:49,481
You need an ace in the hole.

1775
02:14:49,652 --> 02:14:51,277
Mine's harvey.

1776
02:14:51,654 --> 02:14:53,362
What did you do?

1777
02:14:53,531 --> 02:14:56,532
I took gotham's white knight...

1778
02:14:56,701 --> 02:15:00,319
...and I brought him down to our level.

1779
02:15:00,747 --> 02:15:03,701
It wasn't hard. see, madness, as you know...

1780
02:15:03,875 --> 02:15:06,911
...is like gravity.

1781
02:15:07,086 --> 02:15:09,412
All it takes is a little push.

1782
02:15:26,356 --> 02:15:28,099
Dent!

1783
02:15:49,087 --> 02:15:53,416
This is where they brought her, gordon, after your men handed her over.

1784
02:15:54,175 --> 02:15:55,753
This is where she died.

1785
02:15:55,927 --> 02:15:58,252
I know, I was here...

1786
02:15:59,305 --> 02:16:02,057
...trying to save her. - but you didn't.

1787
02:16:02,350 --> 02:16:04,093
- I couldn't. - yes, you could've.

1788
02:16:04,268 --> 02:16:05,763
If you'd listened to me.

1789
02:16:05,937 --> 02:16:08,558
If you stood up against corruption...

1790
02:16:08,731 --> 02:16:10,938
...instead of doing your deal with the devil.

1791
02:16:11,109 --> 02:16:12,733
I was trying to fight the mob!

1792
02:16:13,236 --> 02:16:18,064
You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself if you knew what I'd lost.

1793
02:16:19,367 --> 02:16:22,487
Have you ever had to talk to the person you loved most...

1794
02:16:22,662 --> 02:16:26,529
...tell them it's gonna be all right, when you know it's not?

1795
02:16:28,209 --> 02:16:32,076
Well, you're about to know what that feels like, gordon.

1796
02:16:32,839 --> 02:16:36,706
Then you can look me in the eye and tell me you're sorry.

1797
02:16:38,469 --> 02:16:42,052
- you're not going to hurt my family. - no.

1798
02:16:42,223 --> 02:16:44,928
Just the person you love most.

1799
02:16:52,942 --> 02:16:55,979
So is it your wife?

1800
02:16:57,071 --> 02:16:58,731
Put the gun down, harvey.

1801
02:16:59,115 --> 02:17:00,775
Harvey, put down the gun.

1802
02:17:00,950 --> 02:17:04,485
Please. please, harvey. please.

1803
02:17:05,872 --> 02:17:07,152
Oh, goddamn it.

1804
02:17:07,332 --> 02:17:09,490
Will you stop pointing that gun at my family?

1805
02:17:10,001 --> 02:17:11,661
No! - we have a winner.

1806
02:17:11,836 --> 02:17:13,330
No, jim, stop him!

1807
02:17:13,838 --> 02:17:15,665
Harvey. don't let him...

1808
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:16,955
Harvey!

1809
02:17:18,343 --> 02:17:20,216
I'm sorry!

1810
02:17:22,013 --> 02:17:23,092
For everything.

1811
02:17:25,683 --> 02:17:27,890
Please don't hurt my son.

1812
02:17:38,029 --> 02:17:39,607
You brought your cops?

1813
02:17:39,781 --> 02:17:42,651
All they know is there's a situation.

1814
02:17:42,825 --> 02:17:45,826
They don't know who or what. they're just creating a perimeter.

1815
02:17:45,995 --> 02:17:48,665
You think I wanna escape from this?

1816
02:17:48,831 --> 02:17:51,583
There is no escape from this.

1817
02:17:51,751 --> 02:17:53,874
You don't wanna hurt the boy, harvey.

1818
02:17:56,172 --> 02:17:59,375
It's not about what I want, it's about what's fair!

1819
02:18:00,134 --> 02:18:04,346
You thought we could be decent men in an indecent time.

1820
02:18:07,141 --> 02:18:08,221
But you were wrong.

1821
02:18:08,935 --> 02:18:12,719
The world is cruel. and the only morality in a cruel world...

1822
02:18:13,481 --> 02:18:15,390
...is chance.

1823
02:18:15,566 --> 02:18:17,274
Unbiased.

1824
02:18:17,485 --> 02:18:18,730
Unprejudiced.

1825
02:18:20,113 --> 02:18:21,227
Fair.

1826
02:18:21,406 --> 02:18:23,647
His son's got the same chance she had.

1827
02:18:24,409 --> 02:18:25,689
Fifty-fifty.

1828
02:18:25,868 --> 02:18:29,320
What happened to rachel wasn't chance. we decided to act.

1829
02:18:29,664 --> 02:18:30,992
We three.

1830
02:18:31,165 --> 02:18:34,581
Then why was it me who was the only one who lost everything?

1831
02:18:37,088 --> 02:18:39,709
- it wasn't. - the joker chose me.

1832
02:18:39,882 --> 02:18:42,171
Because you were the best of us.

1833
02:18:42,343 --> 02:18:47,338
He wanted to prove that even someone as good as you...

1834
02:18:47,515 --> 02:18:49,258
...could fall.

1835
02:18:49,600 --> 02:18:50,881
And he was right.

1836
02:18:51,060 --> 02:18:53,302
You're the one pointing the gun, harvey.

1837
02:18:53,479 --> 02:18:56,516
So point it at the people responsible.

1838
02:18:57,483 --> 02:18:59,310
Fair enough.

1839
02:19:02,655 --> 02:19:04,529
You first.

1840
02:19:17,045 --> 02:19:18,705
My turn.

1841
02:19:25,637 --> 02:19:27,629
Harvey, you're right.

1842
02:19:28,681 --> 02:19:31,303
Rachel's death was my fault.

1843
02:19:34,395 --> 02:19:36,851
Please don't punish the boy.

1844
02:19:37,940 --> 02:19:41,144
- please, punish me. - I'm about to.

1845
02:19:43,112 --> 02:19:45,069
Tell your boy he's gonna be all right, gordon.

1846
02:19:45,531 --> 02:19:47,156
Lie...

1847
02:19:47,659 --> 02:19:48,773
...like I lied.

1848
02:19:52,538 --> 02:19:54,116
It's going to be all right, son.

1849
02:20:32,537 --> 02:20:35,372
Dad? daddy, is he okay?

1850
02:20:51,889 --> 02:20:54,048
- thank you. - you don't have to thank me.

1851
02:20:54,684 --> 02:20:56,475
Yes, I do.

1852
02:21:00,732 --> 02:21:02,060
The joker won.

1853
02:21:04,485 --> 02:21:07,356
Harvey's prosecution, everything he fought for...

1854
02:21:07,905 --> 02:21:09,649
...undone.

1855
02:21:10,158 --> 02:21:12,517
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing

1856
02:21:12,518 --> 02:21:15,069
Our city dies with harvey's reputation

1857
02:21:15,246 --> 02:21:16,409
We bet it all on him.

1858
02:21:17,749 --> 02:21:20,619
The joker took the best of us and tore him down.

1859
02:21:21,210 --> 02:21:22,621
People will lose hope.

1860
02:21:22,795 --> 02:21:24,539
They won't.

1861
02:21:27,050 --> 02:21:28,923
They must never know what he did.

1862
02:21:29,093 --> 02:21:30,920
Five dead.

1863
02:21:31,220 --> 02:21:32,501
Two of them cops.

1864
02:21:32,680 --> 02:21:35,136
- you can't sweep that... - no.

1865
02:21:39,937 --> 02:21:42,773
But the joker cannot win.

1866
02:21:48,029 --> 02:21:51,232
Gotham needs its true hero.

1867
02:21:57,622 --> 02:22:00,658
- no. - you either die a hero...

1868
02:22:00,833 --> 02:22:05,294
...or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.

1869
02:22:05,463 --> 02:22:07,290
I can do those things...

1870
02:22:07,715 --> 02:22:10,752
...because I'm not a hero, not like dent.

1871
02:22:13,763 --> 02:22:16,634
I killed those people. that's what I can be.

1872
02:22:16,808 --> 02:22:18,717
No, no, you can't. you're not.

1873
02:22:18,893 --> 02:22:21,467
I'm whatever gotham needs me to be.

1874
02:22:23,147 --> 02:22:24,262
Call it in.

1875
02:22:27,568 --> 02:22:29,312
A hero.

1876
02:22:29,487 --> 02:22:32,737
Not the hero we deserved, but the hero we needed.

1877
02:22:33,324 --> 02:22:35,862
Nothing less than a knight...

1878
02:22:36,411 --> 02:22:38,119
...shining.

1879
02:22:38,746 --> 02:22:40,371
They'll hunt you.

1880
02:22:40,540 --> 02:22:42,331
You'll hunt me.

1881
02:22:42,834 --> 02:22:44,791
You'll condemn me.

1882
02:22:45,503 --> 02:22:47,792
Set the dogs on me.

1883
02:22:51,551 --> 02:22:53,839
Because that's what needs to happen.

1884
02:22:55,013 --> 02:22:56,922
Because sometimes...

1885
02:22:57,098 --> 02:22:59,256
... the truth isn 't good enough.

1886
02:23:00,143 --> 02:23:02,431
Sometimes people deserve more.

1887
02:23:05,898 --> 02:23:09,813
Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded.

1888
02:23:28,212 --> 02:23:29,872
Batman.

1889
02:23:31,799 --> 02:23:33,543
Batman!

1890
02:23:34,344 --> 02:23:36,301
Why's he running, dad?

1891
02:23:37,347 --> 02:23:38,675
Because we have to chase him.

1892
02:23:38,848 --> 02:23:41,719
Okay, we're going in! go, go! move!

1893
02:23:47,815 --> 02:23:49,393
He didn't do anything wrong.

1894
02:23:52,153 --> 02:23:57,740
Because he's the hero gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now.

1895
02:23:59,160 --> 02:24:00,191
So we'll hunt him...

1896
02:24:03,331 --> 02:24:05,407
... because he can take it.

1897
02:24:07,919 --> 02:24:10,410
Because he's not our hero.

1898
02:24:17,971 --> 02:24:19,169
He's a silent guardian...

1899
02:24:20,348 --> 02:24:22,222
...a watchful protector.

1900
02:24:24,727 --> 02:24:26,008
A dark knight.
